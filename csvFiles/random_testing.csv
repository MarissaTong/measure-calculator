0,"When considering gun violence, I do believe the benefits of a national registry of mentally ill persons outweigh the costs because - similar to the required gun registry and licensing - there should be preventative screening measures for PWMI. Although it is uncertain when PWMI/mentally stable individuals can snap - it is important to make sure screening measures have been established prior to the access of guns at all costs. I believe my viewpoint has grown to be this way after living in Washington, D.C. for 6 years and realizing how rampant and devastating mental illness and illicit drug use has become. Many PWMI in the District exhibit signs of behavior that disturbs the peace (i.e. navigating in the middle of the roads at night/during rush hour traffic, being boisterously intoxicated at any hour of the day, and exhibiting predatorial behavior) - ultimately leading me to believe that registries for PWMI are necessary."
1,"The most important problem to ""fix"" would be access to community care/treatment facilities immediately after psychiatric or prison-related incarceration. Possibly establishing contact with outside resources for PWMI prior to their release could be made by their social workers in order for the structure to be created for these individuals who wouldn't otherwise be able to control/conduct such tasks.  Recidivism rates are horrible for non-mentally ill people, so I could only imagine for PWMI who are often attacked by ""street-corner psychiatrists"" and placed into jail involuntarily, or for nuance crimes. It is important that this problem is fixed because as PWMI drift into the streets there is a decline in treatment facility access and an increase of falling victim to the CJ system due to perceived dangerousness. This is a community that is vulnerable to misidentification, abuse/negligence, and ostracism, which makes deinstitutionalization that much more dangerous."
2,"Within the Western medicine world, we accept the ethical injunction,  primum non nocere, which allows a patient to seek, accept, or reject medical diagnoses and treatment. However, throughout the centuries, mental illness has been attributed to many negative external influences (e.g. evil spirits, immorality, societal stigmas (i.e. ""Not In My Backyard""), and governmental influence (Szasz (2011)). Additionally, mental illness has been treated like physical illness (via laxatives, trephination, and religious-based intervention), has been considered traceable via pigmentation of the skin, violent behavior, and identification/speculation (Slate, Buffington-Vollum & Johnson (2013)). The variation in the views mentioned above may suggest that the self-determination of persons with mental illness (PWMI) is reliant upon the ways society accepts them as rationally minded, or behaved individuals. After reading ""The Myth of Mental Illness: 50 Years Later"" (2011), Thomas Szasz explicates the way we view PWMI is due to the propaganda around perpetrators of violent crimes in media. This factor greatly influences our willingness to consider them full-fledged members of society. Szasz (2011) states that ""depriving PWMI of their liberty and responsibility is a violation of their basic human rights."" However, advocates of PWMI - such as Dorthea Dix, who emphasized improved treatment over imprisonment/punishment - influence the ability of PWMI to be more self-determinant against their stigmas (internal or external) (Slate, Buffington-Vollum &  Johnson (2013)).  In ""Untangling Gun Violence from Mental Illness"" by Julie Beck (2016), it is emphasized the stigma against PWMI increasing negative perceptions from the public -- yet, only 4% of violence is attributable to mental illness in the United States. Moreover, while approximately  26% of people have a diagnosable mental illness over a span of 1 year, only 6% of this population has a severe mental illness (Slate, Buffington-Vollum & Johnson (2013)). Yet, the disproportionate amount of PWMI that (when compared to the general public) are incarcerated as treatment or intervention, demonstrates transinstiutionalization via ""street-corner psychiatrists"" (Slate, Buffington-Vollum & Johnson (2013)).  Meaning - the era of the criminalization of mental illness is influenced by the criminal justice system/law enforcement officers which impose involuntary jail time as a way of subduing, or ""tre"
3,"Jennifer-- I, too, believe that there is still a great deal of progress that needs to be made when evaluating how PWMI is treated/stigmatized in society and governmental propaganda. You make a great point about PWMI being excavated from their communities since they are seen as a nuisance. Honestly, this week's lesson really forced me to look at my internalized prejudices towards this vulnerable population. From what I have rendered thus far, I did notice my fear of violence or the assumption that gun violence in the United States was also due to mental illness had been instilled by external influences (e.g. news outlets) for years. Yet, this discussion did not touch on how mental illness (more specifically -  the insanity defense) is used within the courts and for particular individuals vs. others - almost primarily due to race. I mention this because I think it is important to consider as we evaluate the self-determination of PWMI and their ability to be full-fledged members of society. This is because - even with PWMI being a vulnerable population - there are still legal privileges that can be granted which vary among this population as well. Also, I appreciated the structure of your post. The way you categorized the characterization of PWMI within each era of American civilization made this an easy read!"
4,"Elise -  Very strong way to begin your argument here. I think your point about the stigmatization of PWMI being based on ""social norms"" is a great way to frame the external factors that influence the self-determination and full-fledged membership amongst society. It was very interesting to learn about how much the characterization and understanding of PWMI have evolved over time. However, just as much as our understanding of this community has changed, there are still remnants of misbelief that must be deconstructed within the public perception of PWMI. It was alarming finding out that only 6% of gun violence in the United States is due to mental illness - when only 26.2% of the population is suffering from a mental illness. Which leads me to say - great mention of the TEDTalk and the ""them vs. us"" model - I failed to mention this in my post, but it ties into your point very well and also enlightened me to the subtle forms of discrimination and acts of violence that are aimed at PWMI.  What are your thoughts about the ""them vs. us"" model after reevaluating this topic in retrospect to your life's experiences? Do you notice the stigmatization against PWMI more than you had before? Another point I failed to mention in my post was about particular cases of gun violence that have been coined as mentally ill-related via news/ media outlets. For instance,  depicting The Joker in Batman as a violently insane individual only perpetuates the gumption that PWMI are innately a threat to society. So with that being said - characterizations of violence from PWMI (via physicality, skin color/discoloration, or assumption) should all be invalidated since signs of mental illness are enough to displace an individual in society. Moreover, I do feel that it is important to note that there can still be forms of privilege given to individuals with mental illness after committing a violent crime - but it is due to <a style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 1rem;"" href=""https://medium.com/@laylaiomaha/racism-in-insanity-defense-e1cb8a03d5"
5,"Great point here Alyse, I did not explicitly state the Ancient Civilizations impact/view of PWMI in my post, but your response fostered a sacred memory of mine. While I was in Egypt earlier this year, it was mentioned that there are no homeless people on the streets throughout the day/in the night because it is the family/community's responsibility to assist those in need with housing, food, and other resources. This ties in perfectly with the point you made about this form of community treatment being an impactful way to bring PWMI back into the greater society as full-fledged members.  Thank you for sharing!"
6,"I believe that a president can be effective in bringing about an end to the stigma of mental illness by continuing the conversation surrounding health care being just as important for this community. In addition, it is important that the president's administration continues to put money into low-income communities that need the most mental health assistance. Lastly, the president can be effective by increasing the income for case managers - this would alleviate the burden of high caseloads and access to better living for these caseworkers."
7,"I do think the movement toward reducing benefits for mental health care says that there is less worthiness of mental health versus other issues of health care. This also rolls over into the types of clients who need care because of the lack of accessible/well managed resources and treatment facilities. As we discussed last week, there are less people being admitted, or kept, in treatment facilities - this is a clear indicator that mental health is not the most important health-related service. "
8,"Based on the service member's experiences with medication for mental illness in the military, I would recommend that there should be more breaks between the 12 months of service these service members endure. In addition to other psychological triggers and trauma-related experiences, the side effects of the psychoactive drug use only increase the fragility of mental health. Thus, this seems to be a compounding issue that has no clear indication of fair treatment/successful results. Since PTSD is so easily diagnosed, I believe group therapy is the most effective recommendation (as mentioned in the video)."
9,"In the case that a PWMI does not acknowledge they are ill, I don't believe that society should be allowed to ""step in"" and mandate treatment.  I do believe that it imposes upon an individual's choice of voluntary commitment when pursuing medical treatment - for both physical and mental health. Additionally, there is a myriad of symptoms of the disease that PWMI cope with regularly - many times there is self-stigma that may be used to disguise in public; and other times, the symptoms are so apparent that the general public responds negatively to the sight. From what I have grasped from this weeks lesson, the PWMI population is extremely vulnerable to discrimination and allowing society to ""step in"" and mandate treatment for them would be exploited."
10,"I really find the approach to this week's discussion stimulating since PWMI have no specific age - thus targetting elementary, middle, and high school students would all be ideal. An important variable that comes to the teachings/curricula that would cover these topics would be the sensibility of the lesson as well as a relation to modern-day stigmatization and the prevalence of mental illness. As noted from the  NPR special -Why Teens Should Understand Their Own Brains (And Why Their Teachers Should, Too!) (2018)- young peoples perception of the world continues to grow beyond their 20s, and considerations of socioeconomic difference, risk-taking, and social status are all festering issues for school-aged youth. These social responsibilities seem to force many young people into dark places upon feeling ostracized, or people-pleasing (Nadworny, 2018). Teachings/curricula should particularly contain information regarding the various self-/public stigmas that are against PWMI, as seen in media. As Rusch, Angermeyer & Corrigan, 2005) note media, by way of film and print, have identified three common misconceptions about PWMI, they are maniacs with homicidal tendencies, rebellious/free-spirits, or have childlike perceptions of the world. Yet, PWMI can grow in vulnerability - i.e. suicide, especially in older adults who account for 12% of the US population but account for 18% of all suicide deaths. Many times, these deaths are related to suicide via firearms, hanging, drowning or spousal homicide (<a href=""https://www.aamft.org/AAMFT/Consumer_Updates/Suicide_in_the_Elderly.aspx"">AAMFT). While  ""people with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia...die on average 10-20 years sooner than the general population,"" by suicide (<a href=""https://www.nationalelfservice.net/mental-health/schizophrenia/people-with-severe-mental-illness-die-younger-and-things-are-getting-worse/"">Harrison & Tracy, 2017). This information would be useful among teachings/curricula since normalcy is taught through public notification (from media/film), cultur"
11,"Sayla-- Great reference point here- tying this week's lesson into your own experience with working in a vulnerable population must have really hit close to home. I, too, have had experience tutoring young people and have found their interest/critique in others is based on what they were taught growing up. So when you mention that young people who do not suffer from mental illness tend to find it ""weird"" when other children do, it makes me wonder what the child was programmed to believe about PWMI, based on media or normalization. Additionally, having a curriculum that fits the age group would be ideal since youth do not deserve to be placed within settings that are ""more adult"" due to sensitivity and negative influence (aforementioned in previous classes). Lastly, I really appreciate your suggestion of week by week chats with school therapists because this intervention would assist youth with mental health as it also relates to issues with family, peers, and understanding of self."
12,"Nani--  Great post! I really enjoyed how you presented incentives that you received at different stages of your academic career that helped you understand yourself and the world around you, better. I do feel as though there has been a push to further understand stigmatization in the general society - especially when it comes to PWMI, since over the past decade, this community has been over-criminalized and has received ostracized in media/by the public (Rusch, Angermeyer & Corrigan, 2005). However, you bring up another good point - teachers should have a curriculum for school-aged youth regarding mental illness, but it should be tailored to their age. Mental health is a heavy topic to conceptualize internally and externally, thus an introduction to it at school should begin with a focus on stigmatization and psychosocial development, as seen in  Erik Erikson’s Stages of Psychosocial Development. This is because the lesson can be broken down based on each age group, making it more effective and pivotal based on their modern influences/social pressures."
13,"The law of sensitivity and specificity apply to decisions about civil commitment since the more people who test positive for something, lessen the number of people who will test negative for it. These decisions would apply to civil commitment when examing the erratic prediction of human behavior. For instance, the more people tried under civil law (i.e, individuals tested positive for mental illness) will then lessen the number of criminal convictions, as it provides convincing evidence of future behavior for PWMI."
14,"I consider inpatient commitment to be the larger reach of state authority into an individual's liberty because there are more restrictive, coercive, and discriminatory practices that occur when a PWMI is incapacitated. When a PWMI is criminally committed, they are vulnerable to victimization since law enforcement officers lack alternatives for resolving situations involving this population (as discussed in Week 2). This reality then leads to recidivism via trans-institutionalization, or the fall into the criminal justice system due to mental illness. Conversely, outpatient can have its downsides, but the most prominent criticism seems to be external stigmatization. However, with the increase in quality of life, medication compliance, and the likelihood of treatment after OC, there is a better chance for a PWMI to thrive with civil commitment."
15," I believe that the involuntary commitment of sex offenders is a bad idea after their sentence because these individuals are still being condemned to follow the state's governance on the safety of their lives/their imposition among society. There is still punitive treatment in involuntary commitment facilities, especially since treatment length is shortened and other resources are below the acceptable norm. Despite this form of treatment being proven to reduce recidivism,  the population must be targetted since about 8% of men are actually considered sexual offenders (as mentioned in the video). Aforementioned, the approximate amount of men who are considered sex offenders have predatory behavior toward other inmates, are considered to be sociopaths and have served long sentences. Thus these factors would make involuntary commitment a better idea when seeking to protect the individual and society, post-release."
16,"The controversy behind involuntary commitment involves the coercive and anti-therapeutic treatment experiences, and discriminatory, or stigmatizing biases within the relationships the patients have with their care provider(s) (Washington State Institute for Public Policy, 2015). I believe the appropriate measures of success for inpatient and outpatient involuntary commitment as forms of treatment for the individual in society would 1) be more efficient predictions of human behavior for inmates with mental illness, 2) maintenance of the social goals of inpatient civil commitment (ICC), and 3) maintenance of the outpatient civil commitment (OCC) procedure - especially without force/legal enforcement as OCC avoids the criminalization of PWMI. Washington State Institute for Public Policy (2015) notes that "" all states require that an individual have a mental illness in order to be involuntarily hospitalized."" However, if the predicted dangerousness of an individual is based on demonstrated and perceived threats of violence on self/to others, how likely is this individual to continue this behavior in the future? Furthermore, could this behavior be treated with less coercive enforcement?  As discussed during this week's lecture, the prediction of human behavior is too erratic to be consistent among all civil commitment decisions. Within the videofrom Lesson 3-1 ""How Do Criminals and Civil Commitments Differ?"",  the concepts""sensitivity"" and  ""specificity"" were introduced as a reference point for the reliability of our predictions. The difference between the two demonstrates how the more individuals who are tried under civil law (i.e, individuals tested positive for mental illness) consequently reduce the number of criminal convictions, as it provides viable evidence on the future behavior of PWMI. Moreover, the social goals of ICC can be summarized as required provisions for those who need care and treatment in order to protect society, themselves, and relieve the burden from the family (Washington State Institute for Public Policy, 2015).  The social goals implemented with ICC pose benefit to PWMI who are not aware of their dangerousness to themselves and society. In addition to the welfare of a family who may not be able to afford, or consistently maintain the"
17,"Steve - You brought up a noteworthy point when it comes to treating PWMI - there are not enough caseworkers to PWMI to be able to track/measure the progress of their growth over time in IP or OP facilities. However, if there were, the treatment measure you mentioned would be a reliable predictor of behavior.  It is important to have a consistent measure of interaction over time than it would be to measure one's growth from multiple viewpoints and practitioners. As we learned this week, current predictions can be skewed due to how PWMI test in accordance with false positive or false negative incapacitation. I think this is often due to de facto biases that support perceived threats and dangerousness from PWMI without having actually experienced or witnessed it. However, I do believe that OP would be the most beneficial treatment measure for PWMI as it increases medication compliance, treatment after OP, increases quality of life, and reduces transinstitutionalization. Great post!"
18,"Alyse -  We share the same perspective here and  I really enjoyed the way you communicated your understanding of this week's topic. The purpose of each involuntary commitment is different and serves as a more effective means of treatment depending on the severity of the PWMI. From the perspective of someone who has lived in Washington, DC for the past 6 years, I have bared witness to extremely severe forms of mental illness, conscious and unconscious menacing to society, and the local government's efforts to fund services that are not always guaranteed by the law. So much so that I feel desensitized to how society perceives the dangerousness of many PWMI I have come across, which is why my bias is on outpatient commitment. However, the implementation of inpatient commitment would only deem moral if it is not enforced via discrimination and coercive enforcement. (Washington State Institute for Public Policy (2015) note that all states have a statutory criterion for involuntary hospitalization, in that it is required for a PWMI to be involuntarily hospitalized. Yet, you make a great point, inpatient commitment should only be given to those who need it and pose a greater threat to themselves and society. Thus the severity of mental illness is important when determining the type of care given to an individual- inpatient or outpatient civil commitment. Great post!"
19,"Depending on the severity of the illness, PWMI may have the most difficulty navigating the ""Entrance into the System"" stage, due to the complexity of the interrogations during the interview/investigations process, and especially upon arrest. This stage being the most complex for PWMI does not negate that this interval will  not be difficult for all PWMI, but it does imply that the challenges and difficulties within the criminal justice process will rise at each stage. Furthermore, a crime must be committed and presented to LEO with sufficient evidence for an arrest to be made, or a citation to be issued, which would further disproportionately affect PWMI due to their stigmas on perceived dangerousness."
20," The potential challenges that may arise for PWMI with recent changes in California corrections to shift the responsibilities are the lack of training that LEO has when working with such a vulnerable population. Moreover, since LEO is an example of crime fighters within society, many people also establish their beliefs of “right from wrong” based on the law. Thus, PWMI will oftentimes be considered wrong/flawed and be on the receiving end of lack of resources, funding and attentive assistance. As mentioned, LEO has poor relationships with mental health practitioners, thus the understanding of a PWMI’s dangerousness to society may be evenly dispersed. This means that all PWMI will have more of a chance of getting arrested than being referred to civil commitment.  Possible benefits that arise with the changes to California’s corrections to shift responsibilities to the local jurisdictions is that funding will be solely based on the county to provide- which could show benefit if there is more of an effort in protecting this community through community initiatives that will allow society to understand the severity of MI, it’s signs and symptoms, as well as alternative mechanisms of treatment.  This also allows lower-level felons to be handled at the local level, counties to maintain supervision for lower-level releases, and more parole violators to be handled locally. Additionally, PWMI have a better chance of accessing resources in the community since the local jurisdiction will be aware of the needs of PWMI and with installations of Prop 47 and 57. "
21,"I don't feel as though the conceptualization of ""fair"" is the most appropriate  in this context, because from what I have learned thus far, law enforcement officers (LEO) have brutalized this community longer than laws have been enforced to enhance local jurisdictions/counties interaction with PWMI treatment measures, or sentence length for low-level felons MI. In addition, since LEO tend to have poor relationships with mental health practitioners there is a misunderstanding between PWMI and LEO perception. As mentioned in the video LEO also view prison as an expedited option than referral to civil commitment - thus, PWMI are seen as a hazard and liability amongst society which leaves them vulnerable to the criminal justice system."
22,"The Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) is the most popular pre-booking diversion program for LEO to be trained about understanding and interacting with PWMI. CIT is designed to expose LEO to the signs and symptoms of mental illness, the types of psychotropic medications, de-escalation techniques, and interacting with mental health services. The purpose of this team is to lower arrest rates of PWMI, decrease the stigma of dangerousness against them, and ensure the safety of LEO. I believe that the ultimate benefit of a team like this would impact disfranchised PWMI communities that are targeted by LEO most: racially disparaged or incapacitated peoples."
23,"After reading the Taheri article, the effectiveness of the Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) is effective in concept, but not varied in practice in various local contexts. (Compton et al., 2008).  Aforementioned, the Team was actualized a little over thirty years ago and was established after a PWMI was brutalized by law enforcement. CIT was administered within police departments for the purpose of educating law enforcement officers on how to engage with PWMI, deescalate violence from the mentally ill, reduce arrests, and refer PWMI to mental health treatment facilities via strengthened relationships with the civil commitment system (Taheri, 2014, 2016; Van den Brink et al., 2012; Strauss et al., 2005; Dupont et al., 2007; Watson et al., 2010). Taheri (2014, 2016) note that CIT has had mix findings on its ability to ""r educe stigmatization, direct persons with mental illness to needed treatment programs and away from arrest, and reduce officer injury"" (National Alliance of Mental Illness [NAMI], 2012). Giving consideration to the nuances within the workload of law enforcement officials, Taheri (2014, 2016) note that officers are oftentimes called to the same location or about the same individual on multiple occasions. Thus, the consequential effectiveness of CIT would be the lack of effectiveness, since it is not recertified annually. Additionally, officers are not mandated to be trained in CIT methods (Taheri, 2014, 2016), hence, random or total assignment is necessary when engaging with PWMI.  Therefore, I would suggest that the use of the CIT model for PWMI be implemented for longer than 60 days within the academy. Although the current structure of the police department may not allow for CIT recertification, training about the appropriate use of force is crucial (e.g. New Jersey's Criminal Justice Division (N.J.S.A. 2C:39-6j). Annual recertification for the Team should be required as the demands of PWMI vary across time (Taheri, 2014, 2016), especially since mental health hospitals have decreased their inpatient treatment. This is further validated by the depleted relationships between law enforcement officers and mental health practitioners. Furthermore, after this week's lessons, it is apparent that PWMI require specialized attention and treatment that the criminal justice"
24,"Great post, Asia! I have a question in relation to your viewpoint on the continuance of CIT in police departments - how often do yoy believe the test should be readministered. In my post, I discussed annual recertification being important for the simple fact that many laws and regulations around PWMI are subject to change with societal shifts, while also considering the need to restore memory on best practices for law enforcement engagements with PWMI."
25,"Nani- I'm happy to read that you share similar sentiments as I do on this week's discussion post. It's vital that training for engaging with PWMI is administered repetitiously. But you also raise a great point - why is it that success rates vary by state? It could be the way CIT is administered, or maybe how it is used as a rubric/best practice protocol for law enforcement officers that varies most. What do you think?"
26,"Sayla- Thank you for replying to my post! I really enjoyed reading your response to my perspective on this week's discussion topic. You also raise interesting points that led me to want to expound on my viewpoint, especially when you mention that training should be administered in both the academy and their career. As you mention (in reference to the point I made about Taheri's (2014, 2016) finding that training is not mandated), law enforcement officers should be mandated to have CIT training. It is peculiar that this is a voluntary training, since, as we have learned thus far, PWMI are members of one of the most vulnerable subgroups in society. In addition, they are oftentimes met with the same LEO daily/sequentially in the same location - and if they are mishandled, they are placed back into the criminal justice system that 'can't say no'."
27,"A PWMI that has been jailed over 100 times must feel like the experience is torturous since they are considered hazards while incarcerated and are then subsequently released back into society with a quantity of pills and the assumption that they will be able to navigate the world better than when they were initially. However, PWMI must also feel as though their basic needs aren’t being met since the jail houses are packed with people who experience mental illness from it’s inception to its most severe forms. Lastly, PWMI are such a vulnerable population that the attention and necessary care is oftentimes not given by LEO or mental health practitioners in the prison (as we leaned in the previous weeks)."
28,"I believe jails should measure onset of mental illness, severity of mental illness, and the necessary treatment for the PWMI. This is particularly important when considering the lack of individualized care PWMI receive while incarcerated. If LEO/jails are truly aware of the inmates at the facility, their mental health would be an important variable that effects their recidivism, activity/behavior while incarcerated, and the treatment (including medication) needed."
29,"I think that jail inmates are given too few rights -- although they do have the ability to their constitutional rights (inclusively their 4th, 5th, and 18th Amendments), they are not given appropriate care to manage the basic rights they do have. For instance, freedom of speech is jeopardized if what was verbally expressed by the inmate fails to pass the Turner Test. The Turner Test (as described in the Pt 1 video link) is a four-question diagnostic that assesses if the restriction is based on a legitimate government interest.  This means that conversations allow prisoners to exercise free speech differently - i.e. correspondence with the outside world (letters vs. email), or censorship for obscene or dangerous letters or mail, or restricted calls."
30,"Even though medication costs consume large percentages of jail budgets, I believe they are the most common form of treatment for persons with mental illness in jail because it is a quick/convenient behavior regulating method. Especially since suicide in jails is rampant, and social contact is mostly deterrent, it is important that PWMI in jail have a medication that levels their symptoms.  However, the alternative methods of staff observation every 15 minutes, isolation avoidance, and elimination of hanging materials are also viable ways to treat PWMI. Yet, the teletherapy sessions do seem to be a plausible alternative, but is also impersonal - even when compared to the avoidance/isolation that PWMI face while incarcerated. Thus, the lack of human presence may have the same effect as isolation from social contact."
31,"The use of jails for persons with severe mental illness is inappropriate because the United States relies heavily on incarceration and involuntary incarceration (reference: Week 4-2 and McNiel, Binder & Robinson, 2005). McNiel, Binder & Robinson (2005) found that ""inmates who were homeless and who had co-occurring and severe mental disorders and substance-related disorders were held in jail [more frequently and] for substantially longer than demographically similar inmates who had been charged with the same crimes."" However, with the implementation of Proposition 47 in November of 2014, property and drug offenses have been reclassified to misdemeanors, in addition to Proposition 57 in November of 2016, which allows for early release and consideration for non-violent/serious offenders, are both particularly beneficial for PWMI (Lofstrom, Bird, and Martin, 2016). Proposition 47 and 57 assists with the release of incarcerated PWMI and also reclassifies the offenses they are accused of to lower-level charges. Yet, contextually, these propositions are also advancing the criminal justice system and society at large. For instance, the realignment policy changes have been implemented to ensure public safety (Lofstrom, Bird, and Martin, 2016). As of October 2011, realignment policy shifts the responsibility of lower-level offenders from state to counties - allowing felons and most parole violators to be handled at the local level, and releases to be supervised by counties (Lofstrom, Bird, and Martin, 2016). The benefits of this policy also involve the modification of funding to jail houses and prisons, since not enough funds are provided to counties unless they are punitive. I do believe that this will ultimately destroy the current architectural and operational constraints surrounding people with severe mental illness because both Prop 47 and 57 allow state savings to be spent toward this vulnerable population. Prop 47 insists that mental health and substance abuse services, K-12 truancy and dropout prevention, and victim services are financed which allows for offenders to ""clean up"" their records (Lofstrom, Bird, and Martin, 2016).  Prop 57, subsequently, focuses on rehabilitation, early parole for non-violent offenders, and the ability to earn credits for participating in programs while committed (involuntarily or voluntarily (Lofstrom, Bird, and Martin, 2016). Therefore, the use of state funding for incarcerated PWMI in California aff"
32,"Briana -  I agree with many points that you made within your post - including your first statement on how realignment decreased the number of PWMI who have been funneled into the criminal justice system - particularly by way of Prop 47 and 57 (as I mentioned in my post this week).  But also, you mention jails are typically underfunded and do not have enough staff that is trained to engage with PWMI, which is also a valuable point. Since this population of individuals are isolated from social interaction and are often placed on medication before receiving conversation/talk therapy, their experience while incarcerated has severe effects on their mental health. As you mentioned, rates of abuse by other inmates or jail staff, and suicide increase drastically as a result. This week's lesson definitely made me reconsider the treatment measures that could potentially be more beneficial for PWMI, and it appears that it also inspired those same thoughts for you.  Great post!"
33,"Viviana -  Your perspective on this week's discussion is fascinating. I do agree that a restructuring of the criminal justice system is imperative for the proper treatment of people with severe mental illness who have been involuntarily incarcerated or falsely accused. In addition, PWMI should have more diversion programs and treatment available to them, especially upon re-entry into their respective communities. However, I am not sure I follow your point about realignment increasing the number of arrests of PWMI. From my recollection, the research surrounding this topic has demonstrated that through realignment of the CJS, there has been the implementation of laws and propositions such as Prop 47 and 57. As discussed in week 4, both of these propositions allow for a focus on rehabilitation and funding for mental health, delinquency, and victim services. What is your perspective on these restructural methods?"
34,"Wendy -  Great post! In short, I really enjoyed your reference to Prop 47 because I also discussed this restructural measure in my post. I agree that there are many negative situations that can arise from using jails as a method of treatment for people with mental illness - especially since it can lead to an increase in suicide rates. However, I do believe that both Prop 47 and 57 can have successful results when implementing state funding back to this vulnerable community."
35,"Hey Ka Man-  I think the architectural and operational constraints in this context lead to the lackluster resources and treatment that is given to incarcerated people with mental illness. This can be seen within the facility structure - especially if a PWMI is isolated and held in solitary confinement, or even if the jail is overcrowded with low level offenders. In addition, operational constraints effect if these individuals are able to be removed from their cells and for how long throughout the day/week. Which means that realignment changes these negative impositions by allowing PWMI to have freedom faster- either supervised or at local levels (instead of state or sometimes federal). For instance, the aforementioned propositions specifically target low level offenders who have a chance at thriving in the real world with resources and the ability not to return to prison. Lastly, I do believe that realignment assists PWMI with cleaning up their prior criminal history and lessening their threat to society with the implementation of the Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) and drug and property offenders being reconsidered as misdemeanors."
36,"I don’t believe that it is fair to use risk assessement tools that have been shown to provide poor or misleading evidence about the incarcerated individual(s). There is a benefit of utilizing risk assessment tools in order to observe for recidivism and potential behavioral outcomes upon release, which in these cases would be “fair” to use. However, there is a great risk when it comes to relying on the results of these assessments because there can be potential bias/unaccounted extraneous variables present in all of the data received. "
37,"Mental health professionals would be receptive to the RNR approach, which is a newer model that seeks to lower recidivism by providing individual and environmental risk factor attention.  This is because the practitioner would focus more on the criminogenic risk factors to reduce recidivism by establishing basic needs resources for emancipated PWMI.  However, the focus on the psychiatric symptoms of the individual would partition their reoffense agility from high to low level, if the receptivity is positive. As discussed in the ""Study Says Most Crime Not Linked To Mental Illness"" video, approximately 7.5% of PWMI have committed a crime, but a vast majority are not violent, criminal, or dangerous - as 10% of all crimes are linked to bipolar disorder, with 4% of crimes due to psychosis, and 3% due to depression."
38,"I do not believe that the probation is set up well enough to address the supervision and treatment of PWMI because when consideration is given to the hyper-incarceration of this community for low-level offenses, supervision without proper mental health treatment would not be beneficial. As discussed in my prior post, many PWMI are not violent, especially when looking at the most severe mental health disorders: bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and psychosis. Probation can assist in providing basic needs resources, however, which is important upon returning back to society. Ultimately, the cost-effectiveness of this alternative is most beneficial, but for taxpayers, since probation yearly is $1.5k statewide while being housed in state prison is approximately $50,000  a year."
39,"If I were a participant in a mental health court, I would appreciate that I am included within a status hearing where the individual checks in with the judge more frequently. This approach appears to be more consistent over time, especially if a verdict is needed to identify the dangerousness of the PWMI among society. Mental health court also seems to provide more therapeutic consideration of the PWMI throughout court. Additionally, my participation in the program would save ten thousand dollars within a year, and approximately half a million dollars over two years. However, the stigma raises for PWMI within these settings and handles relatively lower cases due to the demand for mental health treatment upon entering the system. As mentioned in the video, mental health courts can raise the criminalization of PWMI while raising criminal justice control over the citizenry.  Lastly, the traditional court process focuses on the restoration of competency and criminal responsibility - which also makes it harmful for PWMI."
40,"When offering guidance to a Chief Probation Officer (CPO) about the supervision of mentally ill persons on probation, I would first discuss the purpose of the Risk-Need- Responsivity (RNR) Model, then, drawbacks on current empirical datal. The RNR was designed to reduce recidivism, by way of correctional treatment services and it is increasingly embraced for people with mental illness (Skeem, Steadman, and Manchak, 2015). This is because 75-80% of incarcerated PWMI have co-occuring and untreated substance abuse disorders that are often overlooked once imprisoned (Skeem et al., 2015). Skeem et al. (2015) discuss how the programs attempt to reach both public safety and public health goals for justice-involved PWMI,  by identifiying behavioral and cognitive-behavioral strategies for more aligned correctional treatment.  In concept the RNR model is beneficial in context of cognitive-behavioral programs targetting general risk factors to prevent recidivism, as they are shown to be more effective than psychiatric treatment alone, but there are some drawbacks, too.  Similar to the Crisis Intervention Team (CIT), which trains law enforcement on how to interact with PWMI (especially in crises), the RNR responsivity principle has two components that encompass how to intervene with offenders that help them learn and change. However, as discussed in Skeem et al. (2015), the RNR principles were not clearly applied to allocated populations of PWMI in the justice system, leaving generalizability to effect the results of the study.  I also noticed that particular groups of people were eliminated from the study due to typical practice of clinicians (i.e. their preference to ""exclude 'antisocial' clients from treatment and work with more pleasant and complaint lower-risk clients"" (Skeem et al., 2015). In addition, the study had a narrow scope on the public safety goals as it relates to public health and not other subsets. Lastly, since it has been found that ""cognitive-behavioral programs targeting general risk factors are more effective than psychiatric treatment alone"" (Skeem et al., 2015), there is  no empirical data that shows RNR principles have succeeded. Thus RNR priniciples are still vaguely associated to substantial success for justice-involved PWMI, especially because the clinicians proclaimation of noncriminogenic needs may be mistakenly interpreted as demands for special attention (Skeem et al., 2015). Subsequently, explicating incomplete know"
41,"Briana- I was impressed by the statistic presented by Peterson et al. (2014) as well - which indicates that only 7.5% of crimes committed by PWMI are directly caused or proceeded by symptoms of their illness, this is because it is crucial to identify the real reason why a MI person is incarcerated. Meaning, the RNR model would help provide further clarity on the possibility of recidivism for violent or civil offenses by PWMI and place them in correctional therapy that will assist their personal needs. Additionally, your proposal to the Chief Probation Officer is something that got me thinking - Briana. I really like your proposal and feel as though this would be great advisement as specialty probation program is an alternative method to traditional probation that also has not shown effects on violence from PWMI. Thus, violence is not always a reason for a crime committed by PWMI. Great post - I definitely agree with your points - and they resonate greatly with my own post."
42,"Cornise- I found that your post reflects mine in many ways - however, your reference to roughly 15% of people on probation/parole has a mental illness really caught my attention because it relates back to the use of the Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) in my opinion. I think that RNR attempts to have the same effect when engaging with PWMI as it has found that correctional treatment is more beneficial than psychiatric treatment (Skeem et al., 2015). However, RNR -like CIT- fails to present true success through empirical data, which is where the method falls short as being a reliable suggestion to the Chief Probation Officer. Additionally, your suggestion of having mandated training for LEO is also imperative within the academy since this vulnerable population demands special attention each time a call is received by LEO to intervene. Great post!"
43,"A PWMI that is confined to a constricting environment - such as prison - would be highly compromised (clinically) and isolated (socially) from the common world. This may further increase any symptoms the person is currently experiencing, which leads to a domino effect of consequences. I do feel as though the structure of this institution is set up to fail persons with mental illness since it is a door that does not deny patrons, and over-excessively houses those who are seen as obstructions to society. Since people with mental illness are not given a fair chance outside of prison, they will not be given better treatment within the facility (that especially houses felons and has longer sentence lengths)."
44,"No, I do not believe that it is possible to truly rehabilitate prisoners with mental illness. Despite having ""community health centers"" (which were terminated due to lack of enforcement and funding) there is also a lack of consistency between the treatment received (I.e. managing medication, psychiatric treatment, etc). Also as discussed, some individuals experience stress, depression, or anxiety upon entering and leaving treatment facilities and imprisonment does not support these transitions or behavioral symptoms. As discussed in the video, people who were abused prior to incarceration have a tendency to commit a similar crime to those around them, especially if physically abused (when compared to sexual abuse)."
45,"The advantages of solitary confinement for PWMI when maintaining prison order by lessening the number of fights or physical abuse from other inmates. PWMI are also charged with violating facility rules at a higher rate, while also accounting for higher susceptibility to physical injury or verbal assault. This would protect PWMI from these targets, however, there are many disadvantages to this form of isolation. Disadvantages of solitary confinement for PWMI include exacerbated mental illness symptoms, longer sentences (via time being added to their sentences), and doubled rates of victimization. Additionally, there is less screening and treatment, thus, their isolation only allows the mental illness to fester and grow more severe."
46,"Based on the video, I can understand the motivation to assist PWMI, but I do have a perspective that may contradict my initial standing on this conversation. I think that this is a beneficial income that, when distributed properly, will grant more effective treatment resources for incarcerated individuals suffering from mental illness. However, as discussed in the video, states have shown poor financial responsibility when providing to disadvantaged communities, which would not provide consistency for PWMI. Consistency is what is needed for PWMI, especially while intoxicated because the need for proper medication administration, behavioral group therapy, or clinical assessment becomes much more important. "
47,"Therefore, I would rather have my tax dollars go toward providing more resources outside of prison/jail or allocate funds going to incarcerated PWMI to afford bail, in order to have a better chance of receiving proper treatment and a better life."
48,"Fyodor Dostoevsky once said ""the degree of civilization in a society can be judged by entering its prisons"" and I believe this sentiment to be true. Prisons fail to meet the needs of PWMI and maintain safety for them, as well as the staff because the institution is not designed to treat those it houses (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, and Johnson, 2013). Since the federal government has continued to decrease financial allocation toward mental health care, this has shifted the burden onto the criminal justice system (by way of state and local governments (Slate et al., 2013)). Fellner (2003) asserts that the wealthy are granted better access to mental and behavioral health care, which leaves incarcerated PWMI vulnerable to the lack of public-funded treatment that's available. As a result of this, state and local prisons become de-facto psychiatric hospitals for PWMI (Enstminger, Geller, Stanley, and Jaffe, 2008). Baillargeon, Penn, Knight, Harzke, Baillargeon & Becker (2009) have found that those with co-occurring psychiatric and substance abuse are at a higher risk for multiple incarcerations over a 6-year period when compared to other inmates who suffer from one of the disorders alone. This can lead to an increase in the jail/prison population and the seriousness of the person's mental illness (Adams & Ferrandino, 2008). However, prisons can best meet the need of PWMI and the staff by referring to Wilper, Woolhandler, Boyd, Lasser, McCormick, Bor & Himmelstein's (2009) study which found ""26% of federal inmates and 40% of state inmates had been taking medication for their illness at the time of arrest."" This is useful information because it allows for further inquiry about proper treatment measures for incarcerated PWMI. In addition to this, staff would be more aware of why the affect of PWMI is erratic, catatonic, or psychotic - thus benefitting their safety measures/methods. Yet, I do feel as though it is important for PWMI to receive more resources than other inmates suffering from mental illness because, despite the expense (Slate et al., 2013),  as it is callous to leave a PWMI untreated within living conditions - i.e. a prison or local jail (Adams & Ferradino, 2008). PWMI are also in a greater need for treatment as their symptoms can exacerbate when they are in isolation, experiencing physical or verbal harm,  or lack of medication intake. In view of the fact that the staff is oftentimes wearing multiple hats when it come"
49,"Ka Man,  Thank you for responding to my post. For clarity, the costs of treatment (no matter how expensive) is necessary for PWMI, as it would increase the security of staff and the MI by way of training for proper interventions/treatment. The two (costs and safety) work in tandem, from my perspective."
50,"Ka Man,  Thank you for responding to my post.

51,"Bobbie-  Thanks for responding! To answer your first question, I referenced the article to imply that PWMI are generally not treating their symptoms, and if they are, there is a chance of inconsistency. Thus, the worsening/exacerbation of current symptoms, especially upon entering the criminal justice system. Additionally, this could mean that specific treatment could result from this understanding. Lastly, Slate et al. (2013) do, indeed, discuss the costs of medicine for PWMI but it would be more beneficial for community-based interventions as it allows PWMI to have an enhanced quality of life, greater access to resources, and influences recidivism rates."
52,"Asia-  Thanks for responding to my post! You made a great point here, but to answer your question, yes! I do think that it would be extremely helpful for COs to undergo CIT training throughout the academy and also while active. CIT, if administered annually, would allow LEO/COs to have a better understanding on how to engage with PWMI. This would imply knowing who to intervene with erratic behavior from a PWMI, or how to provide them with the proper treatment/resources so that they won’t end up in jail.  I think this is the ultimate benefit for a PWMI since they are more susceptible to incarceration for petty crimes, and they will be treated by mental health practitioners that can manage their symptoms for effectively than a clinician in jail/prison would."
53,"Honestly, I would be upset about the construction of the new Fulton State Hospital since my tax dollars would go towards the construction of the facility. Despite it being safer and more useful for modern treatment, they are relocating mentally ill persons into a cleaner facility. In my opinion, this does not alleviate the fact that many of these people have suffered brutal treatment at their previous facility, and those traumas can evolve greatly within a new space (especially in group therapy sessions). It is definitely a clever way of trying to protect the MI from harming themselves or others, but it's almost as if they are sprinkling glitter on the bigger issue."
54,"I would most definitely describe the 'Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity' a ""Get Out of Jail Free"" card when used for an implicitly, or explicitly tactful reason. NGRI appears to be a plea deal that allows the mentally ill to reenter society and receive treatment from care providers, and receive assistance from other clinical resources. However, this only allows the mentally ill more access to disrupting society further since (as I recall from earlier lessons within the MLFP) offenders often lie about their residence, and without the proper surveillance, PWMI may fail to attend their treatment programs or fail to maintain their medicine intake."
55,"I think the initial step towards improving the engagements between the staff and patient would be to increase the amount of staff within the facility and administer training and roles accordingly. It was devastating to hear the stories of the workers who have experienced brutality from the patients, in addition to their anxiety about going to work each day - however, there are also many factors that place the hospital at fault for these incidents. For instance, allowing janitorial or culinary staff to manage the admitted MI people completely violates HIPAA, and leaves all parties extremely vulnerable to erratic behavior. Thus, hiring more mental health doctors, and clinical therapists to evaluate the specific treatment PWMI need is important (especially when accounting for the data on treatment heterogeneity)."
56,"After watching this video, I am in a state of bewilderment because the success rate/effects of this simulation are unknown. Yes, I am happy that the people that experienced such debilitating mental disorders underwent this procedure and have noticed substantial differences in their health overall; however, this is a clinical trial. Although my perspective on the deep brain stimulation treatment is ""anti,"" I do not believe in the mechanics of modern medicine and surgery to ""fix"" a person's mental illness. As discussed in the lecture, PWMI are oftentimes biologically/hereditarily susceptible to mental illnesses - e.g. schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder. With that in mind, social treatment is more useful for assisting PWMI in managing their symptoms."
57,"The most appropriate role for state hospitals versus the criminal justice system is that it provides better safety and behavioral treatment for people with severe mental illness (e.g. major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder). Sisti, Segal, Emanuel (2015) have found that ""half of all prisoners have a mental illness or substance abuse disorder; [while] 15% of state inmates are diagnosed with a psychotic disorder."" As discussed in The California Departments Annual Report (2018), ""s ome of these jail-based programs treat patients before or instead of them going to a state hospital while others treat patients as they transition out of a state hospital setting."" In view of this, alternatives such as the Conditional Release Program (CONREP) or the Los Angeles Community-Based Restoration of Competency Program (California Departments Annual Report, 2018) provide either intensive regimens of treatment and supervision or restoration of competency services that will assist wrongfully incarcerated PWMI. Additionally, PWMI are oftentimes introduced to the criminal justice system, because of untreated symptoms of psychosis or chronic homelessness, and because it is an inexpensive solution for housing the mentally ill (California Departments Annual Report, 2018; Sisti, Segal, Emanuel, 2015).  Thus, treatment is not the primary reason for PWMI winding up in the criminal justice system - which, as discussed in previous lessons - can exacerbate the symptoms of the mentally ill. I believe assisted  treatment for PWMI sort would be beneficial as the severity of these mental illnesses can vary in detriment to their safety or the security of others. Sisti et al. (2015) support this belief with their finding that this measure of treatment is the most effective especially since PWMI who have been recently released are left with little support. This is because incarceration has stripped away PWMI access to public assistance and requires them to enroll - which can be unnecessarily laborious (Sisti, Segal and Emanuel, 2015). Furthermore, state hospitals should be used exclusively for forensic patients as transinstitutionalization led to a 95% reduction in the country's state hospital population (Fisher, Geller, and Pandiani, 2009; Sisti, Segal and Emanuel, 2015); whil"
58,"Sayla-- I agree with your post! I, too, believe that state hospitals should be used to treat PWMI before entering the criminal justice system. This is because falling into the CJS is the most inexpensive form of housing PWMI, but it does not offer the proper treatment that is needed when managing mental illness. You make a great point by mentioning that allocation of resources to state hospitals should be used to treat PWMI, however, do you find state hospitals more beneficial then outpatient treatment options? I think both would provide security and safety for all people (both the PWMI and external forces), and would rather my tax dollars go toward allowing PWMI to live amongst society other than in solitude. Additionally, what are your thoughts on drug administration? Sisti et al. (2015) note that PWMI are often left without resources once released, but new drugs allow PWMI to live independently within their community."
59,"Elise--  Great post, to piggyback, I feel like it is vital to provide consideration to how the treatment is being administered to PWMI. This is especially true because incarcerated PWMI are no longer eligible for assistance once released, so they must reenroll (Sisti et al., 2015). Furthermore, state hospitals should be used exclusively for forensic patients as transinstitutionalization led to a 95% reduction in the country's state hospital population especially around the 1940s and 1950s (Fisher, Geller, and Pandiani, 2009; Sisti, Segal and Emanuel, 2015); while  macroeconomics and federal policies, outpatient therapy and drug administration is a cheaper alternative than inpatient care ( Sisti, Segal and Emanuel, 2015). Thus, due to the push out of PWMI in toxic treatment facilities, there should be an effort to readminister original forms of treatment with new medicine to assist with the most severe, or untreated cases. Thank you for sharing, you definitely have me thinking further about how this program can allow me to impose on this movement."
60,"The information presented in these videos was comprehensible, but a way to better tie the agencies together could be through an inclusive data base, or outreach to agencies that have worked with the individual/PWMI so that they are able to defect the matter or assist more appropriately."
61,"The CIT approach appears to be much more thorough at evaluating the persons surroundings. In the video, you can clearly see the law enforcement officers state that they have had training to be able to assist, and they also removed the medication from the immediate site of the PWMI. In addition, the law enforcement officers were aware of external resources that can assist a PWMI during crisis. I think this is extremely useful, because every case is different but it is important for law enforcement officials to know how to constructively assist during a crisis and, if they are not sure how, to know who to contact, when and for what purpose."
62,"I think that the community is greatly overlooked and will often be at the mercy of government control when it comes to care. Additionally since there is still developing information on how to properly interact with a person with mental illness, the government intervenes as a “know all” when average citizens are unaware. Also, when considering medication adherence or hospitalization, the government is able to regulate these matters and have a say so on the appropriate behavior for varying cases."
63, I think mental health workers may have challenges when it comes to the correctional environment because as discussed - they are often misunderstood. There may be a disconnect in the resources provided in order for mental health practitioners to do a substantial job at treating and assisting incarcerated PWMI. I do feel as though cross-training can help correctional agencies/ staff better understand the needs of PWMI within these spaces and also strengthen their relationships with mental health practitioners alike.
64,"In my opinion, I do not believe that this method would violate HIPAA law since the agency would interact with the individual on behalf of further police/criminal justice involvement. With consideration of the individual's history (especially with substance abuse or mental illness) documented by their most recent medical or treatment-care provider(s), this would ensure that the PWMI is on the receiving end of proper/more informed care. This is especially true if LEO are engaging with this population without CIT training."
65," The essential training for mental health and criminal justice actors should involve the implementation of Crisis Intervention Teams (CIT) and ethnographic comprehension. As previously discussed in earlier lessons, PWMI are 2 times more likely to be arrested for disorderly conduct than any other population - this is also coined ""frequent flyers"" -  as it describes a PWMI with higher contact with LEO/CJS. With 15% of PWMI being federal inmates, 26% as state inmates, and 25% of jail inmates having a mental illness (Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) Report; Ditton, 1999), Best Practice models are necessary within law enforcement agencies before initiating any engagement with a person suffering from mental illness when reporting to a scene.  Essential training should be interactive with all major parties who are affected by a person with mental illness in order to reduce the use of force during LEO encounters. This is why the Crisis Intervention Team (CIT), which involves the collaboration of police, mental health services, and communities to respond to mental health crises (Watson and Fulambarker, 2012) is beneficial at advocating for interventions tailored to the key stakeholders' implementations. The article makes a substantial finding that indicates approximately 15% of CIT trained LEO engagement with PWMI involves force since they utilized low-lethality methods especially when subject resistance increased. Furthermore, the researchers note that the Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) is a collaborative approach that allows the needs of a person with mental illness to be addressed. CIT pursues this goal by way of linking the PWMI to appropriate services that ultimately redirect them from falling victim to the criminal justice system. Furthermore, Jim Parson's research (as seen in the  YouTube video), conducted in Washington D.C., evaluated PWMI and their interaction with the criminal justice system/agencies, and how their mental health needs are met. Parson (2012) found that many experienced a lapse in referrals to the proper mental health services, and only had this benefit once being released back into the community. This is because PWMI are passing through the systems quickly- which is equally as important and understandable when accounting for the influx of recidivism rates for PWMI. Yet, there are many people who suffer from men"
66,"Steve- Great post! I pretty much agree with the totality of your points; and was inspired to reconsider other factors that affect PWMI when their needs are overlooked by LEO (e.g.: a broad overview of how PWMI interact with the CJ system and any common neurological or cognitive disorders such as mental retardation, autism spectrum, Alzheimer's, TBI, etc.). An understanding of how PWMI interact with LEO is extremely important before or upon utilizing force. In addition to neurological or cognitive disorders that may or may not be evident - especially during the interaction. Meaning, a PWMI is still able to present well, but be the victim of brutality. What are your thoughts on this? I  would also like to expand on the importance of allotting more time for training to occur. When you referenced this, I assumed you mentioned training within the academy - as the Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) has begun to be implemented worldwide, yet its benefits are still being explored. However, as we learned in previous weeks, this training is offered on a voluntary basis and is not offered beyond the training process for aspiring LEOs. Knowing this, it is clearly explicated that PWMI are oftentimes disadvantaged by not only the severity of their symptoms but also by LEO who are not fully aware of how to engage with the population."
67,"Caroline- You pose some really thought-provoking details about the articles covered this week. Do you believe that the Crisis Intervention Team  (CIT) relates to the enhancements you are referring to? Or, is there another mechanism that can be useful? I really appreciate the goal and collaborative efforts of the community, mental health workers, and police to ensure the safety of PWMI. What are your thoughts on the Team? It is extremely vital since this population takes up a small demographic in the United States but is subjected to harsh treatment and interactions with the criminal justice system when compared to free society. For that reason, I, too, believe that there needs to be an intervention-based method that allows LEO to engage with PWMI by lowering force and increasing treatment assistance. From the videos presented in this week's lesson, it appears to be an effective approach to intervening with a PWMI in crisis/exhibiting erratic behavior. Thanks for sharing!"
68,"It was really alarming to me that this video is centered in Fairfax County, Virginia -- as I currently live in Washington, DC and this program has really made me interested in the laws and policies that shape the DC Metro area (D.C., Maryland, and Virginia). The diversion efforts that focus on non-violent offenders is crucial at negotiating the treatment they receive while incarcerated, by allowing them to have more of a voice and different engagement/treatment mechanisms during their sentence. As seen within the former inmate, and current Peer Support Specialist, Kevin Earley, who was able to become the liaison between the PWMI community and the CJS's treatment team, after being a part of a jail diversion program. I believe what should be done with violent offenders, who are also people with mental illness, is to provide them with similar resources based on their character within the jail/prison. Thus, I think violent offenders who are PWMI should be given the same resources as nonviolent offenders, but their character must be assessed for temperament and interest."
69,"I think the hurdles are different for criminal justice and mental health agencies when implementing evidence-based practices because their mechanisms can vary. Mental health agencies are trained, and more than likely seasoned with experience when it comes to particular PWMI who fall back into treatment centers over time; however, the criminal justice system is still learning how to manage this community of people.  In addition to this, I believe that, when working together, it would be a lot more beneficial for PWMI as they will receive more tailored services for their needs and not find themselves within the walls of a jail/prison as much."
70,"I think an integrated mental health and substance abuse model like the one described in the video, would change the way the justice system works with people with mental illness with co-occurring disorders by implementing standardized screening, data to steer the direction, and integrated services. Standardized screening measures are an innovative method that is readily accessible, but not used the most. PWMI are also prepared for the collateral damage of their incarceration as their socioeconomic status and familial presence are weighed, in addition to their criminal records - which ultimately affect their hire-ability. "
71,"I think peer mentoring will be helpful in addressing stigma of mental illness because each person is learning from the other on how to heal and recover from the setbacks of their mental illness. It is important for these individuals to create and have a safe space that will allow them to feel like they are not an outsider. In addition to this, it allows for these individuals to connect on common ground and learn new ways, or even share their ways of coping. It appears as though a varying perspective can do a lot for PWMI who have debilitating disorders, and can often inhibit their illness from taking deeper plumages into severity and personal/physical isolation."
72,"The full implementation of the recommendations of the position paper of the American College of Physicians affects the involvement, identification, treatment, and outcomes of the mentally ill in the criminal justice system by way of integrating behavioral health care into primary care, promote funding of public and private health insurance, and increasing the most efficient approaches to integrating these measures (Crowley & Kirschner, 2015). The true effectiveness of this recommendation would come in the form of pre-exposure for people with mental illness, as this would enable an easier screening process for employees in the jails and prisons who are unaware of how to manage this vulnerable aspect of the incarceration experience. Yet, the full implementation of these recommendations may have a direct effect on how people with mental illness such that their health outcomes improve - thus lowering their risks of interacting with law enforcement/the criminal justice system (Crowley & Kirschner, 2015).  This is important because as we learned in the previous weeks, PWMI are oftentimes in a revolving door when it comes to recidivism, and are often arrested for minor/misdemeanor charges. Additionally, there are approximately 1/3 of patients with mental illness are more likely to use primary care without insurance for such severe mental disorders (Crowley & Kirschner, 2015); while approximately 1 in 5 youth suffers from a mental disorder. Thus, identification and treatment measures must take into account the financial support that will be needed in some cases, as well as more effective integration screenings to be administered in order to alleviate the re-identification process upon entering the jail or prison. Lastly, access to greater quality care is also essential as training of staff would be required to accurately handle crisis situations (Crowley & Kirschner, 2015). Crowley and Kirschner (2015) note that the training would also include how-tos on screening, managing and treating common behavioral health conditions within people with mental illness in order to provide the most cost-effective assistance. In conclusion, this added layer of protection will allow PWMI to receive treatment, and more resources that are also more cost-effective to the community. Especially when targeting particular demographics, such as young people, there is a higher chance that the full implementation of the recommendations will be more effecti"
73,"Nani-- I found your post to be extremely inciteful, as you provided statistics to support your perspective on this topic that really expanded my view on the prompt. However, I would like to speak on the part of your post that resonated with me the most. When you mention there is about 32% of undiagnosed adults who turn to their primary care physician for mental/behavioral health concerns, while only 4% actually turn to a mental health professional. As we learned in previous weeks, I do believe this is because PWMI are often at a disadvantage since these resources may not be present in/near their community, and they are not always the most enthused about seeking assistance (especially when they are unaware of the severity of their symptoms). Yet, if these treatment mechanisms are administered properly, and to young people, there may be .a greater outcome of effectiveness over time. Thank you for sharing!  "
74,"Briana- Great post! I share similar sentiments as you this week and found myself drawn to ask you a question about your perspective on how young people are affected by this issue. How do you see this topic affecting youth? Do you feel as though the implementation of the recommendations mentioned in the American College of Physicians article will be most effective for this population over time, especially when compared to adults? Since approximately 1 in 5 youth suffers from a mental disorder, I believe that identification and treatment measures must take into account the financial support that will be needed in some cases, as well as more effective integration screenings to be administered in order to alleviate the re-identification process upon entering the jail or prison. This will ultimately lower the trauma youth experience upon re-entering the jail or prison and being screened for illnesses. What are your thoughts on this?"
75,"Honestly, this is a hard question for me to answer due to my own personal interactions with people who have a mental illness. Some of these individuals have had violent outbursts and if you had asked me if I wanted a gun thrown into that situation my quick and adamant answer would be no. With that being said, I know there are numerous people out there who have been diagnosed with a mental illness and have had no acts of violence and would never even contemplate hurting anyone. Putting people in this category into a national registry would benefit no one and would only degrade people who are seeking treatment for their mental illness and attach an undeserved stigma to them. This kind of stigma only acts as a deterrent for others who wish to seek out treatment but are afraid of being treated like a second class citizen. However, having those individuals who have a documented history of violent behavior on a registry can be beneficial not only for the public but more so for the individual suffering from the mental illness. Many people with severe mental illnesses who are not being treated or are becoming frustrated at trying to find the right kind of treatment can become suicidal. Placing the mentally ill on a registry can have its benefits but it is a fine line of trying to protect people in society (including the mentally ill) and not taking away the rights of the mentally ill that are afforded to them under the Constitution."
76,"The most important problem to fix, and by no means the easiest, is the mentality people in society have when it comes to individuals who are suffering with mental illness. Society needs to be educated about mental illness, the different types of mental illness, and the fallacies that come with a diagnosis of mental illness. People need to understand that not all mentally ill people are violent, in fact, there is a very small percentage of those who are. People also need to be informed that recovery is indeed possible. That those suffering with mental illness can become an active member of society including holding down a job and having a family. However, it takes more than just the right kind of medical treatment. It takes the support of family, friends, neighbors and coworkers. A lack of funding for treatment, a lack of support for housing and employment all comes back to fear. People tend to fear what they do not understand or what they may see or hear from people who have very little education on the subject matter itself, such as the media. Until society begins to understand the truths surrounding mental illness there will continue to be challenges in funding for treatment, housing, employment, and healthy support structures. These challenges will only continue to impede recovery and the continued criminalization of mental illness as they filter in and out of the criminal justice system."
77,"Given the various beliefs and explanations for the causes of mental illness throughout history, and the fluctuation of feelings from fear to healing, those suffering with mental illness have had to struggle to become a part of society while fighting to stay alive. The false beliefs that the mentally ill were possessed by evil spirits or demons led many to be tortured and/or murdered if they could not conform to the norms of society. Mentally ill individuals were often institutionalized against their will where they were ridiculed, harassed, and harshly punished. Those who were housed in these institutions had no control over their own care. The mentally ill were stripped of their civil liberties including the right to any type of legal proceedings regarding institutionalization. This type of treatment of the mentally ill came from the belief that those suffering with mental illness were incapable of caring for themselves, making decisions about their own welfare, or were extremely violent. As time went by those suffering from mental illness have worked hard under the anti-discrimination and civil rights laws to be protected from persecution in the work place, in educational environments, and to limit involuntary hospitalization. There also have been laws put into place to initiate better care and conditions in these hospitals as in the case of  Wyatt v. Stickney (1972) where a federal judge ruled that patients have the right to individual treatment that will give them the best opportunity to better their mental condition and the best chance for recovery. He further stated a failure to provide such treatments was an infringement on a patient’s due process rights. A shift in thinking by those in power led to deinstitutionalization and the need to move patients into a more community-based care where patients would feel less isolated, more empowered, and a part of society. Patients would have the opportunity to be more in charge of their care and lead a more independent life. However, due to lack of federal funding this plan failed to be fully implemented and the mentally ill faced a different kind of struggle-surviving the streets. People in society who began to have more contact with mentally ill people saw them as dangerous and violent. The treatment mentality began to shift to that criminalization with the mentally ill ending up in jails. The willingness of the public to consider them full-fledged members of society was nonexistent. A new belief"
78,"Hi Alyse, I also had wished the Greek and Roman period would have been gone into a little more extensively.  It makes me wonder if maybe we could still learn something past cultures in terms of how we can treat others and help mentally ill individuals who are members of our society. Ignoring the mentally ill, placing blame on the mentally ill, and casting them aside is not an answer to the problem. In order to help the mentally ill gain treatment and incorporate them back in society we first need to accept them as a full-fledged member of society. Thank you for your thoughts. Great post. "
79,"Hi Liisa, I think when it comes to mental illness it fits into the category of so many other things that the public feels are out of the norm. As you stated for the most part PWMI faced attitudes of sympathy that varied between somewhat dangerous. This fluctuation depended on what was being brought to light in terms of treatment, how long it was kept in the lime light, and who was in power. Support now more than ever is key as the uncertainty of whether treatment programs will be available is ongoing. Support also helps PWMI to embrace those treatment programs that are available and helps them to go to these programs on a more consistent basis. Support helps these individuals realize its okay to have a mental illness and it is nothing to be ashamed of. It becomes more manageable and less of a stigma. Great post!"
80,"One of the ways a president can be effective in bringing about an end to stigma of mental illness is to publicly talk about it to bring more awareness to it. He can also go out and talk to people with mental illness demonstrating to the public there is no need to fear those who are suffering with different types of mental illness. Putting out public service announcements stating the truth about mental illness and even some of the myths. Showing a united front with people suffering from mental illness is key in helping to end the stigma. Most importantly, more funding needs to be allocated to help those who are suffering with mental illness by helping them to obtain affordable treatment so that they can become fully active members of society again."
81,"From my perspective, it seems as if policymakers view mental health as the fault of the individual instead of as a true illness that needs treatment like any other illness. Never is the stigma so apparent than in cases where federal funding gets cut. It is as if policymakers are trying hard to distance themselves from individuals with mental illness as if they are a stain on society and because of what they brought upon themselves are unworthy of the help only federal monies can bring. To me, policymakers seem to view individuals with mental illness as second class citizens and the bottom of the barrel of society. People with mental illness are not looked at as human beings who suffering and need treatment just the same as a person with cancer who is suffering needs treatment. Policymakers do not seem to comprehend that the brain is also an organ that can suffer from different illnesses and they do not seem to care about these individuals until it strikes at home or affects their election points."
82,"After watching the video I just have to say I agree with the soldier's view of providing support for people from people who have undergone the same traumatic events as they have. I can relate to this personally on two accounts as my father was an alcoholic for many years after his return from Vietnam. He could not talk to anyone about what he had seen or done and he did not want to take the chance of being judged by others who could not possibly understand. What changed is when he went to a support group for Vietnam veterans and was able to talk and relate to others who were suffering from the same things he was such as depression, PTSD, and alcoholism. This helped to see that he was not alone and allowed him to express himself in a comfortable and welcoming environment. Being in law enforcement there are also a lot of things I have witnessed and have had to deal with and our department offers a program called Peer Support where you can talk with other peers about things that have affected you and what the other person has done to deal with these feelings whether it be guilt, deep sadness, or stress. Psychiatric services are also provided in this program.  A majority of the time medication really is not needed but just a sense that you are not alone and what you are feeling is okay and normal."
83,"No, I do not believe society should be allowed to ""step in"" and mandate treatment as that is taking away the liberty and responsibility to care for themselves. It would be no more beneficial than the punishment people with mental illness faced when they were involuntary committed for extended periods of time without being a violent danger to society or themselves. I believe we as a society have the obligation to intervene and try to explain to people with mental illness the severity of their illness and the possible outcomes if they do not seek treatment. Society should also inform them treatment is available and where they can find it. However, in the end, the decision of whether to obtain treatment must be in the hands of people with mental illness just as it is with any other person suffering from any other form of illness. "
84,"Having a curriculum in mind when it comes to teaching young people about mental illness needs to be adapted to the age of each group. Elementary school children may benefit more from a story or book that puts mental illness into simplistic words that they can understand instead of medical terminology. These books or stories should contain the different types of mental illness, the myths surrounding mental illness and the feelings those with mental illness may have when faced with the stigma that is surrounding them today. This should be presented to children by a child psychologist who is better capable of relating to children and may be in a better position to answer some of their questions in a way that they can comprehend. Helping children to understand that having a mental illness is nothing to be afraid or ashamed of may help them to treat individuals, including other children who have been diagnosed with a mental illness like anxiety, depression, or other behavioral disorders, with compassion. This in turn will help to  reduce the stigma. Middle school and high school youth should be educated using a different approach. They are old enough to understand the seriousness of a mental illness yet young enough to react to people with a mental illness in an entirely juvenile way, such as name calling and bullying in a more physical nature. I would offer a more educational class to kids in this age group. Schools have often offered short lived classes on physical and reproductive health but rarely on mental health. This type of class can educate youth on what mental illness is, myths on mental illness, the stigma related to mental illness, who to reach out to if they feel they or someone they know maybe suffering from mental illness. A class like this can also teach those in this age group how to take care of their own mental health when stressors from school, home, and social life become overwhelming as many of these youth turn to drugs, alcohol, or thoughts of suicide. Again, I believe a psychologist should be brought in to help address questions adequately and intelligently. It would also be beneficial if they could have a speaker come in who is suffering from mental illness to talk about what they have, the preconceived misconceptions, their struggles when it comes to stigma from the public, and what they wish would change. This would help the students in this category to see the true reality come to life as opposed to something they just rea"
85,"Hi Elise, I agree that not enough is done in our educational system to inform youth about the symptoms of mental illness, the stigma of mental illness and how that stigma affects those who are living with it. I am interested to hear your ideas on what certain types of programs that can be put into use, or if due to the increase of focus on mental illness, do you know of any programs that may have already been implemented in any state? It seems that if there were they would be more at the high school level as opposed to the grade school level. I believe school educators on a grade school level may feel that the concept of mental illness is to complex for young children to understand forgetting that children in this age category can be diagnosed with one too. Great post!"
86,"Hello Viviana, you bring up an interesting point as far as getting mental health check ups. While I think this is an excellent idea and would benefit many the only drawback is I feel many adults and parents would refuse this due to the stigma that already exists. Adults would not want to go because they would argue they are not crazy and should not have to be subjected to mental health check ups. Parents would not want their children to be looked at as different or have the implication that something must be wrong with them already if they are receiving mental health check ups. It is disappointing that something so beneficial can be cast aside based on bias and misinformation. Great post!"
87,"When a person is being evaluated for mental illness to determine whether he or she should be civilly committed it is important that the psychological tests being conducted have a high specificity and high sensitivity rate. High specific rates seldom miss a negative outcome and high sensitivity rates are often dependable in catching true positives. This means that high specificity  positive test results can be used to diagnose those who may have a mental illness and negative results in a high sensitivity test can be used to rule out mental illness in other individuals. False positives and false negatives can have a detrimental impact on society and the individual as they can either release individuals suffering from mental illness out into society without receiving the care and treatment they so desperately need or they can confine people with no mental illness into treatment hospitals receiving medical treatment for something they do not even have. False negatives can also lead to those suffering with mental illness into brushes with the criminal justice system instead of treatment hospitals. False positives can take individuals with no mental illness away from family, friends, and their jobs and possibly leaving them to deal with the stigma that is mental illness as they now believe they have one."
88,"This question is more complicated for to me to answer having built a career in law enforcement, however, I am going to try to be more pragmatic in answering this question. I believe involuntary commitment for sex offenders can be a good idea depending on what type of sexual offense it was. For example, the man in the video committed a sexual offense against an adult woman (I am guessing rape) at the age of 16 years old. He served his sentence and I believe he should be released. Given his young age and the fact he had not fully matured mentally to grasp the consequences of where his life was headed due to his actions, I believe there was a good chance that he could have been rehabilitated. His rehabilitation should have started from the moment of incarceration in a juvenile facility. This type of rehabilitation should have included not only therapy for his violent actions but also some type of job skills to help him when he is finally released. He was sentenced to a certain amount of time in prison which he served. Involuntarily committing him is now imposing upon him a life sentence that does not fit his crime. In my opinion, that just seems like another crime we as a society are committing. When it comes to sexual predators preying on children, however, my thoughts change. I believe child sexual predators should be involuntarily committed. I believe it is much harder for these individuals to be rehabilitated as their crimes often continue for many years. These types of predators have a hard time dealing with their own illness and urges even while they are serving time in prison for the crimes they have committed against innocent children. For me, I believe it needs to be looked at on a case by case basis and I believe they have the right to be screened, evaluated, and appear before a judge."
89,"Inpatient and outpatient commitment is to an extent a larger reach of state authority, however, it is often warranted in cases such as when the person is a threat to his- or herself or others in society. As was stated in the video this often includes individuals who have attempted suicide or may have exhibited violent behavior. There are also those who cannot care for themselves medically, provide clothes, food, or shelter for themselves, or just have a hard time making it through each day. I believe the ultimate goal is to eventually to have them leave any type of commitment and become productive once again in their own lives. I do not believe we should wait until people finally meet the criteria for inpatient commitment before the state gets involved and the damage to peoples' lives is already done. Those who already met the criteria for inpatient commitment are there not because society is trying to take away their liberties but simply because the likelihood of them seeking out and obtaining treatment is low and the potential for harm and/or death is very high. It comes back to parens patriae where the government has the obligation to act as the legal protector of those who are unable to care for themselves."
90,"Civil inpatient commitment is grounded in the fact that the government has a duty to protect individuals who may be a danger to themselves and/or to other members in society. Involuntary inpatient civil commitment allows the state to help individuals with a mental illness who would not seek out treatment on their own. By involuntarily committing those who are mentally ill to a psychiatric facility they receive the supervised 24-hour care to help protect them from inflicting harm on themselves. The purpose of these types of inpatient commitments is to help these individuals cope with their mental illness and help reintegrate them back into society. It also takes the responsibility off of families who have tried unsuccessfully to help their loved ones seek treatment only to see their mental state decline. Although the purpose is that of treatment and relief, involuntary commitment has downsides that go along with it. For example, involuntary inpatient commitment can be seen as a loss of liberties for many patients as few have control over their treatment options or even length of stay. Many patients have often felt forced into complying with their treatments through verbal threats and commands. Inpatient civil commitment may also feel stigmatizing to some which is why many choose not to seek out treatment from the beginning. Those with mental illness do not want to be seen as violent and unapproachable. Outpatient involuntary commitment provides those with mental illness a less restrictive way to obtain treatment with a feeling of control while still being an active member of society. Unlike involuntary inpatient commitment, there are various treatment options to choose from. First is the conditional release from a hospital where individuals can participate in mental health treatments knowing that if they fail to complete this treatment they can brought back for inpatient treatment instead. Second, community treatment may be authorized instead of the use of hospitalization. Preventative outpatient commitment is the third type of commitment. It's focus is to prevent those with mental illness from reaching the point where they become a danger to themselves or others. It involves forceably medicating those suffering from mental illness as a means of protecting them and society from future occurrences based on the patient's psychiatric history. Some of the issues with this form of commitment is that it begins to take on the same restrictions as criminal commi"
91,"Hello Tamara, I really enjoyed your post especially the part about the false negatives and false positives that some of the tests doctor's use can give. I also chose outpatient therapy as the best method and my reasoning was due to it being the least restrictive method for those who are not a danger to themselves or society. Although there is not enough research to prove this is the best method due to outpatient civil commitment being rarely used in many states it allows for patients to feel less stigmatized by being in the community and pressures them to participate in treatment in order to stay in a more familiar and comfortable environment. Although this may be seen as coercive, it is a less punitive alternative than inpatient with more freedoms. I feel inpatient commitment should be restricted to those individuals who pose a serious risk to the well-being of themselves and society as a whole and refuse to acknowledge the seriousness of their condition. Great post!"
92,"Hello Sayla, you are absolutely correct when you stated programs for the mentally ill are underfunded. I also believe that is the main problem right there. We cannot offer mental health services including therapy and medication if there is no money to fund them. I disagree though on letting inpatient civil commitment patients choose their own therapy as most did not want to seek help to begin with and are often non-compliant. Also, those be treated in an inpatient civil commitment facility are usually there because they have a grave disability and pose a threat to themselves or to others. I do believe however, that the terminology should be changed as it stokes fear of outbreaks of possible violence from those suffering with mental illness. I chose outpatient civil commitment as having more of a chance at success if some elements were to change such as proper funding and more implementation. Although it does not give the patient the opportunity to pick which treatment they will receive, involuntary outpatient commitment gives the patient more of an opportunity at a normal life. Thank you for you insight!"
93,"I believe the stage that would be hardest for people with mental illness to navigate would be the arraignment stage where they are informed of the charges against them and are asked how do they plead. I believe it would be hard for them to understand what the charges are, the severity of the charges in terms of misdemeanors or felonies, and what kind of sentencing comes with pleading guilty, not guilty, or no contest. The four stages are in other peoples' hands in terms of investigation, evidence presented, sentencing by the jury and then corrections. I think the criminal justice system is hard for the general public to navigate and for someone who may not be in touch with reality it becomes harder even with legal representation. Those who are suffering from mental illness may not be able to fully comprehend the legal terminology  that their attorney is using and most importantly their attorney may not have an understanding of what mental illness entails or how to interact with people who have a mental illness. This gives people suffering from mental illness a disadvantage when it comes to entering in a sound plea and comprehending the possible outcomes of their plea."
94,"With the shift of large numbers of felons to local jails one of the benefits that people with mental illness may have is that of treatment. Instead of being overlooked as just another number, as they would in state prisons with huge populations of prisoners, they may now be able to get the medical treatment they deserve. Unfortunately, one of the challenges that may arise from this shift is the lack of funding for the medical care of the now large general population in the local jails and also for those inmates who suffer from mental illness. Even if prisoners are recognized as being mentally ill and treatment is afforded to them, how long can it continue if there is not enough funding? People with mental illness will soon be released back out onto the streets with nowhere to go and no possibilities for treatment. This system will not provide long term care for PWMI but only set into motion a cycle of prison-jail-street. If the correctional system in California really is intent on making changes they need to start with specific funding that is set aside for treatment of people with mental illness within the jail or prison system including the possibility of care once they are released. "
95,"Having worked in the law enforcement field for over a decade this is a hard question for me to answer. As a police officer your job is to help people not just the ones who come out and speak calmly to you and politely ask for your help. Your job is to protect and serve the public as a whole and that includes those suffering from a mental illness. I think what makes these types of situations unfair is the fact that so many police officers have very little training on how to deal with PWMI as if receiving training on this issue is showing people with mental illness in a bad light  because they require a specific way to be dealt with. Not only should police officers be required to have training on how to deal with PWMI but they should also be required to take basic communication classes. I say this because I believe a lot of the new trainees that come out of the academies have lost some of their communication skills due to the fact they come from a different generation that was grounded in technology. Learning about the different types of mental illness, how they affect people and coupled with a communication skills class could very well help reduce the number of violent encounters police officers face with those suffering from mental illness. "
96,"The Crisis Intervention Team and stigma are related because through the 40-hour training that the the Crisis Intervention Team receives it helps responding police officers to understand the types of mental illness and how it affects individuals suffering from them. Police officers are trained on the types of psychotropic medications and side effects of these medications. These officers are also being trained how to interact with the mentally ill and how to help get them treatment instead of arresting them. Due to this training, police officers have begun to develop a less stigmatizing attitude towards the mentally ill and treat them less like a criminal and more like a member of the public who needs help. This destigmatization helps to increase the chances of treatment for the mentally ill and reduce the possibility of injury or death for all involved."
97,"Despite the lack of evidence of the effectiveness of the CIT model in the Taheri article I would suggest continued use of this model for reasons such as safety and education. Most officers coming out of an academy have no direct knowledge of the different types of mental illness, the various symptoms and the variety of medications that PWMI take and the side effects these medications may cause. Although the effectiveness of the CIT training programs appear to be minimal, for officers having an a better understanding of where PWMI are coming from and what they have to go through is still beneficial as police officers can begin to see them as citizens who are in need of help and less like criminals that they have to subdue and arrest. Due to the fact different states have various versions of the CIT model that is used in Memphis it would be helpful to share information to see what is working for some other agencies and what is not. Having the ability to look at statistical data to see how many arrests of PWMI were made, how many needed medical care for any injuries they sustained from an arrest, how many officers suffered injuries due to trying to make an arrest, how many of those suffering with mental illness were taken to a medical facility for treatment and how many were released to their families after the situation was deescalated. Data like this will help to agencies to see what is working for them and what is not. The type of training that is offered in the CIT model should be a yearly training for all department personnel and should be considered a perishable skill. Officers should hear from the families of people with mental illness as well as psychologists, psychiatrists, and even from people with mental illness so they can get a first person account of what happens to them when they have an episode and what they feel. Differentiating between calls for crimes and calls involving the mentally ill is a concept that should continue to be used as it may help the police officer's mindset going into the call including recalling his training and his first move as he pulls up on scene. Finally, I believe that included in the training should be other police officers who have been on the job for awhile and can recount their interactions with PWMI and how they handled the situation and what they did right and what they may have done wrong. These types of scenarios are important for the younger police officers to hear who may lack experience in dealing with"
98,"Hi Gabriela, I agree with you that there should be a better way to evaluate if the CIT training is effective and I believe it is going to take statistical data from numerous departments to have a better understanding of what is working and what can be improved. I also spoke with one of my friends who had been a police officer for more than 20 years and he said one of the main things that should be implemented along in the CIT training is how to communicate better not only with PWMI but how to communicate with people in general. With technology advancing people are losing more of their communication skills as they can now easily correspond with someone in a short text. Being able to communicate and listen to those with mental illness can help in the deescalation of many situations and you are correct in stating helping to classify these calls may help officers know exactly what they are getting into and how to respond. Great post!"
99,"Hi Danielle, I also agree that even though the Taheri analysis provided no concrete proof that CIT training actually produced viable results, the fact that officers now had some knowledge about mental illness and how to deal with people with mental illness is an achievement. Just the fact they felt more comfortable and confident in handling calls concerning PWMI is a step in the right direction in terms of safety for all involved including police officers. Lowering the stigma that officers may have placed on PWMI and helping them to better understand their needs will only benefit PWMI in having the ability to obtain the help they need from a medical standpoint instead of going to jail where their mental health can only deteriorate further. The CIT training does need to be reexamined to pinpoint what may not be working so well for PWMI and the community and what they can build upon. Great post!"
100,"I think for people who are mentally ill having to be arrested and jailed more than a hundred times becomes the norm. With jail comes certain benefits such as temporary shelter, food, and treatment, however, with this repeated cycle of arrest and jail sentencing comes at a price. For people with mental illness they now have to deal with the loss of certain liberties, an extensive criminal record, and in the end, no real solution to the problems they face such as lack of continued treatment on the outside and life back out on the streets. I believe PWMI would begin to experience even deeper feelings of hopelessness and depression as the realization that jail has become what their life is all about."
101,"I feel the first indicator jails should measure about mental illness are the medical treatments that are provided. Are the different types of medical treatments being used in treating the mentally ill in the jail effective? Measuring the effectiveness of the treatment being used in the jails may help these institutions to understand how to improve their ways of treating those with mentally illness. For instance, instead of just relying on one medication perhaps maybe a combination of two or medication mixed with therapy.  The second indicator that should be measured is out of those who were undergoing different types of treatment for their mental illness which ones had the highest recidivism rate? Measuring those who had the highest recidivism rate may help jails to better understand what may or may not be working in terms of treatment and possibly help to direct those with a low recidivism rate where to go in terms of continued treatment once they are again released. And finally, the third indicator that should be measured is what can be done to prevent individuals with mental illness from entering into the correctional system to begin with? This will help lower the jail population and help PWMI obtain the necessary medical treatment they need and most likely not receive from jails which are basically ill equipped to handle all of the inmates who have various mental illnesses due to lack of funding and staffing. Not to mention the fact that jails are more of a punitive environment not a treatment environment which makes it difficult for PWMI to want and accept treatment."
102,"This question is hard for me to answer for a lot of reasons including one being that I used to be a deputy jailer. I understand the concept of jail inmates rights like free speech, medical care including the right to treat their mental illness, and the freedom to practice their religion behind bars. However, I do not understand why they should have the right to a free college education when law abiding citizens like myself are still trying to pay off their degrees. Inmates medical coverage is free and so are their meals yet their are men and women on the streets with nowhere to go and they are unsure of where their next meal will come from. I know basic necessities like food and medical care is mandated or else it becomes a matter of inhumane treatment however, in my opinion, many criminals are no longer afraid of returning to prison. Inmates know their rights and they know what should be afforded to them right down to how much television time they can have. Prison starts to feel less and less like a punishment and more like a way to pass the time. The general inmates know what they did was against the law  and made a willful choice to act. I feel in these types of cases their rights should be taken away too. Mentally ill inmates are different because during an episode they are incapable of fully comprehending what is going on, why they are being arrested, and ultimately why they are serving time in jail. Their intent was never to maliciously carry out a crime. Mentally ill people do not need bars they need treatment and support."
103,"There are a number of factors why I believe medication is the most common form of treatment in jails. For one, it is easier for jailers to deliver this form of treatment to the inmates, it is also easier for the inmates to agree to this form of treatment and be compliant with it in such a restrictive setting. This form of treatment also allows the jails, which are already overburdened with large populations of mentally ill people, to treat these individuals in large masses and in a more timely manner. Talk therapy and even telepsychiatry are directed towards more of a one on one treatment program. These types of therapies are not feasible with such a large population of mentally ill people in the jails and not enough psychiatrists employed to treat them. Long term treatment is directed at those individuals who plan on continuing treatment on the outside but do that fact that limited services exist in the community even this treatment is not an option. I also feel it just easier for those who work in the jail to give them those pills, keep them medicated until they serve their time and then release them out into the community to fend for themselves. Unfortunately this is only treating a symptom and is doing nothing to help mentally ill people find real treatment and a chance at a better life."
104,"I believe using jails to house the seriously mentally ill is inappropriate for numerous reasons including the lack of size from an architectural standpoint. Jails were constructed to house inmates for a relatively short amount of time. Housing the seriously mentally ill in a confined space even for a relatively short amount of time can exacerbate their symptoms. Jails are also made up of a mixture of different people from serious, violent offenders to those inmates who were convicted of nonviolent misdemeanors to housing the seriously mentally ill. Because of this composition of violent and nonviolent offenders, jails have now become tumultuous in nature which can place those with a serious mental illness in grave danger as it may be hard for them to defend themselves. As someone who used to work in a small county jail, I can attest to the fact that they are underfunded and usually understaffed. This makes caring for those with a serious mental illness difficult to do especially when it comes to providing adequate mental health care. Also, because county jails are underfunded there is the issue of obtaining adequate training for jail personnel to help identify those with serious mental illness and how to interact with them. Jail personnel need to know a variety of factors now and what rights a mentally ill individual has in comparison to the rest of the population. These rights include the right to treatment for their illness and even the right to refuse all treatment. Jails now have the responsibility of weighing the rights of that individual with a mental illness from a legal standpoint against the safety and security of the jail and the rest of the inmates. The Realignment policy, in my opinion, has only affected PWMI in a negative way. They are now being housed in a more confusing and unsafe environment with no guarantees of receiving treatment for their mental illness. If they do receive treatment it will only be for a short amount of time as jails are used for short stay inmates before they are released back into the community. PWMI will then have no other options for treatment outside the jail which means their return into the criminal justice system inevitable. PWMI have to deal will personnel who are not adequately trained on their illness or how to interact with them which means they may be restrained and confined for longer periods of time. Most importantly they are being housed with people more dangerous than themselves as there is no room f"
105,"Hi Liisa, you bring up some great points especially when it comes to those who are mentally ill having the ability to go into a treatment facility rather than having to serve jail time. Orange County Sheriff is currently transforming one of their jails into a strictly mental health facility where the mentally ill can be brought in for treatment if they are arrested by deputies for a crime. I know this does not provide an all out answer for once PWMI are released out into the community but I believe it is a step in the right direction instead of housing them in the county jail. At least this way PWMI are segregated from the general population. Great post!"
106,"Hi Briana, I also agree with you that due to Realignment the resources allotted to treat PWMI has dwindled at the county level. This has only led to more PWMI entering into the criminal justice system and leaving with a criminal record instead of much needed treatment. Although I do not agree with using jails to house individuals with serious mental illness, I do believe if that is a last resort there should be an attempt to segregate PWMI from the rest of the general population for their own safety. Jail personnel should also be adequately trained to be able to identify and interact with the mentally ill. However, given the lack of funding even simple solutions like that might be difficult to enact. Great post! "
107,"In my opinion it is unfair to use risk assessment tools not only because they are not 100% accurate but also because as was stated in the video probation officers deal with a diverse group of individuals. You cannot apply one set of tools to every individual person and expect the outcome to conform to these different individuals situations. As was said in the video, probation officers deal with millionaires, those who are destitute, those who are uneducated, and those who have college degrees. These felons come from various backgrounds and have committed different degrees of crime therefore using standard risk assessment tools to apply to their situations may be one reason they are considered not fully accurate. You are also restricting each of these individual's potential for rehabilitation and change. These tools may be used for guidance but ultimately I think a multitude of factors should be taken into consideration like criminal history and severity of the crime and all should be done on a case by case basis."
108,"I believe mental health professionals would be open to the RNR approach with PWMI in the justice system due to the fact this model tends to focus on not only the individual but also on the factors that are related to the crime. These factors include substance abuse, having friends who are anti-social which can lead to anti-social behavior for the individual himself, and poor work or school performance.  Treatment, much like rehabilitative treatment that is given to inmates, focuses on the learning ability of the person with mental illness. This type of treatment is often given through different cognitive behavioral techniques which enable PWMI to change their way of thinking and helps lead to better decision making. Other factors that may be of concern to health professionals for PWMI under supervision in the community is noncompliance with medications and ongoing treatment, the inability to find a job, homelessness, and the stigma by the community of a PWMI living among them. "
109,"I believe when you compare probation to the jail system, probation is more well set up to address the needs in terms of supervision and treatment when it comes to PWMI. Probation is more focused on rehabilitation whereas the jail system is more of a punitive environment. Probation looks to seek out those who can be supervised in the community, while due to the overcrowding in the jails, inmates have had to be released out into the community early whether they met those requirements or not. Each person on probation has their own caseworker and case plan for success in this process. They can turn to their caseworker when they need help finding housing, employment, or other services. This in turn often leads to a strong bond between the individual and the caseworker which may even help with compliance as probation officers have the duty of following up with their clients. Those who work in the jail do not offer any kind of services that may help PWMI on the outside in the community and often do not have the funding or resources to care for them while they are incarcerated. In the jail system PWMI are not typically seen as a specialized group the way probation chooses to see them and jail personnel are not given extensive and continued training the way probation officers who work specialized caseloads are."
110,"Being a participant in a mental health court would be a double edged sword for me. I say this because on one hand I would be in a more welcoming environment where my best interest would be at the forefront. The court would be looking at available treatment options for me as compared to traditional court processing where I feel I would be treated more like a criminal than a person with an illness. In a mental health court I would not have to worry about seeing jail time (if the offense was minor in nature) as opposed to a traditional court which carries the possibility of a jail sentence now giving me a criminal record and little hope for treatment. That being said, the only downside about appearing in a mental health court is the related stigma that goes with it as more people in the community may come to find out that I have a mental illness. For some community members, including potential employers, that is worse than being an individual with a minor criminal record. I would definitely still pick treatment over an overcrowded jail but there is a burden that each still carries in the end."
111,"Although the RNR model has gained more acceptance it has been cautioned by some researchers that focusing intensive treatment only on higher risk offenders with mental illness while excluding lower risk offenders can have its own risks. The risk principle used is aimed at public safety and not improvements in mental health. Behavioral health needs for both groups need to be addressed. Focusing on one group alone to provided services for criminogenic needs negates the mental health symptoms those in this population may experience preceding criminal behavior such as delusions and hallucinations. While focusing on factors that can be changed, such as substance abuse and anti-social behavior, without the necessary treatment for their mental illness being applied in conjunction with this may not be as effective. As the article stated, symptoms should be treated for those mentally ill individuals involved in the criminal justice system not just a small minority of them. My guidance to a Chief Probation Officer would be in supervising mentally ill individuals on probation is to constantly be in contact with mental health services and work in conjunction with them to ensure that those individuals with mental illness who are being released out into the community have a strong support system. Cognitive behavioral techniques which can improve cognitive function and antipsychotic medications may help control a person's symptoms and focus mentally. This may help to reduce the recidivism rate among mentally ill people on probation in the community. I would also advise the Chief Probation Officer of being too quick to group those individuals with mental illness in a homogeneous group. Every individual is different with various symptoms depending on their illness as well as a different degrees of severity. Treatment should be individualized and risk factors for every person may interact differently with one's mental illness. Finally, I would reinforce to him or her that the goal for people with mental illness involved in the criminal justice system is not just one of public safety but one of public health as well. This mentality is important for him to pass down to those who will be supervising this population out in the community to mitigate not only recidivism but possible injury to personnel and those with mental illness."
112,"Hi Danielle, I thought the best answer to give the Chief Probation Officer would be to work in conjunction with mental health services to not only help implement the components of the RNR model but to also help people with mental illness take part in the treatment in a more functional way with the help of antipsychotic drugs. I also advised against restricting services to lower risk population as people with mental illness may have symptoms that vary and individuals in the lower risk population may be susceptible to the same risk factors that precede criminal activity. The final factor which I believed to be important when supervising people with mental illness out in the community is that it is about not only protecting the public but also about protecting the mental health of those who have a mental illness. Thank you for sharing your personal insight."
113,"Hello Sayla, I also agree that the RNR should not be used on its own, however, I do believe it can be useful when used in conjunction with other mental health services such as psychiatric services and antipsychotic drugs. One of my suggestions was also to be cautious about grouping all people with mental illness together as every individual has a different diagnosis with a varying degree of severity. Implementation of individualized plans is essential for cutting down the rates of recidivism as well as maintaining a good relationship with the person you are supervising.  Addressing not only the criminogenic needs but the mental health welfare of the probationer are two key factors for in attempting to reduce the rate of recidivism. Great post!"
114,I believe the prison environment can easily aggravate the conditions of people with mental illness based on several factors. One of those factors is the noise level and the multitude of people talking. This can be stressful when you hear an array of voices talking at different levels from different directions. Mentally ill people do not respond well to high stress situations and in a prison environment you have different people telling you what to do and where to go. Then there are the loud alarms that go off when rioting or inmate fighting occurs and you have prison guards throwing anyone near the situation to the ground and subduing them and sometimes mentally ill individuals can get caught up in this if they are near by. Mentally ill people are at risk for assault by other more potentially dangerous inmates causing symptoms of their mental illness to heighten. This in turn may lead to solitary confinement as punishment which may be more detrimental as now they are isolated and afraid. All of these factors can cause mental illness in these individuals to worsen and if left untreated may cause more of a debilitating effects with more outbursts and more punishment.
115,"I believe it is possible to rehabilitate prisoners with mental illness if some key factors are put into play. The first that I feel is most important is monitoring the mentally ill out in the community. We have a whole division of the criminal justice system that is dedicated to the monitoring of individuals that are released from prison. Why can't we have one that monitors those individuals with mental illness released from prison out into the community to ensure they are compliant with taking their medications as part of their release? The emotions of those with mental illness also need to be taken into account not only upon an individuals entry into the prison but upon their release as stress from these transitions may heighten feelings of depression, anxiety, and fear. Programs need to be implemented to assist PWMI on how to interact with others, how and where to seek help for their mental illness upon release, and assistance with any substance abuse issues they may have. The mentality of those inside the prison has to change from one of punitive to one of patience and assistance as PWMI sometimes appear stand offish when they are feeling threatened or stressed but in all actuality they are afraid and in distress. Something that was said in the video from the Assistant District Attorney Craig Thompson indicates that the mentality may be hard to change as he commented on some serial killers who became so due to them being mentally ill and not taking their medications. As studies have shown, PWMI rarely commit acts of violence and until this mindset is changed and more programs are put into place to benefit PWMI the road to rehabilitation will be long but it is possible."
116,"Although I understand the need to maintain order in a prison environment due to the large inmate population I can not help but feel that putting those troublesome inmates in solitary confinement only makes the situation more volatile. Inmates who may have displayed behavioral issues either by fighting, attacking wardens, or being insubordinate by not following the rules should be dealt with in a way that addresses the issue and not punished in a way that will make the behavior worse upon release back into the prison population. As stated in the video, the inmate who was in solitary confinement for 10 days experienced feelings of paranoia, violent thoughts, and heightened sensitivity to sound. Solitary confinement seemed to lead to mental breakdown in reality. When the inmate was released he was more anti-social and he began to lose a sense of himself. All of the symptoms he was experiencing are also seen in a number of mental illnesses. Protecting other inmates and prison staff should be at the forefront, however, using this type of technique as punishment can only make the circumstances more dire for all involved if inmates continue to experience symptoms like paranoia and violent thoughts when released back into the general population."
117,"This question is a little difficult for me to answer because I understand completely in terms of wanting to separate the mentally ill from the general population and provide them with the necessary treatment as opposed to punishing them for acting out when they are not on their medications or imposing such severe punishments on them like solitary confinement which may worsen the symptoms of mental illness. My hesitation is who will be monitoring their treatment on the inside? Are the wardens ensuring compliance with medications? Will be there be other forms of treatment besides just medications as in therapy by psychiatrists? And finally, will there be any available services to PWMI once they are released back into the community? I am not against my tax dollars being spent on treating the mentally ill in prison as they do have a medical condition that needs to be addressed, however I would like to know how my money is being spent and if there is a concrete plan for actual treatment that will make a difference. I also believe we need to have more community based programs for treatment for PWMI who have committed low level crimes instead of handing down a prison sentence. "
118,"Prisons can work to keep inmates and staff safe by implementing some practices from the very beginning. As inmates first come into the prison they should be assessed to help identify any ongoing or potential mental health problems they may have and the need for treatment. Once inmates who have a mental illness are identified a second assessment should be done to see if they pose a danger to themselves or to others such as the staff or general population. Mentally ill individuals should also be screened for any other significant disorders which may co-occur with their mental illness such as substance abuse. There needs to be a shift in mentality in prison staff when it comes to interacting with inmates who have been shown to have a mental illness from one of punitive to medical assistance. Prison staff need to have more sufficient training in recognizing when inmates may be having an episode and how they can interact with them to lessen the gravity of the situation and help the inmate to become more compliant and obtain treatment. As previously stated a de-emphasis on punitive forms of treatment to establish compliance must be part of the equation as punishments such as isolation can only make symptoms of mental illness worse. Research has shown that isolation can increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and suicide in general for all inmates but especially those who have a mental illness ( Human Rights Watch, 2007) and is often thought to be a much cheaper way to deal with the mentally ill. There are numerous factors that need to work together in conjunction with one another to provide needed treatment to PWMI and these include such things as counseling, consultation, medication, and having a separate area where PWMI can be housed. These separate housing areas may include behavioral programs that can be suited to their individual needs. Correctional officers need to play a vital role in treatment for the mentally ill if compliance in behavior, including taking medication is to be expected. Correctional officers also need to work alongside psychologists who are treating these inmates so they may discuss and exchange information regarding mentally ill inmates in their care including risk of violence or other aggressive behavior. As far as minimizing cost, perhaps if these types of programs were implemented on a regular basis it might cut down costs dealing with injury, lawsuits for inadequate care or even death, and possible longer prison sentences"
119,"Hi Liisa, I also agree that due to prisons being understaffed and correctional officers being highly untrained it would be beneficial to bring a specialized group of correctional officers to receive training in dealing with people who have a mental illness. Having specified programs and housing directed towards the mentally ill may help them participate more effectively in their treatment. Having community treatment programs upon release can also cut down on the recidivism rate. I liked the idea of pre-trial diversion programs instead of prison. This will not only cut down on the prison population but it will better help those individuals with mental illness seek treatment and cut down on costs in general. Great post!"
120,"Hi Stephanie, I do agree with you that PWMI should definitely have separate housing units from the general population, however, I disagree with you in terms of the allocated resources. I felt inmates who have a mental illness should receive more resources due to the fact they have special medical needs compared to those of the general population. Many individuals in the general population know how to deal with the loud noises, chaotic scenes, and they understand and know how to comply with orders. For people with mental illness these loud noises, chaos, and lack of understanding of officer's commands can add stress and exacerbate symptoms. This in turn may lead to punitive measures like solitary confinement. Inmates who suffer from mental illness need to be under the care of staff who can evaluate their needs in terms of medications and programs and monitor their progress for eventual release. Thank you for a different perspective! Great post!"
121,"If my tax payer dollars were going towards a mental health facility that may actually improve the quality of life for those suffering from mental illness I would be highly supportive. The Fulton State hospital seems like it is trying to achieve a higher standard of care which involves patients being active in their own treatment. This kind of care can give patients a feeling of more independence and motivation to be more receptive to care. Fulton also plans on having group therapy sessions which helps patients to be in a more supportive environment and lessens feelings of hopelessness. A new facility is essential because some of the outdated facilities are ill-equipped to handle the large number of mentally ill individuals. These facilities often come across as cold, impersonal, and have a jail like feeling to them. Having a new facility that is inviting and can cater to the needs of PWMI will help break the cycle of reentry into the jail system and homelessness. Having a state of the art facility that will help prepare PWMI to be compliant with their medications and therapy so they could live out in the community is money well spent instead of spending tax payer dollars on short stays in the emergency rooms or jail."
122,"I would not consider the ""Not guilty by Reason of Insanity"" a ""Get out of Jail Free"" card because although those individuals who have been found not guilty by this standard are still confined to a mental hospital for what will most likely be the rest of their lives. As the video went over judges are not inclined to let a killer roam free in the community even if they are receiving the treatment they need due to the fact compliance with medications and treatment on the outside is not a guarantee. Even some inmates who are serving life sentences get the opportunity for parole. This mandated sentence in a psychiatric facility can be construed as a punishment just in a very different form. However, the sentence, in my opinion, is justified as violent behavior has already been displayed and the safety of the community should be at the forefront."
123,"The major concern appears to be staffing as stated in the video the nurses feel that they are often short staffed with no one to help them. I feel when it comes to dealing with PWMI who have a violent nature there should be two or more people when trying to deal with them. There also needs to be more security staff on hand in the event something does go wrong such as if a simple attempt to have a patient take their medications turns into an all out brawl. Training cooks and house keepers to deal with these types of dangerous situations is absurd as they are not nurses or even part of the medical staff. That type of care is not what they get paid to do or I am sure even agreed to do when they were hired. Even if basic training was provided to the rest of the staff, the nurse was correct when he stated that it is not the same as they do not have contact with this patients every day the way they do. They do not know what to expect or how they should handle these types of situations or the people themselves. This will only lead to more injuries for both staff and patients. State hospitals need more funding, more properly trained individuals (including training on what to do in crisis situations), and security staff on standby to be able to assist medical staff."
124,"In my personal opinion I do not feel that it is a terrible treatment. Doctors implant pacemakers to help keep the heart functioning in certain individuals who have cardiac issues. To me, this is no different as both groups are suffering just in different ways. To have to live in deep sadness and experience no joy in life is really more of a punishment than it is a life. If I were in the same position I would want to undergo this procedure even if the risks are considerable such as brain damage, infection, or even death. Having to try to live my life surrounded by family and friends and being unable to feel what they feel or being unable to share with them how I feel is worse than death. These doctors are trying to improve the quality of life for people who are suffering and with some of the success stories they have already had I definitely believe it is something worth researching further and investing more funding in. It is one step forward in successfully treating various types of mental illnesses."
125,"The appropriate role for state hospitals compared to that of the criminal justice system is one of a medical role. Individuals caught up in the criminal justice system face more of a punitive type of treatment in the jails and prisons. State hospitals, although at one time were also punitive in nature, are now more in line with a compassionate and therapeutic manner of treatment. State hospitals are more equipped to handle individuals with mental illness as that is their primary function. They are responsible for their daily care as well as ensuring that patients are compliant with medications and other forms of therapy. State hospitals can also a better job in diagnosing mental illness upon admission and in comparison to the noise, chaos, and violence of the jails and prisons can provide a quiet and more secure environment. The criminal justice system does not fully address the problems and needs of those suffering from mental health issues. Once PWMI enter into the criminal justice system and are imprisoned they are offered very little in terms of treatment. Officers have very little training on how to deal with people suffering from mental illness and the different types of illnesses and symptoms. Due to the fact jails and prisons are understaffed, especially in terms of the number of mental health professionals employed, it is difficult to create an individualized plan for inmates suffering from a mental illness. Inmates are treated for the span of time incarcerated and when released have no long term plan to follow. Those with mental illness often end up back out on the streets and eventually back into the criminal justice system. I believe state hospitals should be used almost exclusively for forensic patients. As seen in the lecture, forensic patients make up 90% of the Department of State Hospitals population. Forensic patients are patients who are committed by the criminal courts due to questions regarding competency to stand trial, unable to regain competency, and those individuals who were found not guilty by reason of insanity (Fisher, W., Geller, J., & Pandiani, J., 2009). However, I do believe there should be an expansion that would include sexually dangerous as well as difficult-to-discharge patients. These group of individuals pose a strong threat to themselves and society as a whole. State hospitals are more designed to address their psychiatric needs instead of the overcrowded jails or prisons where they run the risk of spiraling o"
126,"Hi Serenity, I felt differently with regards to the issue of state hospitals being used for forensic patients. I feel they should be used almost exclusively for forensic patients and I say almost exclusively because I feel that state hospitals should expand to include sexually dangerous and difficult to discharge patients as prisons and jails are not the proper place for them either. These groups of people pose a threat to themselves and society as a whole however they are still in need of psychiatric treatment that only a state hospital can provide. Forensic patients show no signs of becoming the minority in state hospitals and seem to be the ones in need of round the clock care. Thank you for a different outlook regarding this issue. Great post."
127,"Hi Liisa, although I differ with you regrading state hospitals and their use for forensic patients I do appreciate the fact you brought up a point about implementing new policies regarding medications, therapy and programs designed to educate people who have been found incompetent to stand trial on their offense as well as legal processes including roles in a court of law. My thoughts were that state hospitals should be used ""almost"" exclusively for forensic patients there should be an expansion for those who are sexually dangerous as well as those who are difficult to discharge as I believe they too would benefit from round the clock care and have very little chance of being released back into the community. Tahnk you for your ideas. Great post."
128,"I believe the forms of data sharing are not satisfactory for really understanding the link between criminal justice and the mental health systems. While I understand the HIPPA laws in reference to mental health, limiting access to mental health databases will not provide an accurate picture of what the individual's needs really are and what has worked and what has not.  As far as those in criminal justice coming up with ways to obtain the rights from patients to divulge health related information that might be equally as hard as many individuals might not trust law enforcement to begin with or what they are being asked to sign. I think those in criminal justice should be allowed access to mental health databases so they can understand what type of illness they are dealing with, what treatment may be needed, and anything that may have exacerbated the symptoms like illegal narcotics. However, I do not believe those in criminal justice should be allowed to use this type of information against them. When it comes to obtaining information for medical treatment their should be an exclusionary rule.  "
129,"The CIT trained approach is less volatile in nature and more empathetic. The officers in the video spoke calmly to the person in distress and with a degree of patience. They asked a variety of questions to try and find out what the source of his agitation was and tried to reassure him that help was available and could be provided for him. The officers also tried to find out what he ingested and how much to make sure he received the proper medical aid. The officers took a substantial amount of time with the individual and were reassuring in nature as they did not push him or become annoyed  at lack of compliance in the beginning. With a routine law enforcement encounter there is more of a command presence with orders being given in a less than calm voice. Depending on the call, the person may be patted down then cuffed and his statement may be taken from there as to what may have transpired. In a routine call, medical services would be provided if needed and it is doubtful that a crisis intervention team would be called if the officers are unsure if the individual has a mental illness or not. Main point is the officers in the video were on the offensive whereas in routine law enforcement encounters they are typically on the defensive."
130,"I believe a majority of the time they just do not see the difference between inmates who have a mental illness  and those inmates who do not. I say that because I believe some correction officers do not look at PWMI in the jails or prisons as those who have special medical needs but as problematic inmates. Perhaps some of the jail or prison staff do not even realize that the inmate has a diagnosed mental illness, maybe they have very little training due to budget restrictions, or quite frankly, maybe they are just too overwhelmed to deal with the population as a whole especially the needs of those with a mental illness. Correctional departments will just continue to operate this way for as long as they can until they are legally forced to re-examine their procedures and find money in already scarce budgets to implement new forms of training and protocols. I do not believe it is because they are implementing their own version of care or what they feel it should be. I believe correction officers just do not have the training, staff, or means to effectively deal with inmates who have a mental illness."
131,"Some of the challenges I can foresee happening in a correctional environment for mental health workers is gaining trust from those with mental illness. It would be very hard to treat those suffering from a mental illness when they are closed off and unwilling to accept treatment. This type of attitude may be partially due to the environment they are surrounded by. The correctional facilities are often loud and violent with officers giving commands and expecting quick compliance. Mental health workers need to be convincing to gain the trust of PWMI and show that they are there not to extend any type of punitive treatment but to try and help them in a therapeutic sense. Mental health workers may also find there is a barrier between them and the correctional officers in terms of information exchanged and treatment. The way some correctional officers may be treating inmates with mental illnesses may be in direct conflict with the therapeutic treatment  they are receiving by mental health workers.  I think cross training with correctional agencies and staff would give mental health workers a better understanding of what correctional officers face, how correctional departments function, and it may be used as an opportunity to get to know the correctional staff and offer suggestions on what correctional officers could do to better interact with inmates with mental illness. "
132,"When it comes to those in the criminal justice field I feel it is necessary for them to have the type of training that will help them to understand that the individual they are encountering may have a mental illness and is in distress. This can be done by providing training to police officers by mental health professionals on the various types of mental illness, the types of behaviors that may be displayed, as well as the potential side effects of some of the prescribed medications. Police officers should be trained how to interact with PWMI and how to de-escalate a situation so force will not always be a go to method in controlling the situation. Police officers should also be provided with the knowledge of where counseling centers are in their communities so they can refer those individuals who are not in a crisis situation for help instead of booking them in the jail or placing them on a 5150 hold. Police officers also need to be informed  where they can take PWMI for emergency evaluations for immediate help. Simulation training is essential in my opinion as it would give law enforcement personnel the ability to put their newfound knowledge into action. If possible, a specialized team should be assembled to specifically deal with PWMI and mental health calls. These officers would have extensive training on how to interact with and control these types of situations. Dispatchers need to be trained on how to screen calls to recognize when it is a mental health situation and dispatch the appropriate trained personnel. Correctional officers would also benefit from not only academic training on mental illness but interactive training as well. This would include how mental illness affects individuals, what they are feeling, and what factors may exacerbate symptoms. Correctional officers should also learn what they can do in an already chaotic environment to alleviate some of the symptoms of mental illness including different available treatments. Mental health professionals need to be aware of the mindsets of law enforcement and court personnel. They have an obligation to the safety of the community first and based on this it may be beneficial for mental health professionals to learn about the criminal justice process and procedures including information that gets shared. Mental health professionals also need to know what law enforcement expects from them when responding to a mental health situation so boundaries are set. It is also important for mental hea"
133,"Hi Danielle, I actually thought that the CIT model was a great way to benefit PWMI. Although there has not been enough research done which would explicitly endorse this type of model, I feel the positive results that are already being obtained is reason enough to incorporate this type of training more.  This reasoning also stems from the fact there really have been no other type of training prototypes introduced since the development of the CIT model only variations. I believe it something that can be built on but definitely not an overall solution. However, in my opinion the 10 hours of training is not nearly enough time for police officers to be trained. Police officers spend more hours overall in the shooting range and in writing reports and due to the fact police officers are encountering PWMI regularly more hours of training need to be implemented. Thank you for your perspective!"
134,"Hello Viviana, I also expressed that crisis intervention training should be mandatory for all officers but that a special team should be established who have had extensive training. My thought behind this was that the responding officer may not be a part of the CIT team but may need to control the situation until a member or members from the team arrive. Collaboration is also essential because police officers need to have the proper training from those who already work in the field. This type of training includes how to interact with PWMI, signs and symptoms of different mental illness, and types of treatment available. Police officers and mental health professionals need to be able to share information and express their concerns. This will help in addressing problems with training, field interactions, and expectations police officers may have regarding mental health professionals and vice versa. Great post!"
135,"I believe diversion efforts focus on the non-violent offender due to the fact PWMI who are non-violent are easier to work with in terms of establishing a relationship with during a mental crisis encounter. These non-violent offenders are also most likely to embrace a more stable and sustainable treatment making it easier to divert them into a treatment program and prevent them from being recycled into the criminal justice system. I believe diversion efforts also focus on the non-violent offender because as we have learned in the past the majority of PWMI are non-violent and are in need of treatment services not correctional services which stand to only exacerbate the situation. Violent offenders also need treatment but at a much different level. I believe violent offenders need to be incarcerated in a state hospital where they can receive intensive treatment by highly trained professionals. Releasing these types of offenders into the community only poses a threat to public safety, public safety officers, and to the offender with mental illness. "
136,"I think hurdles are different for criminal justice and mental health agencies when implementing evidence-based practices. First of all, criminal justice agencies and mental health agencies have very different perspectives. Criminal justice agencies hurdles in implementing evidence-based practices is getting approval from administration like the sheriff or chief then from county or city council and convincing them of the research. They also have the option of implementing these new practices on their own to see the outcome for themselves and tailoring certain aspects of it as they go along to best suit the department's needs. For mental health agencies, before implementing evidence-based practices they have to be sure these practices have been researched and that they have been verified and approved by numerous professional agencies. While both agencies face hurdles when it comes to implementing practices, I believe mental health agencies have the extra hurdle of making sure that everything has been verified on a researched based level with little room for error and little change in structure."
137,I think if integrated models such as the ones seen in the video were promoted on a national level there would be a drop in the number of PWMI recycled through the criminal justice system. I believe the justice system would refer more PWMI into programs like these instead of handing down sentences which incarcerate PWMI in jails and prisons much longer than their counterparts who do not suffer from mental illness yet committed the same crime. The justice system could now be a part of the solution to help more PWMI receive the proper treatment that criminal justice institutions cannot and are not trained to provide especially when it comes to co-occurring disorders such as mental illness and substance abuse. 
138,"Peer mentoring might help with the stigma associated with mental illness by letting those affected with mental illness know they are not alone and it does not mean they cannot have a fulfilling life. Peer mentoring can give others hope and encouragement to become active and productive members of society instead of hiding for fear of what others may say or think. In the video, one of the mentees was excited to start a new class that her mentor had encouraged her to take as a way to make new friends. As more PWMI come to terms with their illness and feel confident about who they are and sharing their story there is the possibility that other members of society will come to realize the truths about mental illness including the fact that mental illness and the individuals diagnosed with them are nothing to be feared or shunned."
139,"Timothy Souder’s death while in prison was both tragic and disturbing, and certain measures could have been taken in order to prevent him from dying in such a horrific manner. First and foremost, the prison should have had multiple psychiatrists in the facility at any given time in case a crisis like Timothy’s happened to take place. If a psychiatrist was present during Timothy’s ordeal, he could have been removed from solitary confinement, enabling him to receive the appropriate medical treatment he so desperately needed. Aside from mandating that a psychiatrist consistently be stationed within the prison, the facility should consider hiring additional staff in order to ensure that essential or critical paperwork with respect to inmates is completed in a timely manner. For instance, in the video it was mentioned that a social worker wanted to have Timothy transferred to a hospital, yet this process was delayed because the paperwork was never completed. Situations like this should never occur, especially when someone’s life is in jeopardy and he or she requires immediate medical attention. Besides hiring more prison personnel, I also believe that drastic changes need to be made concerning current prison policies in order to better serve mentally ill inmates like Timothy. For instance, solitary confinement should be restricted to a certain number of hours given that isolation for long periods of time is completely detrimental to one’s emotional and physical well-being. Placing individuals who are already at risk in an isolated cell only exacerbates problems for them. For example, an individual with severe anxiety or depression could become more suicidal when placed in isolation. Nevertheless, in addition to changing policies with respect to solitary confinement, I also feel that the concept of placing inmates in “punitive restraints” needs to be altered as well. Having individuals like Timothy in restraints (i.e. chains/ shackles) in a cell serves no beneficial purpose. In essence, being alone and isolated is punishment enough, but to go a step further and have someone bound just seems cruel and unnecessary. Furthermore, the prison’s conditions and practices are also incredibly problematic. For example, Timothy’s isolation cell was exceptionally hot, and this could have aided in his rapid deterioration. It was also reported that Timothy refused to drink water at certain times, and this should have been a serious cause for concern by both staff and medica"
140,"Non-medical considerations for treatment of persons with mental illness (PWMI) really emerged during the Renaissance and the pre-civil war era. The Renaissance brought about the philosophy of humanism, in which former tactics involving the torture and execution of mentally ill individuals were abandoned for better alternatives. Subsequently, during the pre-civil war period (1800s and 1900s), individuals and advocates like Dorothea Dix fought hard to advance the plight of patients in insane asylums in the United States. Essentially, the new objective was to provide mentally ill individuals with appropriate care by simply treating them in a more humane manner unlike had been done in the past. For instance, in the Middle Ages, people that were committed and confined in asylums were physically abused (i.e. restrained, chained, beaten) and treated no better than “animals.” To add to this, female patients were even brutally force-fed against their will and sexually abused by male attendees who had easy access to their rooms. Although treatment of PWMI was cruel and exceptionally harsh for hundreds of years, practices eventually improved over time as new psychiatric hospitals emerged and reforms called for more civil treatment involving gentility and kindness rather than punishment. However, as we progress in the 21 stcentury these psychiatric institutions which afforded patients with improved care have been closing at an alarming rate all over the country. Today, many mentally ill patients are either living homeless on the streets or being criminalized and recycled in the criminal justice system due to lack of available mental health facilities.  "
141,"In order to answer this question, I think you have to consider the benefits versus the costs of having a national registry consisting of mentally ill persons. The only real benefit would be reducing gun violence by limiting persons with mental illness from possessing guns and potentially shooting people. The costs on the other hand of a national registry would include further stigmatization, additional emotional and physical distress (i.e. embarrassment and inner turmoil from being placed on a registry), and restriction of government granted rights (i.e. the constitutional right to own a firearm). Therefore, I personally do not think the benefits of a registry including PWMI outweigh the costs to these particular individuals as well as society. Moreover, it is important to note that most PWMI do not commit violent acts. In fact, mentally ill persons are more likely to harm themselves (i.e. attempt suicide) than others when it comes to firearms. Thus, I think the media, certain political parties, and lay persons in general should not only stop using PWMI as scapegoats for the mass shooting epidemic in America, but also requiring them to be listed in national registries such as California’s Armed Prohibited Persons System (APPS). Specifically targeting and mandating PWMI to register is both discriminatory and unjust considering the lack of evidence indicating these individuals are violent and deadly. Finally, I believe that the focus regarding gun violence should shift away from policies concerning PWMI and instead be directed at limiting access to firearms for everyone in society as well as banning certain forms of weapons (i.e. assault rifles).   "
142,"In my opinion, I think that the lack of promised community based mental health clinics for PWMI has led to today’s crisis involving mentally ill persons and the criminal justice system. As a result of deinstitutionalization in the United States, individuals who were “sick” and in need of care were suddenly being removed from state hospitals and forced to reside in the streets without any form of treatment. Thus, I believe that the most significant problem to address and resolve with respect to PWMI is nonexistent facilities for people suffering with mental illness. The federal government as well as state and local agencies need to implement a substantial amount of mental health institutions across America that provide appropriate care for PWMI. If we have more facilities, this in turn allows more people to be treated and less individuals to come into contact with law enforcement personnel such as police officers. As we have learned, encounters with the police often lead to PWMI being prosecuted for minor offenses (i.e. misdemeanors), and their subsequent incarceration then leads to a host of other problems such as a criminal record, inability to find employment and housing, stigmatization, etc. Therefore, we need to limit the number of interactions between law enforcement agencies and those experiencing mental illness, and one way to achieve this is by having more beds available in mental health hospitals/clinics and getting PWMI the treatment they so desperately need."
143,"Mental illness has been prevalent throughout history, and the way in which society has viewed persons with mental illness (PWMI) has changed as time has progressed. When it comes to PWMI, there are several particular time periods that were significant in terms of treatment of the mentally ill: pre-civilization, ancient civilizations, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Age of Enlightenment, pre-civil war, and the beginning of deinstitutionalization. During each of these eras, the perception of mental illness influenced how others felt about individuals suffering from mental disorders and their level of autonomy, self-determination, and belongingness. Nevertheless, the broad picture reveals that PWMI went from being stigmatized, abandoned, tortured, and even killed, to being acknowledged and receiving more humane treatment for disorders that had underlying causes. Even though the treatment of PWMI has drastically improved since preceding centuries, society still has a long way to go in caring for mentally ill persons in need of care.             In the pre-civilization era or what is considered the “Stone Age,” there was absolutely no knowledge of what is known today as “mental illness” or any of its related disorders (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, etc.) (Turner, 2019, Lecture 1-1). Therefore, ancient tribes who looked after PWMI reasoned that severe and abnormal behaviors were due to so-called “evil spirits” (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013, p. 20). It was reported that members of clans even resorted to removing parts of an individual’s skull to drain the spirits (i.e. trephination). Nevertheless, if the tribe was unable to care for these “troublesome” persons, they were abandoned and left to fend for themselves. That being said, it seems as though these early communities were exceptionally callous due to their unwillingness to allow PWMI to reside alongside others who were “normal.” Ancient civilizations (Greeks and Romans) on the other hand, became much more knowledgeable about mental illness in comparison to those in the pre-civilization era. Philosophers such as Plato and Hippocrates discovered that the root of mental illness stemmed from the brain (Slate et al., 2013, p. 20). Yet despite this accurate information, certain philosophers felt that mental illness was due to bodily imbalances (i.e. phlegm, bile) and that individuals could be cured through “cleansing.” Regardless of this incorrect assumption, people in ancient"
144,"Hi Jennifer!  I really enjoyed reading your post and we had many of the same exact sentiments. I also stated that PWMI are not considered as ""full-fledged"" members of society because we continue to stigmatize mental illness to this day. Although it is true that there are those who are compassionate towards individuals with mental illness who are suffering, others unfortunately believe that mentally ill people are ""frightening, dangerous, and violent.""  This misconception is also still fueled by the media/news as well as those with political agendas like the National Rifle Association (NRA). After watching the Youtube video for this week ""The Truth About Mental Illness,""  I was shocked that spokespersons for this organization are intentionally trying to cast blame on PWMI for America's mass shooting epidemic. It was cringeworthy considering that the issue stems from having lax gun policies and insufficient background checks. Ironically, what the NRA does not realize is that placing guns in the hands of mentally ill patients is more likely to do harm to them than result in the death of others. Thus, I wholeheartedly agree with you that education will go a long way in informing society that PWMI are not as dangerous and violent as people are led on to believe. Additionally, I think that another issue is the way we have framed mental illness and the terminology we use when discussing it. For instance, the word ""mental"" is another way to say ""crazy."" Simply adding ""illness"" to it, makes it seem like a ""crazy disease."" When I hear mental illness, I know that it refers to someone suffering from a mental disorder (i.e. anxiety, depression, etc.), yet despite this knowledge, the words ""mental illness"" still have a negative connotation attached to it. We should have never used this type of terminology, but instead referred to an individual with anxiety as merely an anxious person. However, we first like to say that he/she has a ""mental illness,"" and more specifically, he/she has ""anxiety."" Again, I simply feel that the wording we use it detrimental, however, I am not sure what wording would have been used otherwise in preceding centuries/decades. People thought of ""mental illness"" as disease of the brain/mind, so this is what it was referred to throughout history and even today.  Great discussion Jennifer! "
145,"Hi Alyse!  Great post! I like how you specifically highlighted the ""ancient civilizations era"" which discussed the Greeks and the Romans. After reviewing the different time periods, it did seem as though this era was the most humane in terms of treatment for PWMI. They were the only era in which mentally ill persons were not cast out of society and their treatment was actually civil (i.e. comfortable and sanitary settings with proper lighting). Yet after this time period, it seemed that humane treatment oscillated back and forth but it was never exceptional or great. For instance, people in the Middle Ages merely tortured and executed persons who were mentally ill or non-conformists, but once you fast-forward to the pre-civil war era, individuals like Dorothea Dix were influencing legislators and opening new mental hospitals across the United States. However, these hospitals/institutions were infamous for being overcrowded, understaffed, and neglecting and abusing scores of patients. Eventually wit the progression of time, we moved towards deinstitutionalization which presents a host of other issues (i.e. lack of treatment, homelessness).  Great post! "
146,"A president can attempt to bring about an end to stigma associated with mental illness by becoming more educated about mental illness and informing the public of its prevalence, adverse effects on individuals, and available treatment options. Furthermore, the president  could budget for and allocate money annually to build new mental health facilities for persons suffering with mental illness. Continuous implementation could really go a long way in providing more and more inpatient beds for psychiatric patients who are unable to receive treatment.  Perhaps the president should even go as far as ensuring that a certain number of facilities are being created or that a quota is being reached. Aside from building mental health clinics, the president could also create more housing structures for PWMI. As we learned from the previous lecture, many PWMI are living homeless on the streets due to the deinstitutionalization movement. Thus, providing them with cheap and affordable housing or even rent-free housing (for a period of time or indefinitely) would help to at least produce a safe and secure residence so that they are not further victimized in unsafe environments (i.e. crime-ridden neighborhoods and streets). Finally, another option, albeit somewhat drastic, could be for the president to have a day that nationally recognizes mental illness. It could be called ""mental illness awareness day"" and there could be incentives for people to go out and donate on that particular day to aid PWMI and their ongoing plight. Such measures would keep people better informed and mental illness and also bring about more compassion for PWMI. "
147,"The movement towards reducing benefits for mental health care indicates that policy makers do not support PWMI (adults and children) in the same manner they support patients with other types of medical conditions (i.e. cancer). In other words, mental disorders are less deserving of attention and care in comparison to progressive, invasive, and life-threatening diseases or illnesses. While it is apparent that medical conditions can be quite serious and even fatal, this does not detract from the fact that mentally ill persons are also suffering considerably. Severe and persistent mental illness can be extremely debilitating, both emotionally and physically, to the point that the disorder(s) renders individuals unable to carry on from day to day. That being said, mental illness (albeit a cognitive disorder) should be looked at like any other disease, or at least have comparable significance. As we saw from the Youtube video ""In Crisis, Out of Room,"" psychotic episodes could become more and more dangerous without treatment. For instance, the video segment showed a desperate mother attempting to calm down her young son who was screaming that he wanted to kill himself. Such an incidence has the propensity to take a dark turn should her son actually try to commit suicide. Nonetheless, situations such as these are all-too-common considering that thousands of PWMI are not receiving the health care treatment they need because hospitals and emergency rooms have no inpatient beds. Thus, the fact that policy makers are continuing to cut various mental health services despite this existing problem, reveals that they deem the mental health care system as well as PWMI as being ""unworthy"" of assistance and funding. "
148,"After viewing the video about service members' experiences with medication for mental illness while in the military, I would recommend psychiatric or psychological counseling as well as group therapy before prescribing medication to active members and veterans. Group therapy might bring about belongingness for service members who are struggling with mental and physical distress, but have no one to share their experiences. Moreover, this type of ""talk therapy"" is a great way for current and former military personnel to discuss sensitive topics without feeling judged or embarrassed. On the other hand, independent counseling with a psychiatrist could better inform soldiers if they have an actual diagnosable mental disorder that needs treatment. It could very well be the case that many service members are experiencing adverse symptoms without recognizing that that they are mentally ill. Thus, I feel that any form of counseling is a better alternative than simply resorting to medicating soldiers and providing them with psychiatric drugs that could actually exacerbate their issues. Medications should only be given when other modalities have produced insufficient results or when other means of treatment work best in combination with drugs. "
149,"This is a really difficult question to answer, but for the most part I do not believe that society should be allowed to interfere in a person's life and mandate that he/she receive psychiatric treatment. Allowing family members, associates, the police, or society to ""step in"" when they feel that someone may need or could benefit from treatment infringes upon individual's rights. Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge that behavior that seems abnormal or frightening to one person could be normal to another (i.e. the person exhibiting the behavior or a random person). Therefore, we need to be exercise caution in attempting to involuntarily commit an individual to a psychiatric hospital/facility, because doing so could have adverse effects on the person admitted. He or she essentially is constricted in an institution for a period of time (i.e. 5150 mandates 72 hour observation period) where they experience a loss of freedom, and even embarrassment or psychological distress. Additionally, the person may be unable to work or attend to their regular daily activities which causes added turmoil. Therefore, I think that society should avoid mandating treatment for persons who may not be aware that they are mentally ill unless the individual is a danger to themselves or others (i.e. grave disability). Nevertheless, when individuals are deemed to be ""dangerous"" in some capacity, there are already existing laws in place which allow for their involuntary civil commitment. Thus, when neither of these scenarios exists, other persons should not have power or discretion over treatment decisions for persons who may or may not exhibit mental illness.  "
150,"Tackling and overcoming the stigma associated with mental illness is an incredibly difficult task. Unfortunately, there is an obstinate negative perception of mental illness, and most individuals choose to distance themselves from PWMI because of the erroneous belief that they are dangerous and violent (Turner, 2019, Lesson 2-3). Besides fearing people suffering from mental disorders, there are others who look down upon PWMI because they feel that these individuals contribute to their own plight (i.e. weak moral character) (Turner, 2019, Lesson 2-2). Finally, aside from everyone that harbors negative attitudes and beliefs about PWMI, there are also people who create and enforce legislation which serves to inhibit their civil rights. Nevertheless, in order to end mistreatment of PWMI and to reduce the various forms of stigma that affect this group, we need to educate members of the public. By specifically involving youth (elementary, middle school, and high school students) in the discussion of mental illness, we are educating and informing younger generations, while also preparing them to deal effectively with PWMI as they mature into adults.             Elementary curriculum should address public stigma and self-stigma that impacts PWMI, whereas middle school and high school curriculum should also include structural stigma. Elementary school students may be less capable of understanding the facts and statistics in relation to PWMI, therefore it might be better to give this group definitions and simplified examples of stigma, and how it relates to mental illness. On the other hand, middle school and high school students are more capable of listening to and processing information in a way that resonates with them. Therefore, when teaching middle school and high school students, it would be best to discuss the three predominant stigmas (public, structural, self-stigma) and how to go about each of them in order to help people experiencing mental illness. First and foremost, educators could bring up public stigma, and how misconceptions and portrayals of PWMI leads to isolation and poor treatment. For instance, PWMI are deemed as violent “homicidal maniacs” who are capable of anything, when in reality, “most people with mental illness will never commit an act of violence” (Rusch, Angermeyer, & Corrigan, 2005, p. 530; Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013, p. 75). To add to this, “when [PWMI partake in violence], most do not target strang"
151,"Hi Denise!  Awesome post! You brought up some great ideas with how to approach the topic of mental illness and stigma as far as elementary and high school students. Given that elementary students are young and their cognitive and psychosocial skills are still underdeveloped, this age group may exhibit difficulties in understanding what mental illness is (mental disorders), how it affects people (various symptoms), and what can be done about it (treatment options) in order to reduce stigma. Thus, middle school and high schools students may be better target groups as far as discussing stigma in relation to mental illness. Your idea to bring in a speaker who has suffered from mental illness could really benefit students because it gives them a first-hand account of how to recognize adverse symptoms and how to go about seeking treatment. As we learned this week, many people do not even recognize that they have a mental disorder or they fail to realize that their symptoms actually require treatment (i.e. anosognosia) (Turner, 2019, Lesson 2-4). Nevertheless, I remember when I was a senior in high school, we had a guest speaker (young female student) who came into our classroom to speak about underage drinking and drunk driving, and how a drunk driving incident had negatively impacted her life. To this day, I remember this girl that came in and had spoken to our class, and her speech was effective in the sense that it stuck with me until today. Thus, not only is having a speaker a great option in terms of educating students about mental illness and stigma, but perhaps having an actual student that is similar to them  would really get students to listen. "
152,"Hey Stephanie!  Great post! You brought up some interesting examples and good ideas to implement. I particularly like your idea to teach middle school students about mental health. Most, if not all students, are required to take a ""health"" class in middle school or high school. Thus, it would make sense to also incorporate a ""mental health"" class given how disorders such as anxiety and depression are increasing among school-aged children and adolescents. Students could really benefit from such a course, and I am actually surprised that this hasn't already taken place. However, certain schools may have a lack funding as it is, and probably wouldn't be able to add such classes to students' curriculum. Aside from middle school students, high school student could certainly benefit from outside speakers, however, I am not sure whether school administrators would be on board for ""mental health days"" for students considering that students typically leave school when they are sick or feeling ill. In addition, there are school psychologists and counselors available to meet and speak with students experiencing problems. Nonetheless, while having a day off for mental health purposes is not a bad idea and could benefit some individuals, students would be missing classes and potentially falling behind which may exacerbate their condition. "
153,"Both sensitivity and specificity apply to civil commitment, albeit in a different way. In terms of civil commitment, sensitivity would be civilly committing individuals (treating patients in inpatient or outpatient settings) who do have some kind of mental health issue (i.e. true positive). On the other hand, specificity is when individuals are not civilly committed because they do have a mental health issue (i.e. true negative). Both of these scenarios are considered ""good"" or positive because people who either have or do not have mental health issues are not being harmed in any way. Essentially, those who need treatment are getting it, while those who do not have mental illnesses/disorders are not being wrongfully targeted and committed into mental health facilities. Aside from these real world situations, there are two circumstances that do present an issue for individuals. For instance, a person could be civilly committed when they do not have an actual mental health issue (i.e. false positive). From my perspective this situation is incredibly problematic because an individual ends up losing his/her freedom for the amount of time they are hospitalized and evaluated. Furthermore, potentially medicating and treating someone who does not have a mental health condition could end up in a civil law suit against the facility. Nevertheless, another troubling scenario would be an individual who has a mental illness/disorder, but who is not civilly committed for some reason or another (i.e. false negative). We learned these instances are the ones that produce public outcry, and this may be due to the fact that a large number of mentally ill persons are going untreated because of issues related to lack of state hospitals/community-based mental health clinics, homelessness, inability to pay for treatment services, etc. Thus, PWMI are getting worse both mentally and physically, and society will have to deal with a population that is getting both sicker and larger. "
154,"Truthfully, I am torn with respect to this question because I think that involuntary civil commitment is both a good as well as bad idea when it comes to sexually violent predators (SVPs). On one hand, I do think that there are some SVPs that pose a significant threat to others even after serving prison time. These particularly dangerous offenders should be civilly committed in an institution and locked up indefinitely, because they have the propensity to shatter people's lives once again upon release. In essence, there is nothing wrong with society erring on the side of caution and being safe rather than sorry should a sexual crime take place once an offender is released from custody. Nevertheless, while proponents of SVP statutes contend that involuntary civil commitment is necessary to protect society, opponents of such measures argue that these laws are unconstitutional and constitute double-jeopardy. For example, certain offenders who have committed sexual offenses complete their prison sentence, and then go on to serve additional time in a state mental hospital/psychiatric facility (i.e. Coalinga in CA). In other words, they are being punished all over again for the same offense, albeit in a different way. Moreover, some SVPs remain in these state hospitals indefinitely because they are forever deemed as ""dangerous"" by evaluating psychologists/psychiatrists. In reality, there is often no way for them to contest their involuntary civil commitment or do anything about their plight. Aside from being issues with being detained after having served their time, I find fault with certain instruments such as the Psychopathy Checklist Revised (PCL-R), which are used in involuntary civil commitment decisions. This particular test signifies whether an offender is a ""psychopath"" based upon a cutoff score, and anyone identified as a psychopath is highly likely to be civilly committed. Therefore, I think that this test could produce unfair results, depending on the evaluator's subjective opinion as well as past transgressions that may or may not be relevant to whether a person will commit future sexual crimes. That being said, attempting to predict future behavior is an incredibly difficult task and doing so could prove to be wrong. "
155,"I personally feel that inpatient commitment enables the state to infringe on individual's rights more so than outpatient commitment. Although both forms of commitment require treatment compliance in some capacity, there seems to more controversy over inpatient commitment procedures. For instance, inpatient civil commitment necessitates hospitalization of PWMI for some duration of time. For persons who are involuntarily committed against their will, the evaluation period produces uncertainty and anguish. Moreover, patients can even be medicated after the initial 72-hour observation period has ended, and the treating psychiatrist deems further hospitalization is necessary. Nevertheless, although commitment hearings can provide procedural safeguards for individuals, attorneys and judges will often base their decisions upon the psychiatrist's recommendation; thus, creating an adversarial process. Aside from certain safeguards being ineffective, many people also believe that inpatient civil commitment is stigmatizing and discriminatory. Not only do people have a perception that PWMI in general are dangerous and violent, but black individuals who are committed to state hospitals receive more severe diagnoses and harsh treatment (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013, p. 123-124). It has been reported that black adolescents as well as adults were placed in restraints four times more often than their white counterparts. That being said,  racial discrepancies as far as psychiatric treatment is only one of the many issues with inpatient civil commitment. Besides problems stemming from inpatient care, outpatient civil commitment is also seen as coercive to some degree. Patients receiving outpatient care do so in the community, which is less restrictive from many peoples' perspectives (i.e. PWMI can still reside at home and carry out daily tasks instead of being locked up in a mental health facility). However, PWMI have to comply with medication instructions by psychiatrists, which is looked at as being a forceful tactic by the medical and legal community in order to gain compliance. Despite this notion, supporters of outpatient civil commitment contend that it increases medication and treatment compliance (i.e. positives) as well as quality of life after intervention (Turner, 2019, Lesson 3-3). Nevertheless, it appears that outpatient commitment allows PWMI to continue with their daily lives as long as they adhere to treatment conditions, whereas inpatient"
156,"Inpatient and outpatient commitment are different forms of civil commitment, which serve to protect persons with mental illness (PWMI) from harming themselves or others (members of the public) by providing them with psychiatric treatment (Turner, 2019, Lesson 3-1). Civil commitment operates under the  parens patriae doctrine, which allows the state (i.e. the court, police officers, etc.) to act as a guardian for mentally ill individuals who present some kind of “danger” (i.e. threaten or physically harm others; threaten or attempt to commit suicide) or are gravely disabled (i.e. cannot provide food, clothing, shelter for oneself) (Turner, 2019, Lesson 3-2). Nonetheless, involuntary inpatient and outpatient commitment provide treatment for PWMI, albeit in different ways. While inpatient commitment requires hospitalization of PWMI, outpatient commitment allows these individuals to receive psychiatric care while they are in the community (Turner, 2019, Lesson 3-3). Nevertheless, both of these types of civil commitment have benefits and drawbacks.             Inpatient civil commitment, regardless of whether it is involuntary, is said to be beneficial for PWMI because hospitalization provides them with treatment they may otherwise not receive. For instance, an individual with a severe mental disorder such as schizophrenia may be seeing or hearing things which causes him or her to act out violently towards others. More specifically, the textbook mentions the infamous case of Andrew Goldstein who killed Kendra Webdale on January 3, 1999 by pushing her onto an oncoming subway train (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013, p. 165-166). During the time Goldstein killed Webdale, he claimed that he was not in control of himself and he felt as though he was being “inhabited” by something, which ultimately led to him pushing Webdale. Moreover, it was discovered that Goldstein had consistently sought psychiatric treatment, but he was turned away countless times. In the weeks before Webdale’s tragic accident, Goldstein had been released prematurely from the hospital he had been admitted into and told to go seek counseling at a community mental health facility. That being said, individuals like Andrew Goldstein could benefit from involuntary civil commitment because, “[they are afforded with intensive] “24-hour care and supervision” (p. 115).  Aside from being institutionalized as a result of having a severe mental illness, another benefit of inp"
157,"Hi Jennifer!  Great response! I like how you stated that both inpatient and outpatient commitment are ""coercive by nature"" even though the goal of each is to provide treatment for PWMI. More often than not, the average layperson may believe that any type of mental health treatment, whether it requires hospitalization or mandated community treatment, only serves to benefit individuals, however, many people fail to take into account that such treatment infringes on the rights of individuals. In essence, a person can be civilly committed based upon meeting two criteria: having a diagnosable mental ill and being ""dangerous"" (to themselves or others) in some capacity (Turner, 2019, Lesson 3-2). From my viewpoint this criteria is not incredibly restrictive, and unfortunately there are situations in which persons who are not mentally ill will be involuntarily committed against their will even though they may not be a threat, or even have a severe mental illness for that matter (i.e. false positive) (Turner, 2019, Lesson 3-1). Even though there are individuals who receive treatment but that do not need it, hospitals typically tend to house the most severely mentally ill persons given the very small number of psychiatric beds available across the nation. Nonetheless, while I agree with you that there are PWMI who are certainly in need of inpatient commitment, I am not sure whether outpatient commitment is necessarily more effective given the data that is available. For instance, the text explicitly states that, ""there has been little research to test the effectiveness of OC"" (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013, p. 148). Moreover, the text states that outpatient commitment only produces benefits when it is intensive and extended (p. 149). Although the effectiveness of outpatient commitment varies, there is also intensive outpatient commitment which operates in between inpatient and outpatient commitment (Turner, 2019, Lesson 3-3). This form of treatment involves group therapy as well as medication management which may prove beneficial for PWMI. Given the different commitment types and in between treatment options, it is just seems that there are so many questions surrounding civil commitment procedures and its overall effectiveness. For example: 1. Is it better to have someone undergo hospitalization (inpatient commitment) or would outpatient commitment be better? Do some persons require both?  2. How long should involuntary com"
158,"I think that the most difficult stage of the criminal process for PWMI to navigate would be the ""adjudication"" process. Although I think that the ""prosecution & pretrial services"" stage may also be fairly problematic for PWMI, this stage mostly deals with prosecutors and judges making decisions until arraignment. For instance, the prosecutor will determine whether to file charges, while the judge will either indict or release the accused individual. If the person being accused is indicted, then he or she will plead guilty, not guilty, or no contest. Thus, I think that PWMI are capable of making this decision if they either did or did not commit the crime in question, however, I do think that at this particular stage, PWMI may not truly understand what a guilty plea entails (no trial, later sentencing, criminal record) versus a not guilty plea (upcoming trial with two possible outcomes: person can be found guilty and subsequently sentenced, person will have a criminal record; or person can be found not guilty and released with no criminal record). Nevertheless, while the ""prosecution & pretrial services"" stage is complicated and could be confusing, I still feel that the ""adjudication"" process is more complex because it specifically involves plea bargaining. Plea bargaining involves a range of outcomes that defendants have to make sense of such as pleading guilty to a lesser charge, removal of a charge(s), adhering to the prosecutor's personal recommendations for punishment, amongst others. This process can be very difficult for defendants who are suffering from mental illness and who may not have the capacity (due to their illness) to understand how plea bargaining works and what decision is best for them; whether they should plead guilty and accept certain punishment or take their chances and go to trial in hopes of being acquitted. Therefore, PWMI need attorneys who will really go to bat for them and who will be willing to go to trial and defend them rather than simply getting these individuals to plead guilty to some lesser charge. Perhaps attorneys may feel that they might lose if they go to trial because the defendant is incapable of adequately assisting them, however, in this case attorneys should have their clients evaluated for competency to stand trial. "
159,"Hi Steve! Great post! Even after all of the material we learned about this week, it is really difficult to determine whether inpatient or outpatient commitment is more effective for PWMI given that they each have very similar drawbacks (i.e. coercive, stigmatizing, discriminatory, anti-therapeutic, etc.). Moreover, it appears as though the effective of both of these types of civil commitment have yet to be determined. Inpatient commitment provides 24-hour care and supervision, however, a large majority of involuntary committed persons did not believe that, ""[they needed] hospital admission [and that their] admission was unjustified"" (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013, p. 122). To add to this, many of these individuals felt adversely about the treatment they had received even after being discharged for a number of years. Besides these negative views with respect to inpatient commitment, outpatient commitment is also problematic. Not only is outpatient commitment infrequently used, but PWMI who have endured such treatment, ""have reported little satisfaction with the treatment received"" (p. 154). In addition, there are people who contend that, ""[outpatient commitment is simply] not doing much to improve patients' lives to justify [such a high] level of state control"" (p. 158). In other words, perhaps use of outpatient commitment and some of its procedures (i.e. medication management, individual and group counseling) should be curbed until there is more research being done to see what works. However, this may be a very difficult task because the simple fact of the matter is that situations vary, and it is difficult to monitor progress. First, some PWMI will fare well with individual therapy, whereas others might benefit from group therapy; another group may even need both. Second, PWMI may have to change from one medication to another until one works, or they may need a number of psychotropic drugs. Third, some patients could need substance abuse treatment and even help finding a place to live if they are homeless. Finally, there are stressors and events in peoples' lives that will cause great distress and possibly rehospitalization at some point. Thus, trying to help PWMI is not an easy task for mental health professionals or mental health facilities which may lack adequate resources, funding, and services to treat this population. In truth, I think that inpatient and outpatient commitment are not perfect modalities, but at the end of t"
160,"One benefit that might arise for PWMI as a result of the recent changes in California corrections to shift a large number of state felons to county jails is that PWMI in the community who commit minor transgressions may be much less likely to become incarcerated considering that state prisons and jails are in the process of drastically downsizing their current inmate populations. Essentially, PWMI might be given more ""slack"" for their offenses or even bypassed altogether if law enforcement officers deem that incarceration of these persons would be futile. On the other hand, PWMI that are already being detained in jail for committing low-level crimes may be released from jail early due to overcrowding. Nevertheless, another benefit from shifting responsibility from states to local jails is that state prisons would accumulate more savings from having less inmates in their facilities. This in turn, allows more money to be redirected towards mental health services that could lessen the number of PWMI coming into contact with police officers who may or may not incarcerate these individuals. Even though transferring state felons to jails might produce some benefits for PWMI, such measures are also very problematic. For instance, county jails have a lack of funding, and PWMI who are being detained in them may not be getting adequate treatment in these facilities. Furthermore, it is possible that PWMI who are in jails may be victimized by more serious offenders that are transferring into these institutions from state prisons. PWMI are already vulnerable as it is, and having them detained alongside felons could place them at risk. "
161,"I do not necessarily think it is fair that police officers are first responders to situations involving PWMI because there are too many annual fatalities in which persons suffering from severe mental illness are wrongly killed by police officers. For instance, many individuals who experience psychotic episodes (hallucinations, delusions, both hallucinations and delusions) end up being murdered because they have difficulty controlling their thoughts, urges, or behaviors. Unfortunately, their adverse symptoms can make them a danger to themselves or others, which places PWMI at risk for homicide at the hands of police officers that may be ill-equipped to deal effectively with their illness. Instead of having police be first responders, perhaps a better alternative would be to have mental health professionals assist police officers in critical situations. Mental health professionals have specialized knowledge and skills which may prove advantageous when conversing with persons in crisis. Therefore these individuals (i.e. psychiatrists, psychologists) should attempt to de-escalate situations before police officers have to step in and take more drastic measures to prevent PWMI from harming themselves or others. If a particular scenario does not involve any weapons  (i.e. knife, gun, other dangerous tool), then there is no need for violence (i.e. shooting PWMI). Police should be able to detain PWMI without having to resort to using excessive and unnecessary tactics.  "
162,"Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) training reduces law enforcement officers' stigmatizing attitudes towards PWMI. Many police officers lack the necessary insight into mental illness and the symptoms and behaviors that can manifest from various disorders. Perhaps as a result of this unawareness, police officers have a tendency to view PWMI as ""crazy"" persons rather someone in crisis. Moreover, when officers do not realize that certain individuals are being aggressive or combative due to their mental illness, they may harm (i.e. shoot and kill) these people rather than responding to them appropriately. Thus, training programs such as CIT are really indispensable because they provide law enforcement personnel with the skills needed to converse with PWMI in an attempt to diffuse situations. As we learned from the Youtube video, certain scenarios involving PWMI can become dangerous rather quickly if police officers respond to them inappropriately. Nevertheless, by thoroughly educating officers with respect to mental illness (i.e. mandating CIT training), this in turn reduces the stigma associated with it. Rather than law enforcement officers continuing to treat PWMI in the community as unstable, erratic, and ""dangerous"" offenders, they should look at these persons as people who are in need of help or treatment which may or may not be available to them. Nonetheless, the goal in dealing with PWMI should focus on ""compassion"" instead of ""criminalization."" "
163,"I would still continue to use the Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) Model for PWMI even though there are mixed reviews as far as its effectiveness; the reason being that it is not doing any harm, so why not keep using it until more research is carried out (Taheri, 2016, p. 92). Moreover, there are certain benefits as far as implementing and utilizing a CIT program. Nevertheless, in this discussion I will provide some background information on CIT, whether it has been successful or not in accomplishing its goals, and my suggestions on improvement. First and foremost, CIT is a jail diversion program that seeks to reduce the number of mentally ill persons who are incarcerated as a result of encounters with police (p. 76). Furthermore, these programs are designed to direct PWMI in crisis to mental health facilities where they can get appropriate treatment (p. 77). Finally, the goal of CIT programs is to reduce arrests of PWMI as well as prevent injury or death of both law enforcement officers and mentally ill persons. Besides understanding the aim of CIT programs, it is important to mention the reasons why such police-diversion programs are in place. Police officers have a great deal of contact with PWMI in the community, and it is reported that, “between 7 to 10% of police contacts involve encounters with persons with mental illness” (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013, p. 183). Moreover, nearly 1 in 10 calls made to local police departments involve an incident with an individual experiencing a mental health crisis (Turner, 2019, Lesson 4-4). Clearly, it is apparent that law enforcement officers frequently come across PWMI, however, these interactions tend to result in their arrest and subsequent incarceration (predominantly for minor offenses) (Taheri, 2016, p. 77). Furthermore, it is also reported that numerous PWMI are killed every year during confrontations with police officers (Turner, 2019, Lesson 4-3). Often times, police are ill-equipped to deal effectively with PWMI because they lack training or they have misperceptions that, “[these individuals are] incapable of reasoning and are violent” (Slate et al., 2013, p. 184). Unfortunately, this type of thinking lends itself for officers to use force against PWMI, which in turn has the propensity to result in violence. Therefore, CIT programs were essentially implemented in order to change the dynamic between police officers and PWMI, and to reduce arrests and casualties ensuing from their intera"
164,"Hi Clara!  Awesome post! I touched upon many of the same points that you addressed in your discussion. I also believe that CIT programs should continue to be used until there is sufficient evidence that indicates otherwise. Even though the Taheri article revealed that CIT results are mixed (no differences between CIT-trained officers and non CIT-trained officers when it comes to number of arrests or use of force in relation to PWMI), or there is not enough data to draw certain conclusions (reduction in officer injuries), I still feel that there should be mandated information sessions for all police officers, irrespective of whether officers have intentions of joining a specialized unit (i.e. CIT) that specifically provides training on how to interact with PWMI (Taheri, 2016). Thus, like you indicated in your post, I agree that law enforcement personnel, whether CIT-trained or non CIT-trained, should receive ""formal education"" in relation to mental illness and its detrimental effect on people. Officers should be able to recognize signs and symptoms of mental illness, however, this might be somewhat difficult because they are not health care professionals (i.e. physicians, nurses, psychologists, social workers, etc.). Moreover, police officers may not know the medical history of an individual who has suffered from chronic or severe mental illness, which often causes officers to come into these situations without pertinent background information. Nevertheless, continuing to educate officers about mental illness is important, and perhaps mandated information sessions should take place once every 5 or 10 years, because mentally ill individuals do come into contact with police more or less frequently. For instance, it is reported that, ""on average officers have six encounters per month with a person with mental illness in crisis"" (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013, p. 184). Therefore, it makes sense to provide information to law enforcement officers whether or not they hold the perspective that they are crime fighters rather than service providers (p. 190). Finally, it is also important to note that  implementing such programs is not costly. The only real expenditure includes having hiring instructors to come and teach officers (p. 211).  Great post! "
165,"Hi Jennifer!  Great post! You brought up such an important point about the Taheri study, in that the results were based upon a handful of studies. More specifically, only eight studies (5 published reports; 3 unpublished reports) were analyzed with respect to interactions between police officers and PWMI (Taheri, 2016, p. 82). Clearly, there needs to be more meta-analytic studies done on CIT programs across the nation to gather better information. Furthermore, it is interesting that there is little data given that the Memphis model was implemented in 1988, which was about three decades ago (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013, p. 213). Thus, we should be careful in analyzing and interpreting results of the Taheri study given that it includes data from a few police departments. Nevertheless, I also liked how you presented statistics in relation to the number of police-related homicides. It is a fact that PWMI are killed at the hands of police officers and many of these incidents could be unlawful deaths. Therefore, it is crucial that police officers be knowledgeable about mental illness in general, and how adverse symptoms can affect individuals. For instance, officers may fail to realize that, ""mentally ill individuals who hear voices cannot follow commands"" (Turner, 2019, Lesson 4-3). Aside from hallucinations, PWMI experience a host of other symptoms (i.e delusions) that inhibit them from behaving in a manner desired by police. Besides having to learn about mental illness in order to gain insight into people's behavior, police officers should be required to understand how mental illness works because, ""the police are often the first responders when dealing with persons with mental illnesses in crisis ... "" (Slate et al., 2013, p. 183). In other words, they are responsible for many outcomes involving PWMI (i.e. arrests, conviction, incarceration, transport to mental health facility, etc.). If officers are going to arrests individuals suffering from mental illness, they should do so by making the best decision possible in a given situation, and avoiding jail as much as possible. "
166,"When we look at mental illness in jails, and whether it is being addressed appropriately (proper treatment), we should look at various indicators including, but not limited to, ratio of medical professional staff to inmates, available psychiatric beds, and number of psychotic episodes. First and foremost, the amount of medical personnel that are able to treat inmates at any given time is an important factor when it comes to mental illness in jails because a large proportion of inmates suffer from mental disorders. Penal institutions hold thousands of inmates, thus there should be an adequate number of staff to inmates in order to address mental health needs. For instance, having only one psychiatric physician within a facility or on call would be negligent if there are dozens of inmates who experience crises on a daily basis. Besides having a sufficient amount of staff members, jails should also have a certain number of psychiatric beds available for inmates who undergo crisis. If a particular jail has no designated psychiatric beds due to a lack of funds or resources, then inmates who need specialized treatment have nowhere safe to be detained during psychotic episodes. Instead of having to remain in their cells while being treated, these inmates need to be in a special unit where they will be under supervision until they are stabilized. Aside from ensuring that mentally ill inmates are being treated in proper conditions, another indicator that jails are taking measures to provide acceptable mental health care is to examine the number of psychotic episodes experienced by inmates. For instance, if the number of psychotic episodes continues to increase dramatically rather than decrease, then this could indicate that persons with mental illness are not being treated which is problematic. Essentially, a reduction in psychotic episodes reveals progress where mental illness is concerned. "
167,"As we learned in the 60 Minutes segment, there are a large number of mentally ill persons in jails and prisons across the United States. Penal institutions like Cook County Jail in Chicago, Illinois are notorious for housing an immense amount of PWMI; the figure ranges anywhere from 2,500 to 2,800 mentally ill inmates, many of whom are incarcerated for petty theft and trespassing. Moreover, some of these inmates have been recycled in-and-out of the same jail hundreds of times. This is incredibly alarming and saddening at the same time. How is it possible for jails to incriminate and detain a an individual with mental illness this number of times without it indicating red flags. Clearly, rehabilitation is not working, and rather than being cognizant of this, jails release these persons back into the community and merely provide them with a packet of psychotropic medications to get them by for a little bit. Releasing individuals with severe mental illness back on to the streets without adequate medication, counseling/therapy, or supervision is simply being impervious to their needs. These PWMI need help, and they probably have no hope or expectation of getting better because both the criminal justice and mental health system have failed them. The jails either provide them with insufficient treatment or none at all which explains some individuals being arrested and jailed hundreds of times, whereas the community simply does not have enough state hospitals or clinics to treat PWMI. "
168,"I forgot to add that overall, it must feel demoralizing for PWMI to be in-and-out of jail over and over again, and knowing that the next time will be no different than the last.  "
169,"I am not necessarily sure whether jail inmates are given too few rights, but I do think that the rights they are afforded are too restrictive. For example, inmates have the right to free speech and they can communicate with the outside world via phone calls and letters, however, the time of their calls are limited and they cannot use computers to email. Moreover, the content in their letters is read by prison personnel before it goes out and comes in, which to me invades someone's privacy. In society, you cannot simply read, view, or look through someone else's personal belongings/items unless there is a good reason or justification for doing so  (i.e. search warrant). However, I also understand that this process is done as a security measure to keep jails more secure. Aside from giving inmates a little more leeway as far as communication is concerned, I also think jails should allow these individuals more ""visiting"" time with family, friends, etc. As we learned from the second video, more than half of prisoners (60 percent) are serving time in prison for non-violent drug offenses and immigration crimes. Thus, I do not think these types of crimes merit such restrictive rules. Having human interaction is vital and necessary for people's wellbeing, and even though these individuals are viewed as ""criminals""; this does not mean they should be treated as less than human or not given a little more freedom when it comes to certain things (i.e. number of visits). Nevertheless, I also believe that inmates should have the right to freedom and the right to medical treatment which they are granted; and rightfully so.  However, I think that inmates also have the right to be ""free from harm"" while incarcerated, yet many of them are physically and sexually assaulted in jails and prisons. The video mentioned that sexual harassment is hardly ever prosecuted, and from my perspective this is an egregious wrong. Inmates should not be able to be assaulted and raped in penal institutions when they are under surveillance and supervision by local and state authorities. For instance, it could very well be the case that an innocent person who could not make bail is beaten and abused prior to his or her trial, which in turn has the propensity to affect them for the rest of their life by inducing anxiety, depression, PTSD, suicide ideation and attempts, etc. While I understand that these situations can and do occur, I think that being in prison is punishment enough, and inmates d"
170,"I think that medication is still the most common form of treatment for PWMI in jails even though it is fairly costly, because medication can and does manage symptoms in many psychiatric patients. For example, medications lessen or eliminate delusions or hallucinations in inmates, or calm patients down. That being said, other forms of treatment such as telepsychiatry or psychotherapy (counseling) may not work for well patients who require medication, in addition to other forms of treatment. Moreover, it is important to keep in mind that various psychotropic medications are quite expensive and jails need to have enough supply to treat inmates who suffer from mental illness; being short of supply may constitute negligence. In my opinion, jails should keep track of their annual medication expenses as far as medications/psychotropic drugs are concerned, and states should mandate that pharmaceutical companies not only provide them with medications they need, but these companies should provide drugs at heavily reduced/discounted prices so that a large portion of jail budgets are not only going towards purchasing psychotropic drugs. Having less medication expenditures will enable jails to spend money on other important measures such as ""good/gain time earned,"" educational, or reentry programs. "
171,"The use of jails for persons with severe mental illness is inappropriate given lack of adequate funding, conditions of confinement (i.e. physical space, victimization), and operational restraints (i.e. rule violations, use of isolation) (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013, p. 236, 237). First and foremost, it is important to note that the prevalence of mental illness among inmates (jail and prison) is quite high, with 15 to 20 percent of them having a serious mental illness (Raphael & Stoll, 2013, p. 187; Torrey, E. F., Kennard, A. D., Eslinger, D., Lamb, R., & Pavle, J., 2010, p. 6). Nonetheless, this number is worrisome given that penal institutions such as jails are simply ill-equipped to serve PWMI, especially those experiencing crisis (Slate et al., 2013, p. 270). Yet despite this fact, jails continue to treat this particular group while failing to meet their various needs. For example, jails are inundated with inmates and overcrowding is constantly a problem. Moreover, the conditions in jails makes it exceptionally difficult for PWMI to cope effectively while in these institutions due to noise, disruptions, and the lights being on during all hours (p. 236). Thus, not only do mentally ill individuals have to deal with adverse symptoms (i.e. anxiety, depression, hallucinations, delusions, mania, psychosis, etc.) of their particular disorder, but they also have to adjust to an over stimulated environment that could exacerbate their mental illness. Aside from jail conditions worsening symptoms of PWMI, these facilities are also unsafe for this vulnerable group. Unfortunately, mentally ill persons in jails, “are at elevated risk for assault and victimization” (Raphael & Stoll, 2013, p. 220). That being said, it is unjust for these individuals to be targeted and physically or sexually attacked due to their vulnerabilities. PWMI need more protection in jails and if this is not provided, then they need to be detained in a separate designated area away from the rest of the inmate population. Not only will such a measure preserve their safety, but it could also improve their wellbeing if they are afforded with cells that provide them with more privacy and less stimulation (i.e. less noise, intermittent lighting). Besides addressing poor and harmful conditions in jails, it is also worth mentioning that certain operational constraints as a result of rule violations by inmates is incredibly problematic. Jails have rigid rules in place wh"
172,"Hi Caroline! You brought up some really great points in your post! I agree that the drastic reduction in inpatient psychiatric beds has caused a great deal of problems for PWMI. One of the articles in this week's reading mentioned that, in 1955 there was one psychiatric bed available for every 300 people, however, in 2004 there happened to be only one bed available for every 3,000 people (Torrey, Kennard, Eslinger, Lamb, & Pavle, 2010, p. 8). This is a huge step backwards for the mental health system, and it is inconceivable that there are currently less psychiatric beds for PWMI today than there was in the 1950s; even though nowadays mental illness is quite prevalent and has garnered much awareness. To add to this, the number of severely mentally ill inmates (constitute 15 to 20 percent of penal institutions) in jails and prisons is concerning, and this number is continuing to rise (Slate et al., 2013, p. 231, 232). Nevertheless, like you, I also feel that jails and prisons are not meant to house or treat PWMI given that the primary goals of penal institutions are to punish and rehabilitate offenders; not treat ""sick"" persons who require psychiatric care. Moreover, jail personnel, with the exception of mental health professionals (i.e. psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, etc.), do not have the necessary skills or tools to address the needs of persons suffering from mental illness or crises. Thus, it is interesting that jail staff members often ""screen"" for mental illness during intake of inmates. Aside from the prevalence of serious mental illness in jails and prisons as well as inappropriate treatment of PWMI, Public Safety Realignment, specifically in California, influenced the treatment of mentally ill persons. As you stated Realignment was problematic, but I liked how you brought up that it had the propensity to ""recycle"" PWMI in-and-out of jails. This is a great point, because with Realignment, jail populations increased to a point where certain offenders were released early, and those that were released were probably more likely to be PWMI rather than other offenders. As we learned, ""[PWMI] are often arrested for minor crimes such as shoplifting [or] engaging in lewd behavior ..."" (Raphael & Stoll, 2013, p. 191). That being said, Realignment may have released a number of mentally ill persons back into the community, however, it might only be a matter of time before these untreated individuals will come into contact with the crim"
173,"Hi Wendy!  Great post! I shared many of the same exact sentiments that you did in my own discussion, but I really liked your concluding statement, in which you expressed that jails in California post-Realignment ""could be a nightmare"" for the mentally ill. While Realignment is beneficial for some inmates (i.e. those convicted of non-serious, non-violent, non-sexual crimes), it may prove disastrous for PWMI who are already vulnerable due to their mental illness. First, overcrowding ensuing transfer of prison inmates into county jails might produce poorer conditions in the penal facilities. Second, jails could become understaffed which results in two scenarios: less PWMI receiving supervision and/or treatment, or PWMI being treated improperly by staff who are overburdened and stressed. Finally, as you said, housing mentally ill inmates alongside those transferred into jails from state prisons may lead to violence or assault of PWMI. Given the above information, treatment of seriously mentally ill persons within jails is not a great idea, however, a better alternative might be the implementation of ""psychiatric jails"" or assisted outpatient treatment (AOT) (Torrey, Kennard, Eslinger, Lamb, & Pavle, 2010, p. 11, 12). In addition, I think it is important to note that many inmates do not receive mental health treatment even though they require it. For example, the text states that, ""[the] prevalence of mental illness among jail inmates vary widely - from 6% to 64%"" (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, Johnson, 2013, p. 228). To add to this, it is reported that, ""of inmates with mental illness, 34% received medication and only 16% received therapy or counseling"" (Slate et al., 2013, p. 256). Thus, when taken together, these two statistics are fairly worrisome depending on the number of mentally ill inmates in a particular jail. For instance, let's say that there are 10,000 inmates in a certain jail. If 6% of this population are mentally ill, this equates to 600 inmates. Moreover, of these 600 mentally ill inmates, it is estimated that 204 of them receive medications and 96 of them receive therapy/counseling. On the other hand, if 64% of all of the jail inmates (10,000) are mentally ill, this equates to 6,400 inmates; and of these 6,400 inmates with mental illness, only 2,176 are receiving medications and 1,024 are receiving therapy/counseling. Therefore, it appears as though persons with mental illness in jails are not receiving enough treatment or mental he"
174,"I think it would be ""fair"" to use risk assessment tools if they were fairly accurate in their predictions. While it may be difficult to get risk assessment tools that are 100% accurate, I think that tools that are able to make predictions with 70% accuracy or higher, should be utilized. First, these tools are evidence-based, meaning not only have they been used/tested on certain populations (i.e. inmates, sexually violent predators), but they have produced somewhat desirable results. In addition, these tools make it easier for certain people in criminal justice system to carry out their jobs in a more efficient and timely manner. For example, rather than judges having to make judgments about sentencing based upon an offender's transgression, prior offenses, age, education, employment status, etc., risk assessment tools produce a sentence based upon all of these factors so that judges do no have to do so; essentially allowing them to review more cases. On the other hand, use of risk assessment tools would not be fair if accuracy was low (anything less than 70%). In this case, certain individuals might be given inappropriate sentences; or sentences that are shorter or longer than they should be. Furthermore, low accuracy could mean that a particular risk assessment tool is not measuring what it should be measuring (i.e. future likelihood of reoffending, recidivism), or including relevant risk factors. "
175,"I think that mental health professionals would be receptive to the RNR approach with PWMI in the criminal justice system. The RNR Model focuses on dynamic risk factors such as substance abuse, antisocial friends, and antisocial behaviors that should be addressed when treating offenders. Given this information, rather than solely focusing on recidivism, mental health professionals would also benefit from looking at factors like substance abuse when it comes to PWMI considering that many mentally ill persons have co-occurring substance abuse disorders. However, there are also other factors that have great significance such as homelessness, maltreatment or abuse in childhood or adolescence, foster care placement, and parental incarceration. All of these factors have the propensity to affect PWMI, therefore in order to treat these individuals and prevent them from potentially entering the criminal justice system or recycling through it if they have previously been incarcerated, mental health professionals should target each of these areas. When PWMI are given therapy, medication, alcohol and drug treatment, health care, employment, and housing, they would function better overall. Emotional and physical wellbeing, in addition to economic and job security reduces the likelihood of an individual coming into contact with the justice system in the near future. "
176,"I think that using probation with respect to mentally ill offenders is a much better alternative than resorting to jail or confinement of these individuals. As we learned previously, PWMI commit minor transgressions such as trespassing or stealing/theft which do not warrant detention. Therefore, mentally ill persons who commit such crimes should be able to serve their sentences out in the community. Furthermore, jails and prisons are not suited to provide adequate mental health care for PWMI. The conditions of penal institutions (i.e. overcrowded, noisy, too much light, etc.) as well as the use of operational constraints (physical restraints, isolation) have proven to exacerbate symptoms of PWMI, in turn eliciting aggression or violence from these individuals. Finally, jails and prisons could be understaffed and underfunded, leading to lack of or insufficient treatment (i.e. available psychiatrists, effective psychiatric medications, ""mental health"" or padded cells). Provided this information, it makes sense to place PWMI who have committed lower-level offenses on probation just like other non-mentally ill offenders who commit similar crimes. However, probation officers should request counseling/therapy, medication compliance, substance abuse treatment, and cheap housing for PWMI given that they may be homeless or abuse drugs or alcohol. Essentially, we should not be locking up offenders with serious mental illness, but instead providing them with a means of punishment (probation) that is beneficial rather than punitive. "
177,"I would certainly prefer a mental health court to a traditional court if I were a mentally ill defendant who committed an offense. The traditional court is much more punitive and sends mentally ill offenders to jail or prison for their crimes, where they often receive little to no mental health treatment, or insufficient care while incarcerated. Moreover, once these PWMI are released back into the community, they may or may not be given a discharge plan. Some offenders are merely given a packet of pills (medication) and told to go and seek community services on their own. In essence, traditional courts do not offer as much attention and care to mentally ill offenders in comparison to mental health courts. Mental health courts are heavily focused on rehabilitation and treatment, and take measures to provide PWMI an opportunity to receive various treatment services in the community rather than incarcerating them. These services include substance abuse treatment, medication management, etc., which are extremely beneficial for persons suffering from mental illness. When it comes down to it, the mental health court is enabling these individuals to get better (mentally and physically) and to progress by providing them with services they may not otherwise get in the community. In addition, it is important to note that serving time in the community imposes a less severe sentence for PWMI who commit offenses. "
178,"The Risk-Need-Responsivity (RNR) Model was originally introduced to reduce recidivism among offenders by addressing pertinent factors that influence the likelihood of offending such as “antisocial behavior, antisocial personality, antisocial cognition, antisocial attitudes, family or marital discord, poor school or work performance, few recreational activities, and substance abuse” (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013, p. 377, 378). Essentially, the goal of the model was to determine the presence or absence of each of these factors in higher-risk offenders, and to provide cognitive behavioral treatment that would change the way offenders thought about and responded to various situations (Turner, 2019, Lecture 6-1). Given the risk factors that comprised the RNR model and the type of treatment provided to offenders, the model was also applied to offenders with mental illness in order to reduce reoffending among this group which happens to occur frequently. Moreover, this model was thought to be especially beneficial for mentally ill offenders because besides merely focusing on psychiatric symptoms, it focused on factors that are incredibly prevalent among persons with mental illness. For example, mentally ill offenders are more likely than non-mentally ill offenders to experience “homelessness, physical and sexual abuse, substance abuse, foster care placement as children, and parental incarceration,” all of which increase the propensity to commit crime (Turner, 2019, Lecture 6-2). Given this information, the RNR model is being used to treat mentally ill offenders, however, researchers caution about applying this approach to PWMI until more research is carried out revealing that it is effective with this particular group. Essentially, the RNR model is being applied to mentally ill offenders because of the mere belief that it will be effective given the risk factors that affect both mentally ill and non-mentally ill offenders, however, “[there is] no empirical support for the responsivity principle among persons with mental illness [up to date]” (Skeem, Steadman, & Manchak, 2015, p. 920). Despite the lack of available research, this does not mean that the RNR model is ineffective. Addressing both psychiatric symptoms and “criminogenic” risk factors would only prove to be more beneficial for offenders who are mentally ill. Therefore, a Chief Probation Officer supervising a mentally ill offender who is on probation should not only utilize the RN"
179,"Hi Briana!  Great post! I had similar sentiments in my discussion, and I stated that the RNR model should still be used even though there is no evidence as of yet to determine whether it would be effective as far as mentally ill offenders. From my perspective, the model has been successful with non-mentally ill offenders and it could prove to be the same for those with mental illness given that both of these groups have the same criminogenic risk factors which propel them to commit crime (Slate et al., 2013, p. 377, 378; Turner, 2019, Lecture 6-2). Moreover, it certainly would not hurt to use the RNR model considering it teaches cognitive behavioral techniques that have the propensity the alter thinking and behavior, which is needed among this group. Nevertheless, you mentioned that addressing and reducing violence is a difficult task for probation officers, however, there are other factors that they could try to tackle such as substance abuse and homelessness among PWMI. For example, the textbook indicates that, ""up to 70% of [persons] with a serious mental illnesses [also have] substance abuse and/or dependence [issues],"" while ""20 to 33% of homeless persons in the U.S. have a mental disorder"" (Slate et al., 2013, p. 80, 84). Perhaps if these problems were taken care of, in addition to obtaining health insurance (i.e. therapy and medication expenses), PWMI would be much better off or at least not deteriorate as rapidly to the point they are institutionalized or incarcerated.  "
180,"Hey Nani! Great post! Like you, I mentioned that when it come to mentally ill offenders probation officers need to address signs and symptoms of mental illness, criminogenic risk factors, substance abuse and dependence, employment, homelessness, and past trauma (i.e. physical and sexual abuse) (Turner 2019, Lecture 6-1, 6-2, 6-3). Each of these factors would have to be taken care of in some capacity in order to see any type of improvement among offenders. Therefore, treatment of mentally ill as well as non-mentally ill offenders is exceptionally difficult and complex; trying to get people back on track is no easy feat. Moreover, it is easy to merely provide solutions, but getting all of these individuals the treatment and services they need may prove impossible. There is not enough funding or available mental health services and resources. However, something needs to be done given how many persons with mental illness are incarcerated in jails and prisons in the United States. Thus, mental health or speciality courts are a good starting point (Turner, 2019, Lecture 6-4). Additionally, having speciality probation officers is also a step in the right direction, however, these officers will need a significant amount of help from the community to get PWMI treatment (i.e. counseling, medication, jobs, housing). "
181,"There were a few concerning aspects of the prison system environment that might aggravate conditions of persons with mental illness. First, prisons house more inmates than jails and they also have more violent inmates. Thus, individuals who are mentally ill could have issues being alongside more hardened criminals. For example, PWMI may be more vulnerable to victimization (i.e. physical and sexual assault), or they may aggravate other inmates because of symptoms (i.e. mania) associated with their mental illness. Moreover, it is important to note that symptoms of their particular disorder (i.e. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, etc.) could make PWMI combative which could land them in solitary confinement. Unfortunately, many prison staff members are not trained to deal effectively with PWMI, which may cause them to use excessive force with these individuals. Finally, some prisons may not have adequate mental health care or a mental health unit in the facility, which is problematic for persons suffering with severe mental illness. "
182,"Given the video, I do not think it is possible to truly rehabilitate prisoners with mental illness because there are too many hurdles to overcome. First, the environment in and of itself or the prison conditions exacerbate symptoms of mental illness, which can make inmates susceptible to excessive force (i.e. physical restraints) by guards or mistreatment (i.e. physical or sexual assault) by other inmates. Second, there are individuals with chronic and severe mental illness (major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia) which need continuous and extensive mental health treatment, yet this type of treatment may be unavailable in prisons due to shortage of staffing, inadequate medications, segregated mental health unit, etc. Third, prisoners often need assistance in a variety of domains such as substance abuse, employment, cheap or affordable housing, counseling, psychotropic medications, amongst others. Thus, addressing and providing these necessities for all prisoners with mental illness is difficult if not impossible to accomplish. Funding for both the mental health and the criminal justice systems would have to increase drastically, and community-based treatment options would have to be much more available. "
183,"I think that solitary confinement is a terrible measure as far as controlling prisoners and maintaining prison order. Solitary confinement is exceptionally punitive and has extremely detrimental effects on inmates. Inmates are isolated for up to 23 hours a day and have no contact or stimulation while in isolation. In other words, they cannot see, communicate, or interact with anyone other than themselves. Moreover, some isolation cells do not even have windows for sunlight to come in, which is necessary for one's health. Nevertheless, prisoners go ""crazy"" in these cells and start to experience paranoia and disturbing and violent thoughts. Finally, when prisoners are released back into the main population with other inmates, they have trouble assimilating back into the ""prison culture."" These inmates isolate themselves and fear any interaction with others, which could actually place them in jeopardy. For instance, it could very well be the case that they become easy targets for other prisoners. Thus, provided the information above, I believe that solitary confinement constitutes ""cruel and unusual"" punishment and it should be used as a last resort to curb inmate behavior. I also think that if isolation is going to continue to be used for inmates, then changes need to be made with respect to its use. For example, isolation should only be a few hours and cells should have windows. Finally, inmates should be checked on periodically to ensure the state of their mental health and wellbeing. "
184,"I think that tax dollars going towards treating mentally ill persons in prisons is reasonable. Clearly, there is a very large number of mentally ill individuals in prisons, and this group needs adequate treatment to manage their disorders and symptoms. From my perspective, inmates deserve mental health care irrespective of whether they are deemed as ""criminals."" Essentially, society has a duty and an obligation (i.e. constitutional right to medical and mental health care) to provide prisoners with ""humane treatment."" However, given how expensive treatment in the prison system is versus treatment in the community, perhaps tax dollars should be reallocated so that we are building more community-based mental health facilities. This option is much less restrictive  and less punitive than incarceration, but the effectiveness of such treatment has yet to be determined. Therefore, tax payer dollars may be better spent on creating ""segregation units"" in prisons that provide open environments as well as more treatment services and contact with mental health professionals. Prisons should have segregated areas where seriously mentally ill offenders are monitored and assessed more often, provided with medications and counseling services, and given additional ""outside time."" Furthermore, implementation of segregation units would keep mentally ill offenders safer in prisons (i.e. better protected against assault by other inmates and prison staff). "
185,"It is reported that, “over 2.2 million people are incarcerated in jails and prisons” in the United States, and roughly 16 percent of all jail inmates have a serious mental illness, whereas this number is around 15 percent for all prison inmates (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013, p. 231, 420; Turner, 2013, Lecture 7-1). Even though jails and prisons were never meant to service the severely mentally ill, these institutions are now liable to do so given the sheer number of mentally ill individuals in penal institutions across the country. Moreover, under the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, “[any inmate with serious mental illness is] entitled to psychological and psychiatric care” (Slate et al., 2013, p. 435). However, despite being granted this right, many PWMI in jails and prisons receive inadequate or no treatment for their mental illness which creates problems for both PWMI and correctional staff who interact with them. Having said that, most department of corrections mental health chief administrators have contended that, “treating offenders with mental illness is one of the greatest challenges facing department of corrections today” (p. 422). To add to this, it is exceptionally costly to house and treat inmates with mental illness versus inmates without mental illness (Turner, 2019, Lecture 7-4). Thus, given the information above, it is imperative to contain costs associated with incarceration, provide sufficient mental health treatment for PWMI, and keep this group as well as correctional personnel safe.             From my perspective, addressing safety concerns and providing adequate treatment is possible, however, sustaining costs while doing so would be difficult. As it stands, a portion of taxpayer money across states is allocated towards maintaining penal institutions. In California alone, it costs up to 75,000 dollars to detain and house a prisoner, and this number is even higher for a mentally ill inmate (Turner, 2019, Lecture 7-1). Furthermore, psychotropic medications are incredibly expensive as evidenced by a 2009 Consumer Report which revealed that, “[just] a single antipsychotic medication could have an average monthly cost of $1,434” (Slate et al., 2013, p. 263). Based on this information, it is easy to see how medication costs account for a large proportion of penal institution budgets. However, it is difficult to determine what this number is considering that, “states spend [anywhere] between 2.5% to 6"
186,"Hi Caroline! You brought up some interesting points in your discussion. You mention that inmates should be grouped together based upon their level/degree of dangerousness (i.e. propensity to fight with others), however, I am not exactly sure how this measure would work? It may be really difficult to predict who will be a threat/danger to others, or who will be more likely to commit a crime while incarcerated unless you were to consider factors such as prior offense(s) and type of offense. Furthermore, this may create great controversy if certain inmates are housed alongside others (i.e. more or less hardened criminals) based off of predictions. In fact, there is controversy right now surrounding accuracy of both actuarial and clinical risk assessments when it comes to, ""predicting dangerousness or criminal recidivism"" (Adams & Ferrandino, 2008). To add to this, it may extremely time consuming and costly if both clinical and actuarial risk assessments were conducted with every inmate in jails or prisons for purposes of grouping inmates; this is no easy feat and assessments may be prone to error. Additionally, I completely agree with you that PWMI should not be propelled into the criminal justice system and as you said, they should be directed towards treatment alternatives in the community (i.e. hospitals, clinics), however, this is not the reality of the situation. Perhaps this may change in the future with more jail-version practices but for the time being, there should be adequate mental health services for persons suffering with severe mental illness in penal institutions. Moreover, treatment of mentally ill inmates in jails and prisons is certainly costly, but obtaining inpatient psychiatric hospital care with or without insurance is fairly expensive as well (Stensland, Watson & Grazier, 2012).     References  Stensland, M., Watson, P. R., & Grazier, K. L. (2012). An examination of costs, charges, and payments for inpatient psychiatric treatment in community hospitals. Psychiatric Services, 63(7), p. 666-671. "
187,"Hi Stephanie!  I enjoyed reading your post! I liked how you incorporated class materials as well as your own thoughts. I particularly agree with you that both groups of offenders (mentally ill and non-mentally ill) should have equal access to behavioral programs and activities while incarcerated (Adams & Ferrandino, 2008). Essentially, programs that focus on cognitive-behavioral therapy, anger management, substance abuse, job skills, etc. are beneficial for all inmates. However, I am not sure whether I agree that mentally ill inmates should not be given more resources (additional supervision, counseling, psychotropic medication) than other inmates. The textbook indicates that around 15% of inmates in both jails and prisons are severely mentally ill and many suffer from major depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013). Thus, these individuals require appropriate treatment so that they do not deteriorate even further as a result of being placed in these punitive facilities. From my perspective, all inmates are entitled to medical and mental health treatment, but seriously mentally ill offenders are in greater need of such. For instance, an individual suffering from schizophrenia who experiences delusions and hallucinations is more likely to fare worse in a penal environments. His or her irrational/illogical thinking and subsequent behavior may lead to infractions, added incarceration time, solitary confinement, and physical or sexual victimization, whereas this may not be the case for an offender who is not mentally. In my opinion, mentally ill offenders are somewhat more vulnerable and many of them may have landed in jail or prison for minor offenses (theft, trespassing), yet they end up in a penal facility where they are targeted, victimized, and abused on the basis of their mental illness (Slate et al., 2013, p. 424). Moreover, mentally ill inmates suffering from ""non-schizophrenia-related psychotic disorders, schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorder""  are also more likely to attempt and commit suicide in comparison to other inmates (p. 424, 425). Having said that, I feel strongly that this group warrants differential treatment. "
188,"If I were taxpayer in Missouri, I would feel that construction of the new Fulton State Hospital is a positive step forward for persons with mental illness in the community. The facility was originally built back in 1851, and is one of oldest state psychiatric hospitals in the country. The newly renovated hospital is supposed to be a state of the art facility that has the capacity to deliver 24-hour care and supervision for seriously mentally ill individuals in an aesthetic and therapeutic environment. Moreover, the new facility can supplement patients with much needed psychotropic medications as well other services (i.e. individual counseling, group therapy sessions). Essentially, this state psychiatric facility is needed to provide care for PWMI who voluntarily seek commitment as well as other individuals (i.e. homeless persons) who may require involuntary civil commitment. The state hospital also benefits police officers that need somewhere to divert PWMI who are in need of psychiatric treatment. Typically, many mentally ill offenders are transferred to local jails where treatment may or not be available, but now these persons can be admitted to the state hospital. Finally, I think it is important to note that taxpayers may feel somewhat ambivalent about the new construction of Fulton State Hospital if the cost of construction and implementation is exceptionally high. However, the state hospital is certainly in need of a transformation/upgrade. "
189,"No I would not describe ""Not Guilty By Reason Of Insanity"" (NGRI) as a ""Get out of Jail Free"" card. Typically, once defendants are found to be criminally insane during the time they committed the particular offense, they are subsequently committed to a state psychiatric hospital where they receive treatment for their mental disorder(s). However, the amount of time they are institutionalized for is not determined, and individuals are committed in these state hospitals until they are no longer deemed as a threat to society. Unfortunately, judges are simply unwilling to let these persons go free again.  Essentially, judges would be taking a big gamble by allowing an individual to be released considering that he or she could very well commit another crime. Thus, judges often have to weigh the prospective freedom of this offender with the safety of the community; often times it ends up being the case that these individuals carry out indeterminate sentences which equates to the rest of their lives in psychiatric institutions (life sentence). It appears that this is the price the individuals pay for committing homicide as a result of their mental illness. Instead of having the individual incarcerated for murder, they get to live out the remainder of their lives in a restrictive but less punitive manner. "
190,"In order to keep patients and staff members safe while providing treatment, state hospitals have to have qualified staff on duty. Essentially, state hospital employees need adequate training to teach them how to deal effectively and appropriately with patients that are committed and housed in these facilities. Moreover, many DSH patients have severe mental illnesses such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, etc., which have the propensity to make them aggressive or violent. Thus, staff members need to be properly trained in working with this particular group, or at least know what to do if something should happen to go awry during an interaction. Furthermore, there always needs to be an adequate number of staff on duty in order to assist other staff members in case altercations between patients and staff should arise. For instance, if a physical assault takes place, there should be additional staff members to immediately help in such a situation. "
191,"Based on the video, I think that doctors using deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a treatment for severe depression could prove to be really beneficial for certain patients. Unfortunately, there are many people who are seriously depressed and as a result of their disorder, want to kill themselves. In my opinion, a life devoid of emotions and happiness would be incredibly difficult to endure; having only one emotion, and that being ""dread"" is no way to live for anyone. Therefore, I feel that DBS could provide patients with a more meaningful life or at least make it more fulfilling. However, I do think that much more testing needs to be done in order to determine long-term effects of such treatment for depressed individuals. Perhaps, this is why the procedure has yet to be approved by the FDA. Finally, I also think more research should be carried out and that doctors need to perform more surgeries to perfect DBS so that it can effectively be applied to more patients. In the video, researchers as well as doctors said that the procedure does not work on all patients and they are not sure as to why this is the case. Overall, DBS seems to be promising for extremely depressed persons, but then again we do not have all of the statistics with respect to how patients end up faring after having had this procedure. If a majority of patients do well, then maybe it should be used more frequently. However, it is important to note that just like all other patients undergoing surgery, DBS patients will have to understand the serious risks associated with this procedure (i.e. brain damage, infection, death)."
192,"Due to the closing of state psychiatric hospitals beginning in the 1950s and the lack of available community-based treatment programs (deinstitutionalization movement), many severely mentally ill patients ended up in jails and prisons across the United States (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013, p. 38, 39, 43, 44, 45, 46). Basically, many people suffering from serious mental illness who were receiving inpatient treatment suddenly found themselves on the streets without care, supervision, or medication. Having said that, these individuals deteriorated (mentally, physically) considerably, which subsequently led to transgression, police involvement, and incarceration. To add to this, severely mentally ill inmates who are in jails and prisons suffer greatly due to prison conditions (overcrowded, noisy, chaotic) as well as the environment (i.e. maintaining order and control; punitive sanctions such as solitary confinement for disruptive inmates) (Slate et al., 2013, p. 236, 276, 277, 421). Often times, as a result of their mental illness and penal confinement, these vulnerable offenders act out aggressively against other inmates and staff or they are victimized (physically, sexually) by them (p. 422, 423, 424). Provided the information above, I believe that tremendous effort needs to be exerted by police personnel so that seriously mentally ill offenders are directed to state psychiatric hospitals rather than penal institutions, which typically provide either inadequate or no mental health treatment. For example, the textbook reveals that, “fewer than 50 percent of mentally ill jail inmates actually receive mental health services while in custody,” and among those who do receive treatment, “[it is] often low-quality and infrequent” (p. 237). Besides jails, prisons also are ill-equipped to deal effectively with inmates with mental illness; issues with prisons include “understaffing, poor screening and tracking of mentally ill prisoners, misdiagnoses, and concerns related to proper medication” (p. 435, 437). That being said, persons suffering from serious mental illness should be diverted away from the criminal justice system and propelled towards the mental health system where they would receive better and more humane treatment. State psychiatric hospitals can provide such treatment; thus, they are crucial when it comes to individuals with mental illness.             Essentially police officers should always attempt to direct severely menta"
193,"I made an error in my post by not clarifying that the statistics in the last paragraph are based upon the composition of California's state hospitals (Atascadero, Coalinga, Metropolitan, Napa, and Patton). Therefore, the number of forensic and civilly committed patients in state hospitals in other states across the U.S. might vary. Additionally, the percentage of patients with certain diagnoses might also differ. Yet despite this information, I still do not believe that state hospitals should exclusively commit and treat only forensic patients."
194,"Hey Serenity!  Great post! I also felt that state hospitals should not exclusively be used for just forensic patients given that there is a group, albeit small, of individuals suffering from severe and chronic mental illness that need continuous care in a hospital setting (Sisti, Segal, & Emanuel, 2015). Moreover, these persons are often described as being ""chronically psychotic"" and incapable of living independently (p. 243, 244). Thus, if state hospitals closed their doors to this group, these people could very well deteriorate rapidly. Essentially, it may be difficult for family members or caretakers to look after them or keep them medication compliant. Some of them may even end up homeless without any form of mental health treatment or support to keep them somewhat stable. Nevertheless, it is also unjust and morally wrong for state hospitals to treat one type of patient (forensic) merely because these individuals make up a majority of state hospital populations, or at least when it comes to California's state hospitals. Forensic patients already have difficulty being admitted into general hospitals due to          ""[posing] a serious risk of violence towards others ... [and displaying] inappropriate sexual or other problematic behavior that would place other patients or staff at risk"" (Fisher, Geller, & Pandiani, 2009, p. 678). That being said, if general hospitals do not accept these type of patients, then state hospitals may be their only hope; thus they should remain open to forensic and non-forensic patients.   Finally, I think your idea of possibly separating forensic from civilly committed patients is interesting given that one group has committed offenses whereas another has not. However, why exactly do you propose such a measure, and do you think separating the groups might result in differential treatment for one group versus another? "
195,"Hi Caroline!  Great post! I liked that you brought up what rights ""forensic patients"" have according to Title 9 of California's Code of Regulations. I wonder if patients themselves know they have all of these rights and what exactly they entail. On the other hand, I am curious why you think state hospitals should only be used for forensic patients? What about other types of patients who are chronically and severely mentally ill and in dire need of treatment as well (Sisti, Segal, & Emanuel, 2015)? Take for instance, a homeless individual suffering from bipolar disorder and substance abuse that has with no health insurance and has been turned away from general hospitals (due to being deemed as dangerous) as well as emergency rooms (due to overcrowding and being short-staffed). Would it be okay in this scenario for a state hospital to reject this person on the basis that he or she is not a ""forensic"" patient, even if the hospital has available psychiatric beds as well as the resources to treat this individual? I personally feel that they have an obligation to provide care for such persons considering that these facilities have typically provided care for ""populations deemed inappropriate for other settings"" (Fisher, Geller, & Pandiani, 2009, p. 679). To add to this, what would happen to ""difficult-to-discharge"" patients, which are also currently treated in state hospitals? This group may also suffer if state hospitals were to turn them away as well in order to provide care for only forensic patients. "
196,"This is a difficult question because there is clearly a problem in communication, or even nonexistence of communication, between the criminal justice and mental health systems. The prevalent issue is that mentally ill individuals are coming into contact with police personnel, which subsequently results in their incarceration. Moreover, when these mentally ill inmates are in jail and prison, they do not receive adequate mental health care, and many of them may not even know they are suffering from mental illness in the first place. Nevertheless, it seems like the two systems want to get individuals with mental illness to seek treatment (i.e. counseling/therapy, medication, etc.) prior to becoming incarcerated and after being released, which in my opinion is a very difficult task. I also do not think this solves the problem of mentally ill persons who are currently detained in penal institutions that need treatment right now. Furthermore, the two experts mentions that information/data needs to be shared among the criminal justice and mental health systems, but this might prove impossible due to reasons of patient confidentiality. For example, jails and prisons do not have access to medical and mental health records for inmates, and if they were given access to this information, this may constitute a breach of privacy. Inmates may not want their personal and sensitive information shared among staff in correctional settings even if this would provide a pathway for them to get treatment. Truthfully, I am not sure what could be done to improve links between the two systems given all of the issues surrounding sharing personal information. The only way I really see this being resolved is if mentally ill inmates themselves disclose to penal staff that they suffer from mental illness and that they need help. However, I am not sure how other individuals who do not realize they have mental illness would be helped. "
197,"I am not exactly sure what a routine law enforcement encounter is like, however, the CIT trained approach seems like it works well with PWMI. CIT training essentially teaches police officers how to effectively approach and interact with persons suffering from mental illness who may be in crisis. Not only do law enforcement personnel learn about signs, symptoms, and effects of mental illness, but officers also learn de-escalation tactics which include slowing things down, communicating effectively, exhibiting patience, being understanding, and utilizing good judgment. All of these techniques are designed to reduce violence among police officers and PWMI, because injury or death can occur if police officers engage inappropriately or aggressively with mentally ill individuals. Nonetheless, even though CIT training is beneficial, it has yet to be adopted and implemented by a large number of police departments. That being said, many officers are not well-equipped to deal with PWMI, and they lack education and training when it comes to this particular group. Moreover, there have been numerous cases in which police officers end up killing mentally ill persons because of the perception that they are ""incapable of being reasoned with, unpredictable, and dangerous/violent."" Unfortunately, these beliefs have the propensity to impact how police officers respond to PWMI. Thus CIT training is needed to change this mode of thinking and to produce better outcomes among police and mentally ill persons. Essentially, CIT training educates officers and encourages more ""humane"" and ""compassionate"" treatment."
198,"I think that it takes a court order or other legal actions (i.e. lawsuits) for departments of corrections to change the way PWMI are treated mainly because of corrections staff's inability to understand mental illness in and of itself, how mental disorders affect individuals both cognitively and behaviorally, and how to handle mentally ill inmates in crisis. It is often the case that correctional staff are ill-equipped to work with mentally ill persons due to a lack of specialized training when it comes to this group. Staff in penal institutions are not aware of the signs that constitute mentally disordered behavior, and how symptoms of mental illness adversely affect individuals and cause them to either become disruptive or to act out. Thus, correctional staff will often resort to extremely aggressive or punitive measures to ""keep inmates in line."" For example, staff members might use excessive force to physically restrain an inmate or even place him or her in solitary confinement. These type of sanctions are what lead to numerous complaints and subsequent legal actions, which force correctional departments to change how they operate. Therefore, I believe that lack of education and insight with respect to severe mental disorders and their effects is what results in mishandling of inmates, which eventually leads to lawsuits and change of correctional staff behavior; in essence, everything stems from how mentally ill inmates are treated upon admission into jails and prisons. "
199,"Mental health workers may face many challenges when working with inmates in correctional settings. First, inmates may be reluctant to work with mental health workers, especially if they fear that other inmates may look at them as being ""weak"" for seeking or obtaining treatment. Moreover, inmates may not trust mental health workers or disclose personal information to them about their transgressions, shortcomings, or aspects of their lives. Finally, there is a possibility that a mental health worker could have an altercation with an inmate, which could threaten his or her safety. Overall, mental health workers need to be educated/knowledgable, empathetic, understanding, and helpful as far as helping inmates. There needs to be rapport and trust between mental health personnel and inmates in order to make progress, and many inmates also need referrals for housing, jobs, and substance abuse programs once they are released from jail or prison and back out in the community again. Nevertheless, I think that cross-training or collaborating with correctional agencies/staff might help mental health workers get a much better idea of how inmates behave in penal institutions and what behaviors they exhibit, which may be indicative of underlying mental illness. Perhaps correction staff can share this knowledge with mental health staff, and mental health staff can share knowledge about mental illness and effective communication with mentally ill persons with correctional staff. "
200,"Given that, “[nearly] 10% of all police contacts with the public involve persons with serious mental illnesses,” it is evident that criminal justice personnel such as police officers need specialized training when working with this vulnerable group (Watson & Fulambarker, 2012, p. 2). Besides the police, mental health providers or individuals that provide treatment services to mentally ill inmates in penal institutions should also undergo similar training given that PWMI need assistance and care during and after incarceration. Nevertheless, what typically happens to individuals suffering from severe mental illness is that they end up coming into contact with law enforcement (police officers) for some reason or another, which results in their incarceration and subsequent release back into the community. Unfortunately, many of these mentally ill persons do not receive adequate mental health treatment during incarceration as well as upon reentry into society. Even more troubling, is that some people are recycled in and out of jail or prison countless times. Therefore, training both police personnel and mental health actors is extremely important given that they both play a role in the outcomes of PWMI.             As far as educational training goes, both of these groups need to be educated on mental illness and stigma associated with it, serious mental disorders (i.e. major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, psychotic disorders, etc.), signs and symptoms of various mental disorders, and psychotropic medications and their side effects (Turner, 2019, Lecture 9-2). Moreover, both criminal justice and mental health workers should understand common or typical characteristics of mentally ill inmates that contribute to their incarceration. For example, mentally ill inmates are more likely than other inmates to have had issues with substance abuse, unemployment, homelessness, foster care placement, and past abuse (physical and sexual assault). In other words, it is imperative to realize that mentally ill offenders have a number of problems, and their behavior may result from these factors either individually or collectively. Moreover, these are the areas in which inmates may need help with during confinement (i.e. counseling, medication, GED, job skills) and when they are released (i.e. cheap housing, employment opportunities). Aside from understanding the difficulties that plague mentally ill inmates, it is"
201,"Hi Karen! Great post! I liked that you brought up how the CIT model is currently the ""best practice"" model for law enforcement personnel. Some people might argue that CIT training is not worthwhile because much more research is needed to determine whether it is actually effective, however, no harm has resulted from police departments implementing such training (Watson & Fulambarker, 2012). In fact, CIT training has been shown to ""[reduce arrests of PWMI, improve] police officers attitudes and ability to safely respond to  mental health related calls, [and] link people to mental health services"" (p. 5). Essentially, anytime a person suffering from serious mental illness is diverted away from the criminal justice system and towards the mental health system (i.e. general hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, emergency rooms, community-based services) is a ""win-win"" situation. Nevertheless, I like that you brought up the notion of a ""centralized drop-off site"" where police could bring PWMI for assessment, treatment, and possible detention (p. 3). This is critical for police officers given that they often grapple with what to do with mentally ill individuals who do not necessitate incarceration but who still require help. Finally, it is important to note correctional staff experience a high level of stress in relation to their job, which constantly places them ""at risk for violence"" (Parker, 2009, p. 644). That being said, it is important that correctional staff receive appropriate medical and mental health treatment themselves because their job can be emotionally and physically taxing depending how disruptive and unruly inmates are in certain jails and prisons. If correctional staff are anxious and stressed they may treat inmates poorly, especially those with mental illness who are perceived as ""especially troublesome."" Therefore, training or CIT training (i.e. learning about mental illness and related symptoms and negative effects; de-escalation techniques) would be incredibly beneficial for this group who interact with inmates first-hand on a regular basis. "
202,"Hi Nani! Great post! I wholeheartedly agree with you that education and communication are key for both the criminal justice and mental health systems. Unfortunately, as you mentioned, these two systems have a difficult time collaborating with one another and seeing eye to eye on things (Watson & Fulambarker, 2012, p. 5). They have also resorted to blaming one another when it comes to the issue of ""criminalization"" of the mentally ill. Nonetheless, both of these systems could benefit if they were to work together as far as responding to calls pertaining to mental health crises. For example, the textbook discusses the concept of a Mobile Crisis Team (MCT) in which mental health professionals assist law enforcement personnel during crisis situations involving PWMI (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013, p. 191, 192). Aside from possibly working together in this capacity, the criminal justice system and mental health system need to be more educated in relation to one another. For instance, police officers should learn about mental illness, negative symptoms associated with mental disorders, side effects of medications, and general struggles of mentally ill persons (i.e. substance abuse, homelessness, past trauma, prior incarceration, etc.). On the other hand, mental health workers need to understand the difficulties that arise when police officers encounter and handle PWMI. Officers need assistance with these individuals, thus hospitals, emergency rooms, and community mental health clinics should accommodate police officers when they bring mentally ill individuals for treatment. "
203,"I am assuming that jail-diversion programs such as those in Fairfax are for non-violent offenders because jails may already be inundated with inmates or at capacity. Perhaps correctional facilities may only desire to detain inmates with more serious crimes rather than to house those with mental illness who have committed minor offenses such as trespassing, loitering, petty theft, disturbing the peace, etc. Furthermore, it could be that inmates who commit less serious offenses are more amenable to treatment in comparison to those who commit serious crimes involving aggravated assault against persons or sex crimes. Nevertheless, I do think that differential treatment for mentally ill offenders based off of severity of their offense is somewhat unfair. For example, a person with schizophrenia who experiences delusions or hallucinations may commit a more serious crime as a result of their illness, yet he or she will not be able to go through a diversion program. Thus, I think that there should also be special programs for violent offenders with mental illness in jails or prisons. Perhaps they should be segregated from the rest of the inmates in the general population where they receive mental health treatment (counseling, medication) and educational sessions (i.e. substance abuse, anger management, housing, job opportunities). "
204,"I think that both the criminal justice and the mental health systems have the same goal which is to keep mentally ill persons in the community and out of the criminal justice system, however, this task has proved somewhat difficult given how many PWMI are incarcerated. Besides having this similar aim, both of these two systems face very different hurdles when it comes to PWMI and  each of them will have to implement different evidence-based practices. For example, police officers have to learn how to interact with PWMI in the community, and to know how to de-escalate a situation or where to refer these individuals for treatment. Therefore, officers have to learn, utilize, assess, and implement aspects of crisis intervention training if such tactics work effectively with mentally ill individuals. If a majority of the time, officers are able to transfer mentally ill persons to appropriate resources in the community or to manage them at the scene, then this would be an indication that something is working. Besides those who work in the criminal justice system, individuals that work in the mental health system have to successfully treat PWMI in the community so that they do not experience continual crises and subsequently coming into contact with police. In order to do this, mental health workers have to ensure that PWMI are taking their medication, going to therapy, seeking help is needed, etc. If PWMI are able to live in the community primarily on their own for a lengthy duration, then the program or intervention is proving to be effective. Thus, it is evident that both the criminal justice and mental health systems have different challenges, and each will have to resort to creating and applying different evidence-based practices. "
205,"Perhaps the criminal justice system will screen inmates differently, and also refer these individuals for various types of treatment following their discharge from jail or prison. For example, rather than just screening offenders at intake for mental illness or mental health-related problems, correctional staff might also screen for substance abuse (drugs, alcohol), which may benefit a large proportion of inmates who suffer from co-occurring disorders. While in penal facilities, inmates may receive counseling/therapy, medications, and detox treatment. Finally, upon discharge these offenders might be referred to or linked with different treatment services in the community. Either they could join an integrated treatment program that addresses both their mental illness and substance abuse at the same time, or they could go to multiple resources (i.e. psychiatrist/psychologist, group therapy, addiction program) that provided services individually considering that integrated programs are much harder to come upon. Nevertheless, perhaps police personnel and correctional staff may be more cognizant that certain offenders' behavior stems from their struggle with two major issues (mental health and substance use) that affect them adversely (i.e. cognitively, emotionally, physically) and subsequently impact their behavior. "
206,"I think peer mentoring might be helpful in addressing the stigma of mental illness because individuals who suffer from mental illness realize that there are others (i.e. peer mentors) out there that experienced mental illness and had sought help for their disorders. Thus, indicating that you have mental illness and subsequently seeking mental health services is nothing to be ashamed about or embarrassed by; especially considering how prevalent mental illness is all around the world. Clearly from the video it is apparent that peer mentoring provides assistance, help, relief, and hope for others that are suffering tremendously and are not sure where to turn to when it comes to their debilitating disorder. Therefore, I feel that peer mentoring reduces the stigma associated with mental illness because it indirectly as well as directly reveals that this problem exists, others have gone through it or are still experiencing it, and there is assistance available for people in need of it. "
207,"First and foremost, it is important to present some statistics and information pertaining to persons with mental illness residing in jails and prisons across the country. For example, the prevalence of serious mental illness among inmates is increasing, and it is reported that hundreds of thousands (356,000) of mentally ill individuals are incarcerated at any given time in the U.S. (Munetz & Teller, 2004, p. 939; Turner, 2019, Lecture 10-1). Furthermore, many inmates suffering from severe mental illness have been discovered to have co-occurring substance abuse disorders at the time of intake (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013, p. 84, 232, 254). When these two statistics are taken together, it is apparent that a large number of inmates suffer from various disorders, yet many of them do not receive any treatment services in penal facilities (Harvey & Gumport, 2015, p. 17; Slate et al., 2013, p. 237, 435, 437). Moreover, of the inmates that are treated, “[about] one in ten [receive] psychotropic medications, with one in eight [undergoing] mental health therapy or counseling” (Munetz & Teller, 2004, p. 940). Thus, mentally ill individuals entangled with the criminal justice system via incarceration lack adequate mental health treatment which includes, but is not limited to, individual counseling, group therapy, and administration of psychotropic medications. Typically, in jails or prisons these treatment needs mentioned above are provided by physicians, psychologists, and nurses, whose focus is behavioral health problems.             Nevertheless, the position paper of the American College of Physicians recommends that individuals with mental health related issues should be treated in a more wholistic manner, meaning that both their mental illness and substance abuse should be tackled in conjunction with any physical health problems they may have such as poor diet, smoking, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and social isolation from others (Crowley & Kirschner, 2015, p. 299, 300, 301). Essentially, research indicates that both mental illness and physical illness are intrinsically related such that “untreated mental illness can be incredibly harmful to overall health and wellbeing” (p. 303). In other words, when you treat someone’s mental disorder, this in turn affects his or her functioning; often improving thinking and cognition, emotional stability, and physical health. Nonetheless, the authors of the paper contend that an"
208,"Hi Nani!  Great post! I took a different approach when responding to the question and discussed how PWMI in jails and prisons would benefit if they received integrated behavioral and physical health care treatment in these particular facilities while incarcerated. Nonetheless, I liked that you brought up how an integrated approach in which behavioral health care exists within a primary care setting could very well decrease the likelihood of PWMI coming into contact with the criminal justice system, which in turn would prevent their incarceration. This is a great point to make! In essence, if persons suffering from serious mental illness were to receive both types of care during visits with primary care physicians, this would detect individuals with mental illness sooner and subsequently get them the treatment they need. Proper treatment early on is critical for PWMI, however, this could be inhibited by lack of insurance or having to pay for services out of pocket. To add to this, being seen by both types of physicians may increase costs of visits if patients are seen by two doctors instead of one. On the other hand, cross-discipline training, could address this issue considering that clinicians will be trained to manage and treat both mental health-related and physical health issues (Crowley & Kirschner, 2015). From my perspective, it seems like merging behavioral and physical health services could prove really beneficial when it comes to addressing and treating mental illness. "
209,"Hi Viviana!  Great post! It seems like integrating mental or behavioral health care (i.e. mental disorders, substance abuse disorders) and physical health care (i.e. physical disorders) would be advantageous for individuals, irrespective of whether treatment in taking place in the community or in penal facilities (Crowley & Kirschner, 2015). Both mental and physical health are linked, and it is even said that, ""mental health is the key to overall physical health"" (p. 302). In essence, addressing one without looking into the other would be a disservice to everyone, including inmates. Nevertheless,I also feel that physicians should first resort to using evidence-based psychological treatments (EBPTs) that utilize psychotherapy or ""talk therapy"" with inmates before prescribing psychotropic medications, when and if possible (Harvey & Gumport, 2015, p. 1, 4). It is reported that use of medications to treat mental health has increased dramatically, which is somewhat problematic if individuals can be treated with counseling which is not likely to lead to dependence down the line. Furthermore, excessive and continued use of psychotropic medications can be extremely costly. However, perhaps therapy could be expensive as well if you take into account how many inmates need counseling, the number of sessions they require, and the duration of sessions. Nonetheless, it might be worthwhile to use EBPTs considering that, ""[this type of treatment produces long-lasting] durable effects ... [and has] no potential for negative outcomes"" (p. 5). Thus, if both behavioral and physical health care physicians contracted to work in jails and prisons know how to effectively use treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), then inmates with mental illness in the criminal justice system will benefit greatly. "
210,"Hello Dr. Turner and fellow students, I am a student from the '18 cohort. I graduated with my bachelor's degree in Psychology in 2011 and have been working in the legal services field ever since. I discovered my interest for psychology and it's interaction with the legal world right before graduating. Once I was ready to continue my education, my search for a school that had a program tailored to this interest led me here. I do not have previous experience with this topic and I am excited to learn more about how the legal system can better interact with mentally ill individuals.  I hope that I will have a better idea of what challenges the mentally ill uniquely face when it comes to the legal system and how the research is being utilized to improve their experiences after this course. "
211,"At the very least, having adequate staff available to address the needs of mentally ill prisoners. There was also a need for oversight and follow-up by the appropriate staff/departments, as in the case of the social worker not getting completed paperwork for transfer. Finally, better protocols on the treatment of prisoners in solitary. "
212,"In the earliest communities, a belief in evil spirits was the the explanation for most PWMI and responsibility was left to the families for care. If individuals could not be cared for or controlled, group safety took precedence and that individual was banished, equating death. The belief in evil spirits also led to a belief that opening the skull would release said spirits, thus curing the person.  The Ancient Greeks and Romans took a more humanist approach and believed the mental illness to be afflictions that needed treatment, and was tied to problems with the body,  From Pre-Civil War Era up to more recent times (1960s), social standards of morality and conformity had been the main driving force behind the treatment of individuals with any behavior that did not fit within those standards, whether the person was mentally ill or not. Due to mental illness being seen as a morality issue and as something to be hidden away from ""normal society"", a lack of care and understanding was given to PWMI. Due to a wish to keep those that did not conform out of sight and ""Not In My Back Yard"", asylums were created to house and lock up anyone with vocal opposition of normative societal views (mainly women) or with an inability to control their behaviors. This did not lead to adequate care for those individuals and the hospitals/asylums were underfunded and rarely staffed with appropriate medical personnel,  as there was no desire to treat the individuals. Instead, they were involuntarily committed to keep them safe or safe from others.   "
213,"I do not think that a national registry of mentally ill persons would have benefits that outweigh the costs. The statistics show such a low percentage of PWMI that are likely to be violent and even then, they are more dangerous to themselves than to others. All a national registry would do is literally create a list of PWMI in our country. Looking at the history of national registries, I see only potential problems being created. Such lists often create more stigma for people put on them and even danger as there is often widespread knowledge in the public of who is on said list. Much like the National Registry for Sexual Offenders,  there is the opportunity for mislabeling people and thus stigmatizing them for no reason. Also like this registry, I see the potential for harm in spreading too wide a net. The potential consequences resulting in labeling people with minor mental illnesses as dangerous individuals. This type of registry could easily lead to restricting liberty of PWMI simply based on a judgement call, potentially one made by a legal professional rather than a doctor. Historically, these registries have been handled in a legal setting and I do not trust that the politics of our country would ensure proper medical input."
214,"I believe that the first and most important challenge facing PWMI is outreach and public education. I never knew until this course that the large homeless population crisis Southern California is facing can largely be traced back to this deinstitutionalization movement. While it is common knowledge that many homeless are mentally ill, I believe the public largely believes that the resources are there for those people, but they choose not to use them, due to their illness. While that may be true in some cases, this week's lectures and readings have introduced to me that the problem that needs to be fixed is people. Politicians and lawmakers need to see the importance in allocating funds to community resources and the public need to be educated on the truths of mental illness so that PWMI can have an opportunity to become gainful members of society rather than criminals. To help with this, media stories could focus on positive stories about mental illness strides, rather than the negative.  If this can be achieved, we  take steps toward solving multiple problems at once. This would reduce the number of mentally ill that interact with law enforcement as they are instead gainfully employed or otherwise engaged in beneficial activities, they are being housed instead of living on the streets and overall having less opportunities to end up in the criminal justice system. If this could be achieved, it would start a new cycle of public perception. The more the public sees PWMI as ""normal citizens"" engaged in the community, the more the fear and negative perceptions would be replaced with positive ones, and hopefully understanding. "
215,"In learning about the history of mental illness and the treatment of PWMI, I have noticed that they are always categorized into being different, no matter the time period. As said in the TedX video, society has always treated mental illness as ""us and them."" Whether it be tribal times or modern civilization, they are ostracized, humanely or not. PWMI are seen as a problem that needs to be fixed and less as a person who happens to have an illness. When all of society treats a person this way, I can imagine there is little desire to keep interacting with said society, let alone follow their rules. If no one is going to bother to care about them, why should they care about themselves? And finally, if the illness is such a problem, what is treatment going to do? They will forever be a person with a mental illness, whether managed or not.  The stigma of mental illness is a major hindrance to our society in treating both the illness and the people with the illness. At various times throughout history we have washed our hands of it one way or the other. Banishment, commitment, imprisonment. When treatment was attempted, a lack of understanding led to horrific actions or simply ignoring them to the point of abandonment. If a focus had been more on how these people are our family members and neighbors and friends that require treatment, perhaps society today would not have such an ingrained idea that PWMI are something to be either avoided or ""dealt with.""  A lack of sensitivity is clear through many of the centuries, most potently in the asylum era. Having the notion that mentally ill people are to be kept ""out of sight"" meant entire generations grew up not having any idea what a person with mental illness could really be like, or that they may well be able to be contributing citizens in our community. It is clear throughout our history and in general for human nature to treat differences as dangerous. Yet, research shows that healing comes from understanding and inclusion in social relationships, as pointed out in the TedX video. The ultimate failure of the deinstitutionalization era was a lack of introduction of society to the mentally ill population, and vice-versa. There was no mediation to help those patients that had been cared for day and night in hospitals and thus taught zero life skills but suddenly must survive on their own, and there was no call on society to rise up and help these people find their place in their communities. "
216,"I also saw that underlying trend to ignore the human being and only view the illness. Indeed that view has not changed today. Such as the video of the inmate dying in prison, only the behaviors were addressed, not the individual or the reasons behind the behaviors. It seems like quite an uphill battle knowing the human condition to ignore what is different and uncomfortable. It is hard to see people that are suffering or struggling, so we rather ignore them. Much like the RV complaint, what would have been different if those neighbors had instead asked the man and woman living in an RV if they needed anything? What if all they needed was a chance to get back on their feet? That may be a naive and simplistic view, but we cannot know without getting involved. As in the TedX video, we may be in positions to help without even realizing it. "
217,"Interesting breakdown Asia. I like how you point out that at various times society either blamed the individual or the illness. What are your thoughts on how they are viewed today? I think that today we still assign blame to the individual, if indirectly. Due to such negative connotations and a lack of understanding about the illnesses, I believe that society tends to blame the person with mental illness for not seeking treatment. As though they are burdening our society by not trying to get better. Instead of realizing the demoralizing nature and downward spiral that can be caused by the stigma of mental illness to PWMI self-determination, we only see the surface level of problems PWMI cause to us. "
218,"Since that is all the media talk about relating to gun violence, it certainly was surprising. "
219,A president can help change the stigma toward mental health by supporting laws that fund mental illness education in schools and for the public. The goal ultimately being to support developing generations that do not have the same ingrained stigmas and will instead seek treatment for themselves and those they know that may be suffering from a mental illness. 
220,"It definitely speaks to an  ignorance of the full implications of the issues in treating and dealing with mental illness, in the type of care required to effectively treat mental illness and that mental illness is not as much of a health concern as physical health care is. It also means that policymakers view the mentally ill as not as worthy of care as people suffering from physical health concerns. "
221,"In the history of the medical field and the psychiatric field, medication has sometimes been overly used as a cure-all. I would recommend trained psychologists need to be involved with the military to assess soldiers that present with PTSD symptoms. As the soldier said, a questionnaire was all that it took to diagnose him with the mental illness. That should only be a first step, and from there options on treatment should be presented, rather than automatically handing out drugs. Group therapy sessions, private therapy sessions, etc may be all that is needed to manage something like PTSD in some cases, but everyone is different. There is no one right way to treat people with mental illnesses. Without doing full interviews and background checks, there is no way to know if medication will be a good or bad path for a person. "
222,"Interestingly, I have found through this week's literature and lecture quite a similarity in how society treat PWMI and how we treat children. We assume they cannot make decisions for themselves due to a lack of insight into how to care for themselves. My recommendation for the moment would be similar to how we would treat a child. Interviews should be used case-by-case to assess the level of need for state interference and decision-making on behalf of the PWMI. If the PWMI cannot accurately describe their mental illness and the issues that go with requiring treatment, then they may lack the insight into a need for treatment at all. I believe that in order to help those with anosognosia, we need to interfere, but with high amounts of oversight and plenty of opportunities to return to society if treatment is successful. "
223,"Persons suffering from mental illness come across many disadvantages in our society. The mentally ill make up the majority of the homeless population in the U.S and often times have associated problems with substance abuse (McNiel, Binder & Robinson, 2005). If we want to address this problem, research is showing that public opinion of mental illness is the key. The negative stigma of mental illness has been allowed to increase over time. A survey in 1996 showed a likelihood of 2.5 times more than in the 1950s to associate dangerousness to the mentally ill (Rusch, Angermeyer & Corrigan, 2005). By addressing students in elementary through high school,  the hope is to stop the spread of negative stigma regarding mental health.  To stop the spread of negative stigma about mental illness, we must address two main topics: public stigma and self-stigma. We must first show the students what the stigma looks like so they can recognize it in themselves or others in society. Then, we must explain the consequences of this stigma so that they see the value in being an activist for change. To recognize the negative effects of stigma, we will address the common misconceptions created by public stigma. A lack of first-hand experience with mental illness has led to the creation of some negative stereotypes such as: persons with mental illness are inherently violent and a danger to others, that they ignore their illness and purposefully refuse treatment, and that persons with mental illnesses are generally disapproved of when persons with physical illnesses are not (Rusch, Angermeyer & Corrigan, 2005).  These negative stereotypes lead to negative beliefs about the mentally ill and consequently discriminatory behaviors. Furthermore, labeling and the language we associated with mental illness reinforce separation of persons with mental illness into their own group, a sort of ""us"" versus ""them"" mentality in society.  As a consequence of these stereotypes, persons with mental illness often experience self-stigma. Mentally ill persons may start agreeing with the negative beliefs about them and internalize the stereotypes, therefore resulting in low self-esteem and a lack of desire to seek treatment. Label avoidance is another reason persons with mental illness may want to avoid seeking treatment as they do not want to be separated from ""normal"" society and lumped into an ""other"" group. Many tend to self-medicate instead, leading to substance abuse"
224,"I love this breakdown by school level. I agree that it would be very beneficial to begin the discussion about what mental disorders are in junior high. That is the time that children are really starting to observe the differences in the populations and try to see how they fit into the world. Further information in high school may help them identify signs in themselves or others and open avenues for earlier treatment. Early treatment often leads to better outcomes for PWMI, and hopefully less stigma if kids know more of their peers that successfully live with mental illness. "
225,"Great points about open sharing among students. I think it would be extremely beneficial to share experiences so that kids see just how many people experience these issues and that it is far more normal than not. Doing this early on in education with mental illness, as we have done with the changing family structures, makes them far more common-place experiences for children. As seen from history, the trouble really stems from a lack of personal experience with people suffering from mental illness, so society treats them as unknowns. People intrinsically fear the unknown, associating negative stigma and fear. Early introduction can definitely stop these fears from developing. "
226,"In terms of civil commitment, sensitivity and specificity of our practices can have life-changing effects. If we make our laws more sensitive, so that many people qualify for civil commitment, it would mean that we trust our current mental health system to receive these people and accurately diagnose the mentally ill and release the non-mentally ill after initial interviews. It would also increase costs as the system would have to process many more individuals. Lastly, it would run the risk of many false positives in diagnosing and committing individuals that actually do not have a mental illness. As our system is not perfect, this is a highly likely scenario and would create multitudes of issues for those individuals related to last week's material about stigma and societal fallout of being labeled with a mental illness.  However, by increasing the specificity, we narrow the qualifications for commitment and do the opposite. In this case we would risk missing individuals with serious mental health problems that may not immediately present as dangerous to themselves or others. That risks both the individual's well-being and possibly the safety of the public if their future dangerous behavior is not deterred. "
227,"The debate over involuntary commitment of sex offenders after serving their prison sentence comes down to how we define sexual predatory behavior. Do we consider sex offenders as mentally ill? If we are going to use the civil commitment laws to involuntarily commit them, then all requirements must be met. As the video discussed, research shows that treatment can be effective for these types of offenders. Therefore, I think it is a good idea, but with many of the adjustments discussed in the video. The involuntary commitment should be tailored to the treatment of sexually violent predators and this should be helped by improving the classification of this mental illness. The facilities in which they are housed also need to be appropriate to what constitutes a treatment facility and not another prison, so that we follow  the true intentions of the civil commitment standard of treatment for individuals which are a danger to others. "
228,"I consider inpatient commitment to be a further reach of state authority because, even for the betterment of the person, the individual is being removed from the community, their home and daily life, to be placed in a hospital for an indefinite amount of time. This interrupts any employment, social obligations, and life goals that the individual may have been engaged in. Their life effectively is interrupted until the mental illness symptoms can be controlled and the person can return to said life. With outpatient commitment, the individual is not remanded to the care of a hospital and can immediately return to their community and daily life. OC also allows for a combining of the mental illness treatment into their life and routines, rather than interrupting their life in order to treat the illness.  This allows for continued employment, interaction with friends and family and for their life to keep moving forward overall. "
229,"The issue of handling PWMI that either cannot care for themselves or present an imminent threat does not have an easy solution. In response, modern society has developed the solution of civil commitment with two options that offer treatment but also create their own problems. The first option is to hospitalize the mentally ill, otherwise know as inpatient commitment. A PWMI is forcibly removed from society by court order and remanded to a hospital’s care for an indeterminant time for treatment (Risdon, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013). Guidelines exist per state as to when this step is allowable to take, such as grave disability (inability to care for basic needs) or dangerousness to self or others (Burley & Morris, 2015). The second option is outpatient civil commitment, or community-based care, in which an individual is ordered by the court to follow a treatment plan with a mental-health organization in their community. This usually involves required attendance at therapy, possible forced medication, possible regular blood tests, and/or living in a supervised community facility (Risdon, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013). The main difference between these is the freedom afforded to individuals by outpatient treatment programs that allow for their regular lives to continue rather than be interrupted by a hospital stay. The answer to the main question of which option is best to use has multiple parts. We must consider the success of each option against their drawbacks. Measuring this accurately can be difficult. There is always the chance of a false positive (committing someone that does not need to be) or false negative (missing an individual that is actually in need of care). I believe that to appropriately measure these options for treatment, the pros must outweigh the cons. Treatment must be effective without being invasive. This is where balancing the needs of the individual and the needs of society come into play. Inpatient treatment was the first answer to deinstitutionalization and the sudden need for emergency handling of PWMI. Hospitalization removes the danger of the individual to society or themselves and gives round-the-clock care to the individual. However, it is also coercive, anti-therapeutic, stigmatizing, and disruptive in the individual’s life(Risdon, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013). It removes the individual’s liberties for the “greater good” of bettering their lives. However, this forced care"
230,"Great summary of the topic! I like how you point out that each type of care can be an indication of how the other one is doing, successful or not, in it's goals. If inpatient is successful, then the patient should be transitioned into outpatient care and if not returned to inpatient lock-down care. If outpatient care is not successful, then the patient must go to inpatient, so keeping individuals out of inpatient would be a success for outpatient care. I also agreed that inpatient care should be reserved for acute cases and everyone can receive more adjustable care through outpatient treatment."
231,"Hi Jennifer,  Great summation of the two commitment options. I also found that the best measure of success for inpatient was to reduce the use to imminent threat only. In a study I found, those admitted at risk of suicide were less likely to return. Those admitted due to complications from a severe mental illness were more likely to return. To me, this study highlights the main problem in our courts. Outpatient care should be the first go to, not the second, or not even considered, in some cases. Inpatient care should be for law enforcement, care team members, family, friends, etc to use for those in imminent danger of harming themselves or others. PWMI with long-term mental illness that need constant care should really fall into outpatient treatment programs so they can learn how to manage it themselves without deteriorating. Sometime this requires forcing them into the treatment, but as studies show, it really would be for their greater good, without depriving them of their freedom. "
232,"Hi Dr. Turner,  I am not familiar with using Zoom to record, but do use Zoom frequently for video-conference at work. I am familiar with PowerPoint, but have not used it in several years as I have been out of school for a while now. "
233,"I believe the most difficult to navigate for PWMI would be the Prosecution & Pre-Trial services followed by the Adjudication. These steps require the most knowledge about the legal system. In these steps, the defendant must make life-changing decisions regarding their case, such as to plead guilty or not-guilty and whether they should accept a plea deal or not. These steps also involve the most interactions with judges and other court personnel, which is the most unfamiliar area for most citizens, even those without mental illness. "
234,"This shift of responsibility for felons would benefit PWMI because local parole/probation services are better equipped to help both those and those without mental illness than state-run services. This is because there is better communication with local agencies that can service and aid these individuals than there are at state levels. However, this does not benefit PWMI because over-crowding and the reallocation of felony prisoners means that the county jails now hold prisoners for longer sentences, so PWMI that are arrested for minor charges are less likely to see any jail time. This may seem like a benefit, but with a lack of access to any other type of care, they are also now getting put back on the streets rather than receiving even the limited care they would get from the jail system. "
235,"I believe that is fair. While many police officers may get into the the field because they want to be ""crime fighters,"" the reality is that they are community support for dangerous situations. Police officers are specifically trained to be the people that respond to violent, dangerous situations. Sometimes that means responding to domestic situations, or a bank robbery, or someone threatening to harm themselves or others. The fact is, this last occurrence can often involve PWMI due to the very nature of their illness. As the video stated, training in de-escalating crises situations is the very nature of their jobs. While not every officer may be suited to working with PWMI in crisis, there should be some that are. As the situation is unavoidable, the combination of training with/on weapons, training on high-stress, dangerous situations should go hand-in-hand with crisis training involving individuals that are not within their right state of mind. That way, the community can rely on calling on the police for help regardless of the situation. Once called, the police can de-escalate the immediate danger and crisis, then hand over responsibility of care to the proper mental health personnel for more long-term assistance. It just does not make sense to me that if a citizen sees an individual waving a knife around in a store, that citzen would need to assess the mental state of the person to determine who to call. It is more logical that the citizen sees a dangerous or potentially dangerous situation and they call the police. As we have all been trained to do since childhood. "
236,"CIT training is beneficial to reducing stigma of mental illness because it increases knowledge about mental illness signs and symptoms, debunks common myths about PWMI being violent and general incapable of calming down or listening to authority figures when in crisis, and gives police personnel opportunities to interact with both family members and consumers of mental health care directly, where many of those officers may have not had any connection to the mental health world before. "
237,"CIT programs are still fairly new. The original program developed in Memphis has only been operating for a few decades. It follows then that the research into the effectiveness of such programs is still in its infancy, as are many of the subsequent implementations of the program in other states. According to Taheri’s meta-analysis (2016) there has not been significant findings that the CIT programs are reducing arrests, injuries, or use of force. There have also not been sufficient findings of increased harm to PWMI where these programs are implemented (Taheri, 2016). However, this meta-analysis only focused on those three attributes of the CIT program’s goals. While this is important research to follow, there are other benefits of the CIT program that were not analyzed. It is these other benefits and the lack of increased risk of harm that lead me to believe that the continued use and implementation of the CIT programs should continue and be expanded to all states. The reduction in stigma of PWMI through the training provided by CIT programs should not be undervalued. These programs offer opportunities to interact with PWMI and families of PWMI, to hear their version of police encounters and how they were affected, as well as debunk common myths and misperceptions (Risdon, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013). Personalizing PWMI to the officers and giving back the humanity to a previously stigmatized view increases the empathy of the officers, which is a vital aspect to successful interactions with PWMI in crisis (Lecture 4-4 video: Fox9 – A Softer Shade of Blue). Establishing CIT programs involves ensuring that there are properly established mental health organizations for the officers to collaborate with. As there has historically been under-funding and over-ignored attitudes toward community mental health organizations by policymakers and the general public, these programs force greater attention to establishing these care facilities. In order for CIT programs to be most effective, 24/7 drop off centers must be available to the officers (Risdon, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013). These programs mean that more PWMI will be receiving at least some form of care without having to be put into the criminal justice system to get it. While an increased cost may be associated with implementing the programs, the cost-savings of courts and prisons should offset those costs. Finally, increased confidence and affirmations by poli"
238,Great recommendations Caroline. I also thought that the service codes were a great implementation to increase response time of the CIT trained officers. Would you also want to see increased training involving the mental health system? Perhaps not for the officers specifically but for the superiors in the departments and in the government so the officers get the much-needed support from the public sector in the ability to quickly get people in crisis to the professionals that can help them long-term. 
239,"Bobbie, great thoughts on ways to increase valid data for research. I like the idea of creating a group of experienced CIT officers that would move to a training role and just go to other counties to create tailored programs. Perhaps by having a set group create and implement the programs, we would decrease the amount of states that have degrees of the CIT program without achieving the full version. Perhaps even a research/marketing group to go along and garner support from the local government and community to fund and establish the necessary networks between law enforcement and the local mental health services. Such help is pivotal to successful CIT programs. "
240,"I would imagine it becomes so much the norm, they just expect it to be part of their routine of living. They must expect to return to that jail just because they have no other choice. Perhaps even if they did not want to return, they know it is unavoidable. They are not given any other places to go once released and they probably know that due to their illness and living situation, they will commit another act that sends them right back. They may even do it on purpose for food and shelter. "
241,"1. Jails should measure the number of times the same inmates return to jails. This would indicate that community mental health resources are not reaching their targeted community of those in need of those services. It would also show how resources could be saved if those community services successfully kept individuals from returning to jails.  2. Jails should measure the number of inmates receiving treatment for mental illness and what offenses they were arrested for. This would indicate how the courts could redirect those individuals with a history of similar crimes at the sentencing phase to avoid jails and instead direct them to mental health treatment services.  3. Jails should also measure of treatment care and improvement of PWMI during their jail stays. This would indicate if the jails are really just temporary holding centers for the mentally ill that get arrested or if PWMI that are sent to jail actually improve because of their time there. If there is no improvement for the inmate, then there is no reason to keep sending these individuals to jail. This can be tied with recidivism rates of the same inmates. "
242,"I believe they are afforded too few rights. They are afforded all the basic constitutional rights that we are, yet they are not allowed to vote in elections. While they are imprisoned, they have no ability to affect how the country they live in is run or to chose the politicians that make the policies affecting the prisons and jails they are housed in. There should be additional rights to information and counseling on aid and services available in their communities and discharge plans should be a mandatory right for every prisoner, not just the mentally ill. While prisoners have broken the law, every person should be given the tools to make better choices. If they choose to ignore them, then they might return to prison, but at least the state did whatever possible to rehabilitate them, not just punish them. "
243,"Medication is the most common form of treatment for PWMI in jails because it is the most efficient and universal form of treatment available. Jails often do not have the staff to create individualized treatment plans, or the budget to staff multiple psychiatrists to create said plans. Any other form of treatment, such as counseling, is time-consuming and not adaptable to handle many patients at one time. It also allows jails to meet the minimum requirement of providing treatment with the least amount of resources used to do so."
244,"Jails are supremely inappropriate to use for housing and treating seriously mentally ill individuals. Jails are inherently short-term. They are a mash up of many different kinds of individuals being housed for various misdemeanors and felonies with varying lengths of terms. Seeing as nationwide jails book over 12 million individuals a year and 62% of them turn over each week, specialized care for PWMI is not realistic in this setting (Risdon, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013). Jails also handle PWMI that are at their most volatile and often need crisis intervention treatment, even though most jails are not equipped with the staff or training to implement this (Risdon, et al, 2013). Let alone, the proper funding to handle this magnitude of PWMI being processed. County jails are notoriously underfunded compared to state prisons and can vary in their capacity depending on the size of their county (Risdon, et al, 2013). In California, recent policy reform changes have also affected who is housed in jails and who actually makes it into jail in the first place. PWMI are often kept in jails longer on average than inmates without a mental illness. This is because PWMI often do not cope well in the jail setting and end up getting additional time for rule violations, bad behavior, etc. This is not fair to PWMI as the very setting of jails is not conducive for them. Many PWMI are sensitive to sensory stimulation, like the lights always staying on, trauma of the intake process (e.g. strip search), victimization by other inmates, and a general lack of ability to comprehend and comply with commands by jail personnel. Isolation and segregation are often used either to deal with exceptionally difficult individuals or to protect them from other inmates. However, this type of sensory deprivation can be extremely harmful to PWMI and lead to higher risk of suicide and deterioration of the individual’s mental state (Risdon, et al, 2013). In California, PWMI are at a higher risk of experiencing abuse from inmates as state prisoners are reallocated into county jails (Lofstrom, Bird & Martin, 2016). Jail personnel themselves can often be the problem as well. Jail staff are not hired to be caretakers of mentally ill individuals and are not expected to have said skills (Torrey, Kennard, Eslinger, Lamb & Pavle, 2010). Finally, a lack of beds in the community hospitals and treatment facilities mean jails become waiting rooms for the mentally ill, a role for w"
245,"Alyse,  Great points about realignment affecting the jail populations. I had not thought about how the reallocation would send down mentally ill prisoners from the state prisons and only add more PWMI into jails, thus stretching already limited resources. In addition to the increased numbers, both the PWMI and the reallocated prisoners will be there for longer stays together. I also wondered about realignment and Prop 47. Would you think PWMI are better off getting substandard treatment than none at all? It is quite a tricky question considering the treatment they do get does not seem to stick going by recidivism rates. "
246,"Suzanna,  Great points about the overcrowding due to realignment. This helped me realize that while the growing rates of incarcerated led to more social awareness and a call to reduce the prison populations in CA, I doubt anyone realized it would severely affect already limited care PWMI were getting at the jail levels. This must have been incredibly stressful for both the staff and the inmates with mental illnesses, and I cannot imagine any successful treatment coming from that experience. As pointed out by Torrey, et al (2010), staff would sometimes resort to violence against inmates to get PWMI inmates to follow directions and behave in a manageable way. This seems quite ironic since the reduction in the prison population was to help prevent this treatment from happening.  "
247,"I do believe it is fair because all parties that are using these tools are aware that said assessment is just a starting point. The assessment is a tool for the judge and other justice parties to get a summarized view of the person they are interacting with so that their judgment of that individual can have some context. At the same time, because these assessments are just a piece of the information, the attorneys can object and make clarifications, etc. In this way, everyone is more informed and will hopefully make decisions based more on evidence than instinct, as was more likely the case without a risk assessment. "
248,"I believe mental health professionals would be very receptive to this approach. Previous instruction I have received in this area pointed out how difficult it is for the doctors at inpatient treatment centers and psychiatric hospitals to determine whether the patients that are brought to them are suffering from drug symptoms or mental illness. They must wait for the drug effects, if there are any, to wear off before they can start treating the patient, making for longer holds of individuals in already crowded facilities. By addressing the factors that probably caused the crime more than the mental illness, the justice system can then apply the proper punishment for the crime, while also helping to treat the root cause and reduce the likelihood the individual would return to the system. Mental health professionals can then be concerned with employment, housing and establishing regular treatment for substance abuse and their mental illness to get the PWMI more stabilized over all in the community. "
249,"I do not think that probation is set up in a way that it can effectively help PWMI with the specific and unique challenges they face in returning to the community and changing their behavior and lives to reduce the risk of recidivism. However, the very nature of probation with the goals of rehabilitation and change, are a far better approach to working with PWMI offenders than jail is. As research has shown, jail will simply medicate PWMI and then release them. With probation, there is at least an officer creating a plan for that individual, working to try to establish housing and employment for that individual as well as medical benefits. So for some, that may be enough to help them get on a better path, although it lacks an element of therapy and management skills for dealing with mental illness symptoms in everyday life so that they do not get de-escalate back to the factors that caused them to offend and get on probation. "
250,"On one hand, I think I would be glad to get to stay out of jail and return to the community. On the other hand, the sanctions and conditions being placed on me would probably feel a bit overwhelming. If I had come from perhaps being homeless and not really following any kind of routine, whether that be medication compliance routines, reporting to someone on a regular basis, and following other responsibilities such as attending therapy sessions, etc, that would seem like too much to be responsible for. Those conditions could very easily feel like my liberty to live my life how I choose was being taken away. On the other hand, if I had been committing criminal acts just to eat or to buy drugs, it may come as a relief to be told that I will have someone working with me all the time to get services that will give me aid in my day-to-day life. "
251,"Recent changes in the attitudes toward treatment of PWMI in the criminal justice system and efforts to reduce the numbers of mentally ill individuals housed in prisons and jails has led to diversion tactics for PWMI being processed in the criminal justice system. One of those is the use of Mental Health Courts, which more often divert PWMI to probation rather than jail time (Skeem, Manchak & Montoya, 2017). In recommending appropriate steps for handling PWMI entering the probation program, it is necessary to focus on the special consideration of both the reason PWMI offend and how their mental illness may increase this likelihood. Addressing the needs of PWMI in the criminal justice system is not an easy task. To date, the main aspect thought necessary to control have been the symptoms of mental illness such that a positive change in the management of their illness would lead to reduced involvement in the criminal justice system (Peterson, Skeem, Kennealy, Bray & Zvonkovic, 2014). While this is certainly an important aspect to their wellbeing, it has come to light that it may not be the most important aspect. Researchers set out to determine if this approach was successful and found that symptoms of mental illness typically did not directly cause an individual to offend. Peterson, Skeem, Kennealy, Bray and Zvonkovic (2014) found that only 4% of 429 coded crimes were committed as a direct result of psychosis, 3% resulting from depression, and 10% resulting from bipolar disorder. In response to such findings, a new approach of applying the “R-N-R” model of treatment not just to regular offenders, but also may be useful to reduce the recycling of PWMI offenders. This model assesses the “Risks” offenders face that play important roles leading up to committing an offense, such as antisocial traits, along with the “Needs” to reduce those risks and then the subsequent “Responsivity” of judicial and law enforcement parties in order to see reduced recidivism (Skeem, Steadman & Manchak, 2015). It is therefore recommended that probation departments incorporate both treatments plans for the reinstatement of mental health along with a cognitive behavioral therapy plan that addresses the specific risks the offender may be facing, both of which could lead to recidivism.  Probation officers are already well-suited to provide the needs-based assistance that is proven to help reduce re-arrests and address the “Central Eight” risk factors for r"
252,"Hi Caroline,  I like that you made recommendations for the budget and the staff on these probation teams that would be better suited to handle PWMI on probation. Having professionally trained psychologists on staff would definitely help with training officers in handling mentally ill offenders and how to create individualized treatment plans. What would you recommend be the appropriate models used by these staff? Would cognitive behavioral therapies be best or focusing on medication and mental illness management? Would either or both be effective to reducing both violence and recidivism?"
253,"Hi Bobbi,  Excellent post and very well-rounded. I specifically like your suggestion that the CPO look at the local population pf PWMI under his jurisdiction. This can definitely assist in the training of the CPO's officers to create individualized plans. I also like that you address the research findings that models like the RNR approach have not been found to statistically increase public safety, but that by reducing recidivism, we can achieve the same result. I think that is an important point in thinking of these programs from  a policy standpoint, and why it is so important to look at the costs associated with these specialized caseloads. It may seem like more money used to provide the staffing, but overall cost savings are significant when you look at the big picture. Just like that, reducing recidivism of PWMI makes the community safer by reducing the likelihood of future crimes being committed. "
254,"The environment of a prison is not suited for PWMI first because of the strict rules and inherent loneliness. These inmates behaviors can often be unpredictable and uncontrollable, yet expectations are placed upon them that they cannot reach and are therefore punished for. These symptoms can often get worse when these inmates must find a way to go through countless hours on their own or with nothing to do. Secondly, the environment of a place  is created by the people within that place and prison are filled with other inmates that have antisocial tendencies and trouble forming healthy relationships. Finally, they are often overstimulating for PWMI as they are loud, brightly lit, and lacking in people that properly know how to handle/treat them. "
255,"I believe it is possible, but extremely hard to do as it requires quite a lot of resources being expended on just a few inmates at a time. It really requires personalized treatment plans, medications, regular follow-up, skills training, and an overall re-training of behaviors and mental processes. This is time-consuming work, plus the inmate has to be on board and willing to make changes to themselves. Therefore, current prisons are not the ideal place for rehabilitation, but you do have the opportunity of working with these people in a controlled environment where the stress of everyday responsibilities may hinder or stop rehabilitative progress. With a lot more resources and staff, it could become a place where a person with mental illness could learn how to take care of themselves to the degree that they want to stay healthy and manage their illness. However, we are a long way off from making this this possible on large scale across prisons. "
256,"There definitely needs to be a balance between security and mental health of inmates in prisons. It does no good to create even more issues in inmates by keeping them in solitary for years at a time and destroying what mental stability they had before then. Once released, they would only cause the prison staff more problems with maladjustment problems. Research has proven that human interaction is essential for human health and well-being. There are so many advances in technology today, couldn't we find a way to keep the prisoners confined, but still get to have more human interaction than 23 hours a day alone? If we could create clear walls, or give multiple breaks in the day instead of just one, that alone would help. We could also find other ways to maintain the distance of these ""dangerous"" inmates without starving their minds of activity. It is essential that prisons maintain their order and prioritize safety of all inmates, but at the cost of the few in solitary? That is still doing a disservice to those inmates by punishing them twice. First with being locked away alone, then also by locking their minds away. "
257,"We certainly cannot ignore the treatment of the mentally ill in the prisons currently, so I do agree that money should be put toward that end. However, I would want this to be a temporary rise. I would expect my city to also be investing in community mental health care so that the prisons are not saddled with such high costs of caring for the mentally ill that end up being incarcerated. By investing in the community, the number of PWMI in prisons would go down and so would the prisons budgets so that steadily even more money could be provided to community mental health care. I would also want the tax dollars I pay be going to prison reform that actually reform the mentally ill, such as the programs discussed in earlier videos that teach life skills and help find housing, etc to stabilize parolees. "
258,"There is no easy answer to balancing inmate treatment with the safety and security of prison staff and inmates. The best solution I can see from research findings is to segregate the severely mentally ill into their own treatment units. Preferably, prisons would have a designated ward just for mentally ill inmates. As I will discuss further below, this would decrease occurrences of violent incidents among inmates, decrease the risk and occurrence of violence committed upon the vulnerable population of mentally ill inmates, and allow for increased treatment opportunities (Adams & Ferrandino, 2008). Finally, increased mental health training to staff working those units and simplified training to all staff would allow for better management of inmates. While keeping costs low is a necessary consideration for prison administration, how their budget is allocated can have major impacts on the overall security and safety of the prison. It may seem counter intuitive, but allocating more resources to treating the mentally ill will serve to create a more controlled and safe prison environment overall. By housing the severely mentally ill in their own unit, the risk of violence is decreased because triggering events are less likely to happen (Adams & Ferradino, 2008). The mentally ill inmates are less likely to act out because of stressful environments and non-mentally ill inmates are less likely to retaliate against a mentally-ill inmate’s behavior they do not understand. Furthermore, by segregating mentally-ill inmates from the general population the prison can employ therapeutic techniques that have been gaining ground as quite successful in other fields such as substance abuse, a common comorbidity diagnosis for inmates with mental illness (Adams & Ferrandino, 2008). Therapeutic communities give the mentally-ill inmates less stressful, more free environments for them to interact in and thus improve their prosocial skills. An eventual goal could be to manage the mental illness in this environment until the inmate is stable enough to try the improved skills with the general population, almost as a prep period for being released back into the community at large. Ideally, this type of separate unit would also allow for more close monitoring by staff and thus a reduction in suicides and self-injurious behaviors. Prison staff are the first line of defense for these as they are monitoring the inmates 24 hours a day (Adams & Ferrandino,"
259,"Nani,  Great post! Thanks for including all the budgetary numbers as that was very impactful to see just how much treating PWMI in prisons cost. I am always terrible about including that kind of data. I completely agree that we would save so much more money if we just properly treat the mentally ill in that are imprisoned. I think that what those executives are not seeing are the extended sentences, increased recidivism of those inmates that they had a chance of treating but didn't. I also agreed that segregated housing would be the best chance to keep the needed security of all inmates and staff, while allowing for more therapeutic interactions for PWMI inmates. I especially liked the idea of therapeutic communities that would be formed by doing this, where the mentally -ill are not faced with the constant stress of the general population social interaction they are often not equipped to deal with. "
260,"Vivianna,  Great post. Thank you for going outside of our lecture and finding information on the policies of other nations in handling their prisoners, that is so interesting. I think it definitely applies to how the US should be reevaluating our prison system, especially considering we have the highest incarceration rates in the world. Clearly, something is not working. It is also interesting that you focused on the hiring of staff. It was made clear in our readings that correctional officers are a vital part of changing treatment of inmates as they are the main interactions inmates have. A complete overhaul in training and mentality of CO would be helpful for treatment, but I know that prison executives and legislatures in this country would also want to be assured of the security and safety side. I definitely think more studies into the safety of other nations prisons, like Norway, could help with that aspect and hopefully show that by giving trust, you get it back as well in the form of less rule breaking, etc. I would be interested in seeing that data!"
261,"I would be concerned that so much funding went into one project, but it would also be a relief to have some answer to the growing number of homeless mentally ill on the streets. If I were to address this video without all my knowledge gained from this class, I might very well see it as a waste of resources when there is already a building to use. At the same time, thinking about the stigma's most people have about the mentally ill, there might be support for it as a way of getting the ""dangerous mentally ill"" in a safe place for them and the community. Regardless, as a taxpayer it would be putting money toward rehabilitation so if I supported the treatment of the more vulnerable in our population, it would definitely be a good thing, though I am sure there would be others that find it a waste of resources that should be put toward more community mental health support. "
262,"Definitely not as being found NGRI does not make an individual any less dangerous. They still committed a crime, so they are not going to be set free back out into the community. Instead, the individual will be treated for said insanity at a mental hospital until they are fit to be released again, as deemed so by a judge. However, imagine the public outcry if a judge released an individual that was found NGRI at one time, and they committed another crime. Therefore, NGRI individuals typically serve a life sentence in the hospital, instead of jail. "
263,"Balancing safety and treatment is really difficult. The only thing I can think of to help keep staff and patients staff, especially when there may not be enough staff to go around, is to treat the especially violent patients one-on-one. They should be receiving treatment on their own so that there can be enough staff to safely handle violent episodes without the staff also having to worry about other patients that might be in harm's way. If treatment is successful and the violent episodes reduce enough, group therapy could then be an option. Otherwise, group interactions should only happen when there is enough staff to monitor the situation safely. However, for those patient's safety and treatment, there still needs to be regular interaction with the staff and doctors throughout the day and not just sequester them away for hours on end.  Perhaps also studying more in depth into the triggers of these patients and what situations tend to make them violent so that extra staff can be prepared if treatment or activities are necessary but are also likely to cause the patient to be violent. "
264,"I think that it is a revolutionary technique. It is not that different from what medication strives for, which is altering the chemistry of our body, or the signals the brain puts out or receives, in order to improve or correct it's functioning. This is just a much more direct and targeted way to do the same thing. If it can transform someone who sees no point in living anyway, why not try something drastic that may give them their life back. Our emotions stem from the brain, so if there is a dysfunction in our brain processing our world, then correction is needed. More study is absolutely needed and hopefully learning more about this technique will help us understand what is going wrong for people with disorders and improve all forms of therapeutic interventions. "
265,"The role of state hospitals for mentally ill individuals in our country has shifted dramatically over the long history of state mental hospital existence. At one time a life-saving option in the 19 th century when before there had been little to no treatment options at all. They moved to being associated with abuse, overcrowding, and abandonment of the mentally ill in the community in the early 20 th Century (Sisti, Segal, & Emanual, 2015). Today they are seen as costly and burdensome to maintain when there are seemingly better outpatient options for treatment (Fisher, Geller & Pandiani, 2009). What many may not realize is that 90% of the patients in state hospitals today are funneled there by the criminal justice system, and only 10% are there by civil commitment. These are often long-term patients that are not fit for the prison system or are not fit to return to the community after their prison term. This is a complete reversal of the state hospital role from the 19 th and 20 th centuries. However, there is no additional funding for taking on this role in the community and less flexibility in decisions about discharge due to court involvement (Fisher, Geller & Pandiani, 2009.) I do believe that state hospitals are the only remaining place that is suitable to handle these individuals. While there needs to be major policy changes regarding funding and regulations for the partnership between the hospitals and the courts in decision-making functions, there is no better place to house these individuals that currently exists. State hospitals are the most adequate in terms of resources and facilities, treatment options, and therapeutic environments for these individuals that must be housed somewhere. If they are too dangerous for the community at large, such as sexually-violent predators and violent offenders with a mental disorder, then outpatient treatment options are not suitable and many have already served a prison sentence. If they are too incapacitated by their mental illness to care for themselves or to likely recover from their illness fully, then outpatient treatment and prison are not suitable. Finally, many need a suitable place to be safely treated in order to be returned to mental competence to stand trial. Research has shown that jails and prisons are antitherapeutic environments, so the likelihood that an individual would ever recover enough to be competent is reduced, increasing th"
266,"Caroline,  Great post, thanks for that detailed information about patient's rights. That makes it even more clear how inappropriate jail/prison is for mentally-ill individuals. Even those jails that have offshoots from the state hospitals to house transitional patients waiting for trial, etc. should not really exist. Jails/prisons are wholly in-equipped to meet these conditions, and the officer training is in complete opposition to these requirements. I agree that state hospitals exclusively should be the facilities that houses forensic patients. I thought that there could be consolidation such as suggested by Fisher, Geller & Pandiani (2009) that could accommodate both forensic and civil commitment patients if proper facilities were built. The same type of care is required regardless of how the patient got there, and state hospitals are the best setup without such heavy financial burdens as private institutions. "
267,"Liisa,  I love your perspective of the problem the innovative suggestion. It is certainly an idea that could yield excellent results. I agree that those found incompetent to stand trial may simply need a stable treatment and medication period, while treating subsequent disorders such as substance abuse, to be returned to a mentally competent state and having a separate institution that also gave legal knowledge for these individuals may be beneficial and cost-effective over housing them with other longer-term patients that require more attention. I had though consolidating all in state hospitals would be effective, but your suggestion gives me another point-of view to consider. "
268,"These suggestions are definitely a major step forward. Things like linking inmates to their psychiatrist just by sharing data between organizations and at the same time making the jails fully aware of the needs of that inmate. Without implementing these suggestions it is hard to know what would improve them t this point, but we would ant to make sure that proper ethical and legal restrictions are followed at all times. Oversharing then could be dangerous. "
269,"There is a lot more communication about helping the individual that gives specific details. The officer still got necessary information from the individual, but instead of having to use force to get the individual to the hospital, he was able to convince him to voluntarily go with them. There was understanding and acknowledgement from the officers of the distress that the individual was feeling in order to establish trust. The officers took their time talking with the individual , giving details about help options that can be provided to the person so that they know they can get long-term help. The officer also repeated back every issue the individual said so that they acknowledge the person is being heard. All these are de-escalation techniques that get better results than demanding that a person calm down or come with them. "
270,"I believe it is because active change requires money, and the budgets of most jails and prisons are already strained. Unless it becomes a priority situation where a court order has been implemented or public outcry calls for it, they do not rock the boat and keep towing the standard line. It is easier, less costly and more comfortable to keep the status quo. They also may not think that they have been doing anything wrong. If the staff and administration see an unfixable problem, they may just assume we have to do things the hard way with those inmates. If nothing else they have tried seems to work, then they may feel they are doing all they can. It requires an interest in keeping up with the latest research and literature of the field to know there may be better techniques. "
271,"Correctional staff may not see the importance of the mental health workers goals for the inmates. Without some training of the staff into why the techniques the MH workers are using are helpful, they may dismiss them. The first goal of correctional staff is safety and maintaining control, so anything they think may undermine that will not be liked. It is important that the safety of all is considered inside a prison, so they two sets of workers may have difficulty meeting in the middle at times. Cross-training would help the correctional staff have some context into the goals of the mental health workers and help the two teams work together to find new ways to meet those goals that accommodate both sides. "
272,"I believe the most essential training is for police officers in the model of CIT program. As it was described in the article by Watson and Fumalbarker (2012), this ""front-door approach"" is essential to stemming the flow of mentally ill into the criminal justice system. While it is important that correctional staff get proper training, if police officers can prevent a crisis situation from turning into offending behavior, then we can prevent the criminalization of so many mentally ill individuals. The CIT training model for police officers is also important because it requires a joint effort with mental health workers and resources. Without the collaboration, the program would be useless, so if cities want to show that they are making strides in helping police in their role as community support, then they must pour resources into these mental health facilities. Not all jurisdictions have established a good relationship with community resources, and we can see the results being less effective than cities with good working relationships.  Furthermore, these programs help police officers de-escalate all situations, even if they do not involve mentally ill individuals. Sometimes, they can just assist distressed individuals that have been in an accident, family members of an agitated individual, victims of crimes, etc to get help dealing with stressful situations. By calming down everyone at a scene, police officers have prevented possible crises before they start, and helped more people at once. In their role as the authority of a situation, it is important that they be able to read a situation and properly handle the people involved to keep everyone safe, including themselves.  While the data of the success of these CIT programs is still being gathered, there are promising reviews and support coming from the officers themselves, state governments, and PWMI and their families that have been helped by the officers. The officers feel more confident in handling PWMI they may encounter and feel that the situations are less dangerous than they may have thought before CIT training. Overall, if more PWMI can be connected with services before becoming entrapped in the criminal justice system, then more people have a chance to improve their lives. This is made much harder once an individual has been incarcerated in this country, so it is vital we do all we can to avoid incarceration unless absolutely necessary. PWMI should not have to reach the correc"
273,"Great post Liisa, very well summarized of the benefits of training for all. I wonder which you think is most important? I found that CIT trainging of officers is the most beneficial to PWMI because this allows them to get a better path of treatment and improved living without even having to touch the correctional system. While the work NAMI is doing to improve prisoners treatment is vital as at least 16% of inmates are currently suffering from a severe mental illness, we should be actively working to prevent the incorporation of more individuals into the cycle of incarceration. "
274,"Sayla,  good work pointing out the benefits of training to all. I had not given as much thought to the benefits that mental health workers can get from training in what the officers and court personnel are dealing with when interacting with PWMI. More training of mental health workers can help them see the frustration and hesititation officers feel in handling PWMI if their training has not been sufficient. Equally, officers should be aware that mental health workers have specific goals when working with PWMI, and knowing those can help the officers to give adequate assistance in allowing those goals to be achieved. This overall benefits PWMI the most. "
275,"I think it is a safety measure because they are essentially diverting the individual away from jail/prison time and releasing them back into the community for treatment. If the individual had committed a violent crime and was released back into the community, then committed another violent crime, it would definitely cause backlash against the diversion program. There is definitely a risk releasing individuals that have committed crimes back into the community, even more so with a violent offender.  I believe that violent offenders that are also suffering from mental illnesses should be remanded to the care of state hospitals. The mental illness needs to be addressed as it could be the cause of, or related to, the violence committed by the individual. This is the best place to manage the mental illness closely and can still keep the offender away from the public until deemed safe to return. "
276,"I do not believe they are the same issues because of the nature of our criminal justice system being grounded in precedent, which is ruled by previously determined best practices, and is not flexible and easy to adjust as needed. The criminal justice system is often seen as rigid and unchanging, and it takes massive effort to get something new implemented. For Mental Health Agencies, the ability to change and adjust to match current research practices would be much easier. It just requires changing the procedures, or trying out new procedures and measuring the outcome of their clients. Because it just involves the staff and clients, small adjustments are easy to make and can be applied on an individual level. Whereas the criminal justice system must have one-size-fits-all procedures because of the numerous amounts of people it processes. It is difficult to implement procedures that are designed to be highly-individualized as there is often not the correct personnel for this or an efficient way to implement this. "
277,"It would be extremely helpful because I feel that drug courts and mental health courts could probably merge many of their cases. It could help to reduce the number of incarcerated on minor drug charges if there was a way to screen those arrested for drugs for a mental illness before adjudication. That way, the mental health court could divert to a treatment program that specializes in co-occurring disorders and have better results in reducing recidivism. Also, reducing the number of individuals that return before the judge due to unsuccessful results in another treatment program."

This young man shouldn't have been in prison, instead he should have been in a mental health facility under the care of a doctor. Although he may have died of dehydration for refusing water, his death resulted from a chain of events. The fact that he was in prison, instead of in a hospital and under the care of a physician, was what precipitated his death. "

This young man shouldn't have been in prison, instead he should have been in a mental health facility under the care of a doctor. Although he may have died of dehydration for refusing water, his death resulted from a chain of events. Putting Timothy in prison was the first mistake officials made; he should have immediately been referred to a mental health treatment facility, based on his previous medical history/psychiatric tests. If there was no option but to confine Timothy to prison, he should have been under the care of a doctor there (the doctor on leave should have been replaced) and he shouldn't have been shackled to the bed for hours on end. Brutality and cruel punishment like these only exacerbate any existing mental health issues -even a person with no mental health problems would decline in these inhumane circumstanced.   The fact that he was in prison, instead of in a hospital and under the care of a physician, was what precipitated his death. "
280,"According to Slate et al. (2013), throughout civilization, mental health conditions have been attributed by varying causes and so treatment has varied. In pre-civilization and in the middle ages,  mental illness was related to having evil spirits or possession, and they would remove parts of the person's skull (similar to an early lobotomy). In the Ancient civilizations they thought mental illness was caused by impurities in the body, so it had to be cleansed. Although the Romans thought people with mental illness should be treated humanely, in the middle ages, they were treated as outcasts, tortured, and killed. With The Renaissance came more humane treatment and the first mental health hospital, but that soon changed in the pre-civil war era, where people with mental health conditions were seen as immoral. Dorothea Dix tried to establish more humane treatment versus punishment for those afflicted. In the U.S., how people with mental health conditions are viewed and the treatment they receive varies greatly by who is the political power at the time. In conclusion, treatment and care for people with mental health issues is largely determined by people's perception of mental illness, which in turn determines how much politicians back the issue, and how much funding and resources they allocate to the hospitals and communities.  References Slate, R. N., Buffington-Vollum, J. K., & Johnson, W. W. (2013).  The criminalization of mental illness: Crisis and opportunity for the justice system. Carolina Academic Press."
281,"Based on the current statistics, that only 3 to 5% of mentally ill people are violent, it would seem that having a registry of mentally ill people has more costs than benefits. This list would have many non-violent people with a mental illness and this is both humiliating and a violation of their privacy. It also further stigmatizes people with mental illness, and people's perceptions are directly related to how politicians respond and how the governments treat those with mental illness. Usually a person's mental health state (unless they're dangerous) is for the knowledge of the family, close friends, and the psychiatrist; however, having this list would broadcast that sensitive information. On the other hand, having a list of people with mental illness would help to curb gun violence and suicide if those people had a history of violence. Therefore, maybe they should amend the national registry to include only those with mental illness and a history of violence. However,  in many of the school shootings the shooters had no prior history of violence, so this wouldn't be a solution to the gun-violence problem. The problem of gun violence is deeper and more complex than just looking for a scapegoat (in this case people with mental illness); it's a combination of the glamorization, by the media and Hollywood, of violence, bullying in schools, and how people are connecting less with one another, making them less empathetic, more self-serving, and unhappy."
282,"What's most important is ""fixing"" how people view those with mental illness. How do we do it? By educating them.  Crystal Dieleman mentioned a very compelling statement in the Ted Talk, and that is excluding people with mental illness from our communities -denying them the opportunity for work, or of living in a certain place, of normal citizenship- is what gives rise to violence. If people don't have their basic necessities of love, safety, social connections, economic comfort, then anger builds and violence ensues. As Crystal Dieleman  says, mental illness is not a predictor of violence, but excluding people with mental illness is. If more people knew this, and were educated on the difference between a mental illness and emotional disregulation or anger problems (Slate et al, 2013) then maybe we could help curb our violent society."
283,"According to Slate et al. (2013), the perception of people with mental illness has been a rollercoaster ride. Mental illness has been attributed to everything from evil spirits, imbalances of bodily fluids and demonology to biological theories, and the treatment has vacillated from a more humane and empathetic approach to severely inhumane ones. Although throughout time, there have been shifts in perception and treatment, what hasn't changed is the negative stigma attached to people with mental health issues and the corresponding belief that they can't be full-fledged participants of society. All of the pre-civil war theories on mental illness, whether it was demons on biological determinism, looked at mental illness as something that the person was born with, and was ""unchangeable"" (Slate et al., 2013). In the 1900s, as advances were made in medicine, lobotomies were popularized, and this form of treatment also gave way to the line of thinking that people with mental illness weren't responsible or in control of their actions and needed to be controlled. If society views a group of individuals as unable to control their behavior, and instead needing external (by force) control, they will never be viewed as normal citizens. Slate et al. (2013) correctly affirms that Americans have always believed that people with mental illness can't make decisions or care for themselves, and this view is what lead to involuntary commitments in mental health care facilities. This thinking was in line with  parens patriae, where the governments knows what's best and acts for their citizens. When that began, people who were being committed had virtually no rights or legal recourse and could be committed without even a trial. However, things have improved a little as far as the legal arena. The problem with NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) is still prevalent today. Although there are more protections and rights for people with mental illness, there is not enough support or funding for adequate treatment, and the criminal justice system is where most people with mental illness are. Instead of getting the treatment they need, they're being victimized, condemned to homelessness, recirculated into the prisons and jails, and losing their lives and their chances of improving. It's a vicious cycle of perceiving PWMI as incapable, treating them as such without consideration of their illness, and this in turn translates into inequality and anger. <"

285,"Hi Briana, I like how you detailed the treatment of PWMI throughout the years. The way people with mental illness have been treated throughout history has varied, however, the common denominator is that PWMI have been excluded from society. Due to the  parens  patriae doctrine, the government has the need to protect those who can't protect themselves. Therefore, society has long believed that PWMI are incapable of being independent, productive members of society; this is evidenced by the involuntary commitment of PWMI over the years (Slate et al., 2013). With deinstitutionalization, people with mental illness had no recourse and many were taken out of hospitals and into the streets; therefore, those PWMI with visible symptoms such as the positive ones that come with schizophrenia (hallucinations and disorganized movement or speech) were out in the streets for all people to see (APA, 2013). This contributed and worsened the stigma of PWMI and confirmed the belief that they couldn't be full-fledged members of our society. What's missing is education about PWMI and of the various types of mental illness. Like you said, the majority of PWMI aren't violent; the media plays a big role in perpetuating that myth of violence. It's the responsibility of mental health educators and the media to help correct this erroneous line of thinking. References American Psychiatric Association. (2013).

286,"Hi Alyse, I really enjoyed reading your post! You made an excellent point about the Greek and Roman civilization and how they took into account the needs of PWMI and regarded mental illness as a disease just like any other physical one. It's incredible to think how far advanced that civilization was in many fronts. When the question about the registry for PWMI was posed, what immediately came to mind was the registry for sexual offenders; should people with mental illness be considered offenders as in the case of sexual predators? The answer of course is no! However, unless we change the perception of PWMI as violent or dangerous in our communities, this is how they will be viewed."
287,"One of the ways in which a president can be effective in curbing stigma is by the use of proper language. Notice that President Obama used the term ""people with mental health illnesses"" instead of using terms like ""schizophrenics"" or ""the mentally ill"". This proper use of language helps to lessen connotations of the  ""us"" and ""them"" mentality. Also, the Obama talks about mental illness as being something treatable, like a physical disease. Much of the stigma surrounding mental illness is that the disease IS the person, however, people don't feel that way when it comes to physical illness. Therefore, saying that mental illness is treatable or amenable to treatment helps give people a different perspective: the disease is not the person, it's an aspect of that person and it can be treated. Lastly, Obama touched on the fact that mental illness affects many people and there's no reason to feel shame. This is important because when thinking of mental illness, many people think about schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, which have external symptoms that are visible, however, mental illness comes in all types of different forms and there's many people suffering silently."
288,"Movement towards reducing mental health benefits is saying that mental health is not important. Policymaker's are blatantly saying that mental health is not nearly as important as physical health and that people with mental health issues are not as important or valuable than those without them, or even compared to those with physical health issues. "
289,"As far as active military, I agree with the soldier -taking medications while active is hazardous and risky because of the medication's possible side effects. However, I do believe veterans with mental health issues should take medication for their symptoms, if these medications help alleviate their symptoms and help them lead more productive and happy lives. Just like the soldier in the video said, talk therapy and group counseling is a great form of treatment for those with mental illness. It helps them see that their not alone; having a support group is important because it helps with feelings of isolation and depression. Also, meeting people who have shared similar experiences helps bridge the gap in the social connections they've possible lost after going to war."

292,"This is a tough question and I think it really depends on the mental illness in question and whether or not it's affecting the person and those around him in a negative way. If a person has an anxiety disorder, mild depression, or narcissistic personality disorder and they can function well and don't think they need treatment, I don't think society needs to step in. However, if a person has schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and their symptoms, internal or external, are impeding their functioning and endangering others (for example, if they're driving and having hallucinations or delusions), then I think some kind of treatment should be mandated. If a person has trouble functioning because of their mental illness and is in regular contact with other people, treatment would help ensure their safety and that of those around them. Treatment doesn't always have to comprise of medication, but I believe some kind of treatment is necessary."
293,"In the article by Rüsch et al., 2005, studies of the perception of the public in regard to PWMI concluded 3 things: people with mental illness are feared and in effect should be excluded from the general population, they're irresponsible and can't be trusted with major life decisions, and they resemble children in that they can't take care of themselves. Also, people with certain mental illnesses like substance abuse are seen as responsible for creating their own illness. These perceptions not only affect those who don't live in close proximity to a PWMI, they also affect the family members and loved ones of PWMI. It is these views and their accompanying labels -saying ""schizophrenic"" instead of ""person with schizophrenia"" that taint many people's perceptions of the reality of mental illnesses. Stereotypes will always exist, however, it's important that people be aware that they're not always valid and most importantly, if they do exist, that they don't lead to prejudice. According to Rüsch et al., 2005, stereotypes and prejudice aren't the only ingredients needed in order for stigma to prevail, what's needed is power and authority. This is why it's imperative that schools educate our children on the reality of mental illness in order to break the cycle of stigma,  so children will grow up knowing that a mental illness is a disease like any other, and that there's no shame in seeking help. Not only is it important for schools to educate our children, it's important that health care professionals make mental health check-ups as important as physical check-ups. Children have to get wellness checks every year, as well as adults need physicals, what about mental health wellbeing? The medical community doesn't prioritize mental check-ups, instead, treatment is voluntary and usually sought out by adults and by the parents of children, but it's not considered a routine part of people's wellbeing, and it should be.

294,"Hi Elise, I enjoyed reading your post and had a similar viewpoint. Schools should definitely educate students on the realities of mental health and help them understand that having a mental illness is just like having a physical illness. There should be no fear or shame is seeking help if you have mental health issues, and educators have the power and authority to reduce the stigma associated with it. Also, I argued that this power and authority also rests in the hands of the medical community -not just psychiatrists or psychologists, who usually treat people that seek help voluntarily- but non-mental health physicians. Physical check-ups and wellbeing are such an important part of both adults and children's lives, but mental health doesn't factor into the equation. Checking people's mental wellbeing routinely will not only benefit their own health but the wellbeing of others around them."
295,"Hi Wendy, You made great points and I like the idea of highlighting notable individuals and their success despite having a mental illness. People with all kinds of physical illnesses can be successful and productive and the general public should know that this is true of people with mental illness as well. The media plays such a huge role in people's perceptions of mental illness and especially with suggestible youth. Even though some people in the media may be knowledgable about mental illness and aware of the negative stigma they're propagating, it's all about politics and money and sensationalism. This is why it's a long road towards changing the falsities that are shown in that medium.  However, although schools and the health care community have the authority and power to educate young people and combat the stigma of mental illness, TV and movies are a great way for youth to also learn the realities of mental illness.  A Beautiful Mind is a great example that you mentioned and I also thought of  Mr. Jones with Richard Gere. Hopefully, Hollywood will help teach people about mental illness and help de-stigmatize it."
296,"Hi Clara, Thanks for your thoughts! I agree with all of your points. I have a 3 and 4-year-old and I think that there's developmentally appropriate ""checks"" that the doctors or mental health professionals can do. However, mental health is more ""monitored"" in young kids like ours, both by parents and teachers, and most people are aware of what red flags to look for or when something isn't right. Also, kids that age are never without adult supervision (or at least they shouldn't be). I was thinking more for older kids, teens, and adults. Our society stigmatizes the mentally ill so much that even mental health checks seem scary and daunting, as if people were going to be submitted to shame just by sharing this with their doctor. However, I see it as preventative and as a way of referring people to get the help they need. I do think that educating our youth is a major way to break the cycle, although educating adults is also important. What a kid learns in school will sometimes be challenged by the adults in his home, and if they believe in the negative stereotypes and stigmatize the mentally ill, the child will have a hard time having different thoughts. Your post gave me a lot to think about! Thanks :)."
297,"As the doctor in the video said, ""As you make a test more sensitive or more able to pick up disease if it’s there, you make it less specific or less able to prove that a positive result is really real"". Translating this into the world of mental health, as you make the definitions of mental health more specific, they will be less sensitive. Let's take for example the definition of grave disability and how they've expanded it, or made it more specific. In Assembly Bill 1971, they've expanded the term ""grave disability"" to include those who can't take care of their basic personal health necessities such as cleanliness. If this bill passes, a number of people who are homeless or otherwise who can't care for their personal needs can be committed involuntarily. So by making the definition of grave disability more specific, we're being less sensitive and involuntarily committing people who should not be committed."
298,"This one is tough to answer for me. If the alternative to committing violent sexual predators is longer prison sentences, I agree with the professor in the video: committing them and giving them treatment is more humane than a longer prison sentence. A longer prison sentence would not incorporate treatment, on the contrary, it might worsen the mental health of the offender. However, the attorney in the video mentioned that most of these svp's were not doing anything in regards to treatment in the facility, which is not ideal. A better situation would be if the treatment facility operated in more of a therapeutic capacity, offering counseling and maybe short periods in the community in efforts to reintegrate the offender. Since treatment does improve the chances of recidivism, it should be a must for anyone convicted of a sexually violent crime. I do think commitment with treatment should be in effect but only for those convicted of violent and repeat sexual crimes."
299,"Inpatient treatment is more of a reach of state authority because the individual has absolutely no freedom or liberty to get out and has no idea how long s/he will be there. In outpatient commitment, the person has to comply with a certain treatment, whether it be medication adherence, individual/group therapy, or a combination of both before s/he can be completely ""free"". Patients have to adhere to the treatment protocol in outpatient commitment so as to avoid inpatient commitment, which I think is relatively fair. If medication does indeed help certain people with mental illness, outpatient commitment has been proven to help with medication compliance and this is a positive. If more people who are on the streets are getting treatment with medication, and sticking to it, this means less people with untreated mental illness on the streets."
300,"According to the text of Slate et al. (2013) involuntary commitment serves the dual purpose of providing treatment to those PWMI that so desperately need it, on one hand, and of keeping society safe, on the other. There are many people that can't afford treatment, have no employer-provided health insurance, or are unaware that they have a mental illness. If anyone is diagnosed with a mental illness and falls into the above categories, coupled with the fact that they have done something that is considered dangerous to themselves or others, treatment is necessary and sometimes needs to be compulsory. Therefore, outpatient civil commitment is necessary and humane in these cases, because otherwise, those people without proper mental health resources will be victimized, criminalized, or will otherwise lose any chance of being an integrated member of society. On the other hand, involuntary inpatient commitment infringes on the life and liberty of these same people because they have no say in the matter, and most importantly, they have no idea how long it'll last. This one aspect, not knowing how long they'll be committed, is the greatest infringement to liberty; this is a liberty that all convicted criminals enjoy. With this deprivation of liberty, you have to wonder, is this for the good of the committed or are we outcasting these members from society? As Slate et al. (2013) also outline in the book, all you need is ""clear and convincing"" evidence and not the ""guilty beyond a reasonable doubt"" standard that criminals have, and this further points to the fact that we believe PWMI should be locked up and the key should be thrown away. We give criminals a second chance when we release them, but the indefinite timeline of inpatient involuntary commitment says the opposite of PWMI. If outpatient commitment is a way to increase medication compliance and readmission into the hospital as some studies have found, I believe it's the most humane way possible to treat PWMI who are a danger to themselves or others, and who don't have anosognosia (Swartz et al., 2004). Outpatient commitment has also been shown to reduce homelessness and this is a positive step in the right direction. The problem is when states have their own way of defining what's considered ""grave disability""; the expansion of the term (as assembly bill 1971 proposes) to include those who have a ""deteriorating physical condition"" who if not committed could worsen or die. This makes it eas"
301,"Hi Elise, Involuntary commitment does indeed violate individuals due process rights under the 14th amendment. In  Foucha v. Louisiana the court held that individuals have to be released from commitment once they regain their ""sanity"". Foucha was found not guilty by insanity; apparently he was under the influence of drugs and burglarized a home and shot at a police officer. Once he recovered from his drug-induced craze, he was deemed not mentally ill anymore, but was still considered dangerous due to his ongoing fights with the hospital staff. Foucha appealed, but the court of appeals ruled that they weren't violating his 14th Amendment rights because he was dangerous, however, in the absence of mental illness, they couldn't commit him anymore. Therefore, dangerousness and mental illness needed to be present in order to be involuntarily committed. Although I believe involuntary commitment is a violation of the 14th amendment, in some cases it's necessary to protect the person and the public. References Papadakis, E. M. (1993). Fourteenth Amendment: the continued confinement of insanity acquittees. The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology (1973-), 83(4), 944-977. Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U.S. 71, 112 S. Ct. 1780, 118 L. Ed. 2d 437 (1992)."
302,"Hi Christie, In reading the article by Teh et al. (2014), I thought about how self-stigma of PWMI contributes to public stigma. If PWMI internalize the public's stigmas about themselves, they're more reluctant to seek help for their mental health issues. It's a cycle: the public stigmatizes PWMI , so PWMI self-stigmatize; PWMI self-stigmatize, so the public stigmatizes them. If PWMI get the help they need, they will be given the tools to improve how they think about their mental illness and this in turn might help whomever they come across in terms of their views of PWMI. The problem is, because of self-stigma, PWMI are unwilling to get help (those without anosognosia). I believe there's a need not just to educate the public without mental illness, but to encourage those people with mental illness to be more vocal about their illness and the realities and struggles they face. When people understand others, they're more apt to be empathetic and more willing to integrate them into society. Silence on the part of PWMI only exacerbates an already existing prejudice that could be curbed with more communication. If more people with mental illness are willing to speak out about their disease, it will motivate others to come forward and end stigma. Reference Teh, J. L., King, D., Watson, B., & Liu, S. (2014). Self-stigma, perceived stigma, and help-seeking communication in people with mental illness.  PORTAL Journal of Multidisciplinary International Studies,  11(1)."
303,"Hi Dr. Turner, Does a response to Christie count as a response, or does it have to be 2 students? Thanks, Vivi"
304,"I think either prosecution and pretrial services or adjudication would be the most difficult for PWMI to navigate, mainly because of the complex legalese used when dealing with attorneys and judges. Although most of the terms would be described and explained, even I find all of these steps confusing and intimidating and I can only imagine how scary and overwhelming it must be for PWMI. I think it also largely depends on what mental illness we're referring to; all PWMI are not the same, each mental illness has different characteristics that would make the criminal case processing easier or harder to grasp."
305,"If there are many PWMI in local jurisdictions, and felons are being shifted to local jails as well, many PWMI will be exposed to those felons who were shifted. This could mean an increase in victimization for them. Also, instead of PWMI being sent to treatment facilities and hospitals where many belong, they're being housed in jail with no access to treatment, exposure to sometimes violent criminals, and as a consequence may experience deteriorating mental health conditions. Reducing the prison population was essential due to the worsening of health due to overcrowding, however, shifting inmates to local jurisdictions doesn't get to the root of the issue nor does it fix the problem. The drug war has to end, and in increase of mental health resources and centers has to be provided to those who need it, instead of funneling them through the corrections system."
306,"No, it's not fair. Police officers did not go into law enforcement to be mental health professionals. Unfortunately, crimes are sometimes committed by PWMI or PWMI sometimes find themselves in unfavorable situations in which police have to respond. It's not always apparent to police officers who has a mental illness and who doesn't; this is why it's imperative that officers are trained on how to face situations with PWMI and/or go to those types of calls with a mental health professional. It's not fair, but it's how law enforcement should be shaped going forward."
307,"CIT helps reduce stigma because it works on officers' negative  attitudes towards PWMI. One of the training aspects of CIT is the signs and symptoms of mental illness and how to de-escalate problems. This encourages officers to exhibit empathy and understanding towards PWMI and to see them as people who have feelings, emotions, hopes, and fears. By viewing PWMI with empathy, officers are increasing their understanding of mental illness and are better able to view them as people, just like themselves. It reduces the ""us"" and ""them"" mentality."
308,"The Taheri (2016) article had mixed findings on CIT, especially since the effectiveness depended on the location and the function of the CIT officers. Some of the reasons for the discrepancies among the different locations was how different officers or locations defined PWMI; some defined mental illness as having a mental health disease diagnosis and others defined it as a sort of mental crisis; implying that it could be temporary or drug-induced (Taheri, 2016). This led to differences in what calls were considered CIT calls or how they were coded, which eventually determined what kind of intervention the person would get. It's inarguable that CIT helped officers in their abilities to identify PWMI and how to respond appropriately (de-escalation versus violence and aggression). Also, most of the CIT-trained officers made fewer arrests of PWMI than the non-CIT trained; which means that those people who weren't arrested were most likely being referred for mental health care instead of going through the corrections system. Although there wasn't enough evidence to link CIT to police officer's use of force or post-arrest procedures, there was no doubt that the trained CIT officers were more apt to take PWMI to community mental health services in lieu of arrest, which is an important reason why I would continue and expand the CIT model for PWMI. However, I don't think there should be training for ""select officers"" depending on how they're perceived in the force as natural de-escalators or more prone to resort to violence, I think it should be mandatory training, state-wide, for anyone who wants to become a police officer. Mental health training should be as pervasive and lengthy as the weapons and defense tactics that officers learn and shouldn't be limited to a few. Being arrested is the gateway to the criminal justice system and in some cases, the gateway to treatment for PWMI. However, even if those PWMI who are arrested will eventually be released and receive the treatment they  need, the act of being arrested and the consequences it brings, is unnecessary and can be avoided. I see the avoidance of arrest of PWMI coupled with de-stigmatization the main uses for CIT and the beginning to the de-criminalization of the mentally ill. Police officers usually arrest PWMI because they either don’t know how to deal with mental illness, and/or there’s too much of a wait time to get help from mental health professionals (Franz & Borum, 2011). CIT"
309,"Hi Caroline, That's exactly what I was referring to, the differences in defining mental illness can lead to discrepancies in how CIT calls are addressed (Taheri, 2016). If I were conducting a CIT program I would first standardize the definition of mental illness and that would be based on the Surgeon General's definition outlined in the Goldman & Grob (2006) article: a diagnosable disorder which includes changes in behavior, mood, or thinking. Based on this definition, a mental illness can be temporary and drug-induced or chronic and unrelated to drug use. However, this is tricky because if a person is under the influence and is experiencing hallucinations, these will end once the person gets sober, and this isn't the case with someone experiencing active symptoms of schizophrenia, for example. So in a CIT call, would these cases have to be treated differently? Should the person who's under the influence have to go to a mental health treatment facility or rehab? Most states require that a person commit a crime in order to be involuntary committed into rehab, so a person experiencing a drug or alcohol-induced mental illness would have to commit a crime and go through the arrest process before being sent to rehab against their will (Farabee, 1998). On the other hand, if no crime was committed and they were treated like another CIT call and directed towards a mental health center, they would be back out on the streets again in no time. I think the CIT model is going in the right direction; the main thing I would do is to standardize the definition with the help of mental health professionals and expand CIT training and education to all officers involved, not just some.

310,"Hi Steve, Your answer was right on point; it's not a matter of getting rid of CIT, it's a matter of refining it. Also, although the Taheri (2016) didn't find that the reduction of arrests was statistically significant, there were less arrests and less is better than no reduction. In addition, other studies show the opposite in regards to arrest rates. The article by Compton et al., (2014) showed that CIT did indeed make arrests more unlikely and that the tactic most used by CIT officers was negotiation or verbal agreements, which would preclude arrests.  Most importantly, we both mentioned that CIT reduces stigma, and I'd say this is essential as a first step to decriminalize people with mental illness. Officers are the first ones who usually have contact with PWMI and although they didn't sign up for that in the job description, it's an inevitable part of the job. References Taheri, S. A. (2016).

311,"It must be hopeless, degrading, and infuriating. If a PWMI is being incarcerated over and over again for petty crimes, sometimes in order to meet their basic needs (food and shelter), that's the equivalent of society saying that they don't care about them and just want them out of the way. It's also saying that they're common criminals, which they're not. They're people who are sick and in desperate need of treatment, like any other physical illness."
312,"1- History of mental illness and current state of mental illness should be an important indicator so that jails can provide medication and therapy (treatment) to those who need it. Assessing inmates as soon as they're booked and throughout their stay in jail should be imperative. 2- Co-occurring disorders such as substance abuse should also be assessed in order to get inmates proper substance abuse counseling and prevent co-occurring mental disorders.  3- Lifestyle that led to incarceration, such as homelessness, unemployment, or lack of medication, etc. should be an indicator that would help once the individual is released and in order to prevent recidivism."
313,"I think inmates are given a fair amount of rights, the problem is when these rights aren't respected. I have a huge problem with the use of force, violence, or rape by other prisoners and mostly, by the guards themselves. This is a gross violation of the 8th amendment and should be given the maximum punishment. As the video said, most sexual violations aren't prosecuted, and that's probably because the inmates are afraid of the repercussions by the guards. Prison shouldn't be a place of further victimization and violence, because that only makes prisoner's mental health and violent acts worse. Also, I don't think that there should be as many limits to the phone calls and visitation rights; it's important for inmate's mental health to have unlimited access to their family members or support groups. The other right that should always be respected and that isn't is right to medical treatment; illness, whether physical or mental, should never be ignored just because a person is in prison."
314,"Given that jail staff are not therapists and/or given the fact that hiring mental health staff may be more expensive than medication, it's the preferred method of treatment. Medication is absolutely necessary for some forms of mental illness, but not all. Medication also makes the prisoner easier to deal with by pacifying them or ""restraining"" them in a way, which is easier than therapy which can be a gradual form of treatment that takes time. Training staff is a process which can be quite expensive as well, so medication is the most common and sometimes only form of treatment used. Another possible explanation is that prisoners can refuse right to treatment or medication, so this might be another way to keep prisoners in jail."
315,"Realignment did indeed decrease the prison population in California per their stated goal, however it increased the jail population way over capacity (Lofstrom et al., 2010). Therefore, the overcrowding and its disastrous consequences like poor physical and mental health that was occurring in the prisons, merely got shifted to the jails. This is adding insult to injury considering that offenders who enter jails are in far worse condition than those who are in prison, due to the fact that many are coming from the bad family or street situations there were in to begin with. Additionally, although realignment aimed to transfer the least violent offenders to jails, these same offenders would be serving longer sentences, which demanded that the jails provide more resources such as additional beds, mental and physical health services, and recreational activities (Lofstrom et al., 2010). This only added stress to the inmates, the staff, and increases in violence between them increased. For people with mental illness, the stress of overcrowding and lack of mental and physical health resources inside and outside of the correctional system is consequential and therefore makes the use of jails for PWMI extremely inappropriate. Serious mental illness usually refers to bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and major depressive disorder. According to Torrey et al. (2010), research suggests that about 15 to 20 percent of inmates have a serious mental illness. The rates of serious mental illness for those entering jail is high due to the lacking community health resources available and can only worsen with the inadequate circumstances of jail. Victimization and trauma are precursors to criminality and there's ample evidence to suggest that offenders are victims of violence and trauma in jail, especially those with mental illness (DeHart et al., 2014). Not only that, but mental illness commonly happens with co-occurring disorders such as substance abuse, which is especially common for PWMI who don’t adhere to their medication and instead prefer to self-medicate due to prescription side-effects. Jail is not known for being a good rehab center, on the contrary, drugs abound and inmates can refuse treatment. What needs to happen is a restructuring of the criminal justice system -PWMI who commit crimes should not be sent to common jails, instead, they need access to more diversion programs and treatment. Jail diversion helps PWMI inside of their own community, pr"
316,"Hi Elise, I agree with you on the inappropriateness of jails for PWMI. You mentioned that there were no viable alternatives currently, however, there are. According to a study conducted by Steadman et al. (2009), currently about one third of U.S. jails have diversion programs for people with mental illness. Steadman et al. (2009) define diversion programs as those that screen inmates for mental illness using mental health professionals (not just jail staff) and then negotiate with the courts, prosecutors, and mental health experts to come up with an alternative to incarceration. These alternatives almost always comprise of community based services that sometimes reduce the charges (if convicted), demand treatment and/or adherence to medication, and link the person to community resources. Most of these jail diversion programs have been successful in terms of reducing recidivism of PWMI and adherence to treatment, especially since it's court mandated (Steadman et al., 2009).  Alternatively, there are also mental health courts that only hear cases regarding PWMI, although the funding for these programs is quite limited and not all jurisdictions have them (Clark, 2004). In the end, it all boils down to funding and politics; the ideas are there, however, it's hard to implement them when there's no power or money to support them. References Clark, J. W. (2004).

317,"Hi Amber, Thanks for your reply! Sorry about the misunderstanding; realignment didn't increase arrests for PWMI, it only increased the jail population due to the shifting of non-violent inmates from prisons to jails. Prop 57 stresses rehabilitation and gives inmates some degree of control over their prison sentence by giving them incentives for good behavior and participation in prison activities. It also moves up parole hearings for those who have served their full prison sentence for their main offense (CDCR, 2019). This makes for a somewhat safer prison environment and allow the inmates to show they'd pose no threat if they were to be in the community again. Prop 47 reclassified certain instances of property and drug crimes as misdemeanors instead of felonies and allowed re-sentencing for those inmates who had been serving time for those crimes, in order to reduce their sentences based on this new proposition (Lofstrom et al., 2016). Like you said, I believe that both of these propositions aim to incorporate  rehabilitation into the criminal justice system (especially Prop 57). By giving inmates shorter prison sentences and allowing them to give back to the community, they're strengthening their ties with society through collaboration.  However, I don't think these propositions do much for PWMI, especially those with severe mental illness,  because I don't believe they should be processed through the prison system. It's unlikely that PWMI who commit crimes will not have to go through the system at all if they commit a crime, but a person with a severe mental illness should be viewed with a different lens than an offender without a severe mental illness. One way to do this is having mental health courts that hear special cases relating to PWMI and use different kinds of ""sanctions"", such as court-mandated treatment and/or service within the community in lieu of prison time, which would only worsen the mental health of a person with severe mental illness (Clark, 2004).

318,"Hi Christie, Some of the operational issues have to do with how the corrections systems handles those PWMI. Slate et al., (2013) outline various instances where a person with mental illness commits a crime and is incompetent to stand trial. When this happens, due to the shortage of community mental health resources, they spend months in jail before they can be transferred to a facility to restore competency. Many PWMI will decompensate in jail due to refusal of medication and the architectural constraints of the prison, such as overcrowding; which will worsen their condition. In these cases, a PWMI may oscillate between competency and incompetency due to ""riding the bus"" -going from the hospital, back to jail, decompensating, and having to go back to the hospital, then to jail again (Slate et al., 2013), Not only that but PWMI are often placed in isolation because they either can't conform the the rules due to their mental illness, or because the guards are ""protecting"" them from others. Isolation has dire effects for a person who has a severe mental illness and can increase depression and the risk of suicide (Slate et al., 2013). Another consequence of realignment was that due to the reclassification of certain drug and petty crimes from felonies to misdemeanors, PWMI (who mostly commit non-violent crimes) were released out into the streets (Lamb & Weinberger, 2014). Without access or means to get medication, treatment, jobs, or affordable housing they stay on the streets until they're recirculated back into the criminal justice system for another petty crime. This creates a never-ending cycle of homelessness to prison pipeline. As far as architectural issues, realignment created a reduction of the prison population but an increase in the jail population, which led to overcrowding. Overcrowding has detrimental consequences for anyone, but especially for a PWMI; the volume of voices as a result of the overcrowding is compounded by the architecture of the prison that's built to make voices carry. Also, a prison's design is supposed to be another source of punishment for the prisoners. Prisons are dark, windowless buildings that lack life and natural light. This affects a person without mental illness but it's tenfold for a person with a severe mental illness such as major depressive disorder (Elton, 2007). References Slate, R. N., Buffington-Vollum, J. K., & Johnson, W. W. (2013).  The criminalization of"
319,"Yes, I think they're fair. Although the risk assessment tools are not 100% accurate, they provide a good baseline for evaluation. Risk assessment can pinpoint who needs treatment, what mental problems are going on with the offender, and what he/she needs in order to correct those behaviors or address those illnesses. Using risk assessment helps to ensure that offenders are getting rehabilitative treatment instead of just punishment and as a consequence, it also helps with ensuring increased public safety. Using risk assessment and helping offenders correct criminal behavior patterns means that, as a society, we believe they're capable of change and not just destined by their genetics and biology."
320,"I think they would be partially receptive due to the fact that there's many other factors, besides behavioral and environmental, that can contribute to PWMI committing crimes. Besides the biology of the actual mental illness, it's lack of treatment in the community, entrance into the criminal justice system and worsening of symptoms, and lack of exit programs to help with life after incarceration that affect PWMI. Besides recidivism, there's the concern of suicide and other ""tip of the iceberg"" symptoms that PWMI may have for lack of treatment or inadequate treatment."
321,"Probation is set up to allow the offender rehabilitation. It matches them to community services; to work in the community  and give back to society. In contrast, jail is pure punishment. Although inmates are allowed to ""work"" in jail and do community activities there, it's inside of the jail and not integrated into the community; it's not the real world. An offender that gets probation is offered a chance to do better, make amends, and reintegrate into society."
322,"I would feel a little more stigmatized than if I was going through the traditional court processing, however, I would prefer it. You either have the stigma of mental illness or the stigma of criminality. Although our society stigmatizes both, mental illness seems more heavily stigmatized due to the fact that people think the symptoms are always present. People are scared of mental illness and therefore scared of people with mental illness, mostly due to a lack of understanding. People are also scared of criminals, but it highly depends on the type of crime. Traditional court processing looks to punish individuals, while mental health courts seek to treat and reintegrate into the community through treatment adherence."
323,"  According to Skeem et al., (2015) the risk-need-responsivity model is based on a policy to reduce recidivism, augment safety, and decrease corrections costs instead of only focusing on the treatment of PWMI by reducing symptoms. This model is based on the fact that there’s little to no evidence available that treating PWMI with therapy and/or medication reduces recidivism, which makes sense considering that having a mental illness is not related to crime commission, especially violent crimes. Also, experts in the field are trying to reduce the risk of criminality instead of merely assessing people for risk of committing crimes. However, any Chief Probation Officer who is supervising a person with mental illness has to be careful to not just control and diminish risk (as the RNR model states) but to also manage symptoms and functionality of a PWMI. By coupling mental health treatment (reduction of symptoms) with behavioral techniques aimed to curb criminal acts (like cognitive behavioral therapy -CBT), PWMI who commit crimes will get treatment for their mental illness and corrections will achieve their public safety goals by modifying criminal behavior and helping offenders make changes to their environment. RNR can give treatment professionals and specialty probation officers cues on who they need to treat, however, concluding that only those deemed at higher risk of reoffending will benefit from the model is dangerous because it could leave out other low-risk offenders who will indeed reoffend -like some PWMI who commit petty crimes (Skeem et al., 2015). Also, correctional risk assessment tools measure personality traits that are applicable to the general corrections population who commits crimes (such as criminal history, anger issues, impulsivity, etc.), and although PWMI share those traits, the tools and are not necessarily catered to PWMI; when PWMI were assessed with the risk assessment tool LS/CMI, scores weren’t too different in comparison with people without mental illness (Skeem et al., 2015). Does this mean there’s no difference between an offender with mental illness and one without? No, it means that those symptoms specific to different mental illnesses were not taken into account. If RNR is meant to curb criminal behavior through cognitive behavioral intervention instead of just treating mental illness, it might not be as effective to a PWMI than for an offender without mental illness. In other words, those sympto"
324,"Hi Briana, You made a great suggestion when you said that you'd propose the Chief Probation Officer look at the types of conditions for probation of PWMI. Community services, whether the person has a mental illness or not, are more effective at producing positive changes when they're done in the community and not behind bars (Skeem, 2017). This makes perfect sense when you consider that inmates are in a very stressful environment behind bars, and having a mental illness makes it even more precarious. Although speciality probation was not shown to reduce violence, it did decrease recidivism in general, which means less PWMI are re-entering jails and prisons. Some of the factors responsible for the reduced recidivism in the study by Manchak et al., (2014) was that probation officers had less cases and so they were able to spend more quality time with the offender and be more involved in his/her treatment. This goes to show that treatment with reintegration into the community and cognitive behavioral therapy have a higher success rate than just correctional treatment. Interestingly, the probationers received treatment for their mental illness and any co-occurring disorders, but they didn't receive substance abuse treatment more frequently than traditional probationers. This is alarming and should be remedied because more than 75% of PWMI have substance abuse issues and substance abuse is considered one of the main criminogenic factors (Skeem et al., 2015).

325,"Hi Christie, Yes, I absolutely think the treatment of PWMI should encompass not just features of the RNR model that would reduce recidivism, but evidence based practices such as assertive community treatment (ACT) which would reduce symptoms and increase functionality. Offenders with mental illness are a special group because they share commonalities with PWMI who don't commit crimes in terms of the treatment they need, but they also share common ground with offenders that don't have mental illness, in terms of why they commit crimes (Rotter & Carr, 2013). For example, a PWMI with schizophrenia will need treatment with medication and counseling in combination with CBT to restructure thought patterns and behaviors to effectively reduce his chances of recidivism, improve his chances of living a productive life, and reintegrate into the community. While experts believe that ACT doesn't reduce recidivism, it helps reduce symptoms and improve functionality of a PWMI (Rotter & Carr, 2013). ACT is an evidenced based practice that uses mobile units to actively search for PWMI who might be homeless and provide them with financial, job, mental health, and housing resources that they may not otherwise find or be aware of (Lamberti et al., 2004). With this, ACT greatly diminishes risk of hospitalization of PWMI or their entry or recirculation into the criminal justice system. It also helps those PWMI struggling with co-occurring disorders such as addiction, which is not targeted in specialty probation, and is a main criminogenic factor responsible for the street to prison pipeline.

326,"The high stress of a prison environment can worsen the symptoms of a PWMI. Prisons are meant to be punishing and degrading, so everything correctional officers do to correct the behavior of a PWMI will be negative. PWMI have more difficulty following prison rules due to the symptoms of their illness and will often be placed in solitary as protective measure for themselves and others. However, the putting a PWMI in solitary increases his risk of suicide. Also, taking medications (or even going to therapy) puts PWMI at risk for victimization, slows their reflexes, and has side effects. Not taking medications can worsen symptoms."
327,"Only if there's actual rehabilitation going on instead of punishment, which based on readings/videos is seldom. PWMI need to be treated: they need assessment, medication, help with medication adherence, counseling, and tools to be able to survive in the world. This means help with getting employment or ensuring a stable income, housing, help getting and maintaining meaningful relationships. If PWMI are locked up with other offenders without mental illness and are treated as if they didn't need treatment, or worse, further victimized by other inmates and staff, they'll decompensate in prison or commit more crimes because they don't have proper survival skills and treatment."
328,"It's a band-aid solution that ""fixes"" the problem of prison security temporarily, however, it worsens both the mental illness if the inmate in question and the security of society in the long run. An inmate locked in solitary will become more depressed, angry, and antisocial; they'll know less how to deal with people positively and will regards others with suspicion and unease. In my opinion there are no real advantages, only extreme disadvantages. Instead of rehabilitating a person, they're intensifying and worsening any antisocial proclivities or mental illness."
329,"I have no problem with that if PWMI are actually being treated, however, ""treating"" PWMI in prisons does not constitute proper treatment and I do have a problem with my tax dollars going there. Actually treating people with mental illness, providing them with adequate medication, help with adherence to it, counseling and therapy services, and relational and labor tools to help them be productive, non-harming members of society is something that would benefit not only the PWMI, but everyone. We're all affected and touched by other people's mental health problems and it's in our best interest to help treat them."
330,"According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the majority of people with mental illness in prison, 62.6%,  are under the age of 24, which major depression being the main illness; the majority of those with mental illness also have substance abuse issues (James & Glaze, 2016). The fact that the majority of PWMI are under age 25 and have co-occurring substance abuse disorders is problematic because the pre-frontal cortex doesn’t finish developing until the late 20’s; this is what regulates impulse control and is a major factor in adolescents committing crimes and abusing substances (Monahan et al., 2009). The majority of people who are currently in prison entered prison when they were young adults, and many had undiagnosed or untreated mental health disorders; some will even develop a mental illness while in prison, due to the stressful conditions. In an ideal world, PWMI who commit crimes would be held accountable for their actions, but in a rehabilitative setting, so that once they’re release, society could actually be safer and the individuals could get the treatment they need. The first step to maintaining safety is the adequate intake of mental illness upon arrival and during their stay. According to Adams and Ferrandino (2008), although 70% of prisons check inmates for mental illness once they enter prison, a minority of them used the actuarial risk tool to determine risk, which is considered the more reliable tool. If most prisons aren’t using the most reliable tool to predict risk, many PWMI are falling through the cracks and the possibility of treatment goes out the window. The other key for prisons in maintaining inmates and staff safe is to provide more humane treatment to  all prisoners, with special consideration to PWMI; by this I mean assigning mental health professionals to help them while in prison. While not all prisoners entering the system will have mental health problems, some will develop them. The Johnsen et al. (2011) and the Adams and Ferrandino (2008) article both talk about the need to balance prison safety with inmate quality of life. In U.S. prisons, the main ideology that dominates guards’ thinking is how the aim of punishment is to reduce recidivism. However, if inmates, especially PWMI, aren’t treated as human beings and are deemed incorrigible or incapable of rehabilitation, they will go out into society and act accordingly. One of the best prison systems in the world is the Norwegian"
331,"Hi Stephanie, You made some good points. Although I failed to mention this in my post, I agree with your idea that inmates with mental illness should be kept separately from those of the general population. Especially since this may affect their compliance with medication and/or therapy. According to Skeem et al., (2015), many inmates with mental illness will not take their medication for fear of victimization (other inmates will bully them), and because it can slow their reflexes, which won't help them if they need to defend themselves. So separating PWMI from the other inmates will solve this problem. However, inmates with other illnesses have the same issue, such as those with HIV; many don't adhere to their medication for fear of stigma (Rintamaki et al., 2006). I wonder how many prisoners are affected by this and if they should also be kept separately in order to maintain their health and the safety of others in prison and upon their release. You also mentioned the increase in the use of correct medication to lower costs. In addition to this, the staff administering the medication must be qualified and know what they're doing. Many times, the guards are the ones administering the medication and they do so as a way to control or subdue the inmates. Medications and the fluctuations in dosage administration has to be better regulated by mental health professionals who know what they're doing. Because of the shortage of doctors or limited access to them, there's an initiative to allow psychologists to prescribe medication as they have more interactions with and are more available to the inmates (Adams & Ferrandino, 2008).

332,"Hi Karen, I like your idea of educating inmates without mental illness on PWMI;  it speaks to rehabilitation and teaching inmates (and people in general) about empathy. By making prisons more of a rehabilitative setting that a purely punitive one, we're giving inmates the tools to reintegrate into society, instead of further isolating them with the pathological, antisocial interactions seen in prisons today. By focusing on rehabilitation, and increasing education for inmates without mental illness and resources/treatment for PWMI, we're reducing recidivism  (Adams & Ferrandino, 2008). Many inmates with or without mental illness have been abused or mistreated in their lives. The cycle of violence is perpetuated if they're abused in prison by fellow inmates and staff. PWMI spend more time locked away because they have a harder time following prison rules; they start normalizing the pathological treatments of the guards and inmates towards them. Unfortunately, once they’re released, they carry that out into the real world and into their homes; they view others with suspicion and paranoia, some have symptoms of PTSD and exacerbated symptoms relating to their mental illness; this increases their chances of recidivism (Comfort, 2007). A study by Marlow et al. (2012) demonstrated that teaching inmates non-violent communication or skills in understanding other's situations and emotions led to an improvement in their personal lives and relationships with others. Although it might not be a very useful skill on the streets, it helps their interpersonal relationship and efforts to reintegrate into society. References Adams, K., & Ferrandino, J. (2008).

333,"If my tax dollars were going towards improving the chances of rehabilitation for people with severe mental illness, that would otherwise be homeless or committing crimes, I would be very pleased. Although costly, improvement of the mental health of those who need it most is an investment in everyone's safety and security."
334,"Hi Christie, Although all inmates should have more humane treatment in prisons, more mental health resources available in the community and in prison, and good post-release programs to help transition into the community, PWMI have special needs, and as such they should have resources that respond to their needs. Things like adequate mental health intake across the board, medication, therapy, case management, and release programs to help them  reintegrate into society are crucial to improving their mental health and avoiding reincarceration. Since PWMI have a higher risk of committing crimes, there should be community programs in place that prevent incarceration or homelessness from escalating into incarceration in the first place. Additionally, since time in prison does nothing to help mental illness and instead only worsens the individual's symptoms and outcomes, a PWMI should be either referred to community treatment and diversion programs in lieu of prison, or there should be special units in prisons, with qualified mental health professionals who care about treatment first, dedicated to PWMI (Mulvey & Schubert, 2017).  References Mulvey, E. P., & Schubert, C. A. (2017). Mentally ill individuals in jails and prisons.  Crime and justice,  46(1), 231-277."
335,"No, a person deemed NGRI will be committed for life in an institution, instead of going to prison. So in essence, they are trading prison for a mental institution, the difference is, they can never get out of the mental institution. Although a NGRI ""conviction"" says the person committed the offense, they're not responsible for doing it (although they're guilty) because they didn't know it was wrong. However, this label of insanity will go on their record for life. A person with this record can't have a normal life, usually has no chance of release, and are in a prison of their own."
336,"I find it completely amazing and hopeful. If you've never suffered from depression it's hard to understand that it's a disease that doesn't allow you to feel certain emotions, like happiness. People that don't understand tend to think that people with MDD aren't trying to be happy, but it's a chemical problem in the brain. Deep brain stimulation is a promising and revolutionary medical procedure that could change the lives of many, help those who are struggling with mental illness and those are homeless or touched by the criminal justice system."
337,"They need adequate and qualified staff, and they need to increase their staff to patient ratios. The fact that they have to pull untrained staff to help out with mental patients, even if they have some kind of mental health treatment, is part of the reason that there is so much violence.  They should have trained mental health professionals that know how to de-escalate situations before they become violent, and with the patients that are more prone to aggressiveness, mental health professionals should always be in two's."
338,"State hospitals should have the purpose of treating forensic patients or those who are at-risk for becoming involved in the criminal justice system.  According to Sisti et al., (2015) PWMI who are in prison can't receive adequate mental health treatment because the physicians who work there have to balance institutional security and patient wellbeing. A person with a mental illness needs the psychiatrist to maintain patient confidentiality -which is not respected in prison- and needs compassionate care -which is definitely not upheld with practices like segregation or lack of treatment-. This is where the state mental hospitals come in; not only do they provide forensic community-based services like helping those who are incompetent to stand trial, or diversion programs, but they also provide support to PWMI who were incarcerated once they're released (2018, Department of State Hospitals Annual Report). When PWMI go to prison, their health benefits are suspended, and once released they have to re-enroll. Managing the healthcare system is complicated enough and PWMI have little guidance on how to do it. If PWMi are release from prison and still have no access to treatment, they will most likely go back to prison or end up on the streets. State mental hospitals can provide refuge for people with severe mental disorders such as schizophrenia, and they can do it as humanely as possible (Sisti et al., 2015).  References Sisti, D. A., Segal, A. G., & Emanuel, E. J. (2015). Improving long-term psychiatric care: bring back the asylum. Jama, 313(3), 243-244. The California Department of State Hospitals: 2018 Annual Report"
339,"Hi Briana, Thanks for your post and questions. State hospitals are important in mitigating the risk of recidivism for people with mental illness. People with mental illness have the same probability of being violent as those in the general population. However, when you combine mental illness with social disadvantages such as exposure to trauma, drug use, and poverty over their life-time, it's a perfect recipe for violent behavior (Swanson et al., 2015). Severe mental illness and external symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, or problems with anger coupled with the wrong environmental circumstances can also greatly increase the risk of violence, while taking medication for these symptoms can reduce it. Therefore, the role of state hospitals in curbing recidivism for those PWMI is extremely important as they help with medication adherence and they provide help with reintegration into the community (Sisti et al., 2015). Just by looking at the individual's circumstances and what kind of life they'd be returning to after incarceration can give mental health professionals adequate knowledge to determine their chances of recidivism. References Swanson, J. W., McGinty, E. E., Fazel, S., & Mays, V. M. (2015). Mental illness and reduction of gun violence and suicide: bringing epidemiologic research to policy.  Annals of epidemiology,  25(5), 366-376. Sisti, D. A., Segal, A. G., & Emanuel, E. J. (2015). Improving long-term psychiatric care: bring back the asylum.  Jama,  313(3), 243-244."
340,"Hi Caroline,  Thanks for your post. Having a mental illness and a co-occurring disease like substance abuse disorder increases the chances of violence and recidivism. Being exposed to trauma and violence, or social disadvantages like poverty and unemployment when you have a mental illness also increase the rate of recidivism and creates a perfect storm for violent behavior against others or oneself. This is why I believe that PWMI shouldn't be in prison, because prison is an environment full of violence, victimization, drug use, and lack of treatment for PWMI. State hospitals wouldn't just provide refuge, they would also provide care. By helping PWMI adhere to their medication in state hospitals-as opposed to prison where they're free to reject it, therefore increasing their chances of illegal drug use which can exacerbate symptoms- and helping them transition into life back into the community with treatment. Yes, you're right when you say forensic psychologists should come up with a way to reform both systems, but they haven't, and until then, I don't believe putting PWMI in prison helps them receive the treatment they need to keep themselves and society safe once they're released.  References Sisti, D. A., Segal, A. G., & Emanuel, E. J. (2015). Improving long-term psychiatric care: bring back the asylum. Jama, 313(3), 243-244."
341,"Data sharing is crucial to targeting those who have mental illness early on before they're fully entrenched in the system. A problem is when data sharing is used to persecute someone. For instance, the video mentions that sharing someone's substance abuse history is not allowed because the police would be alerted and the person could get in legal troubles. However, this kind of knowledge is important so the person can get treatment for substance abuse disorder. A major shift in the decriminalization of drugs would have to happen for that not to be an issue. Data sharing should be increased, however, police should not be able to use mental health issues in a negative way."
342,"It appears to be therapeutic and helpful versus aggressive and/or defensive. Instead of immediately classifying someone as a threat, as with most routine law enforcement encounters, CIT aims to de-escalate, listen, understand, and redirect the person to the appropriate resources. I believe CIT should be implemented everywhere and it should be mandatory training for all officers, not just a select few who are considered more apt. CIT helps officers become more empathetic and people want to feel listened to and understood. This will prevent all kinds of violent encounters."
343,"The lack of education of PWMI, their symptoms, background, and how their mental illness affects their brain makes it easier for the corrections department to treat them without proper care. Because prisons are punitive environments and people with mental illness don't follow rules or procedures as well as someone without a mental illness, guards and staff ignorantly treat them as they would any defiant inmate. However, once they learn about PWMI, they're better equipped to deal with them. Therefore, it takes hitting rock bottom (legal action) to create policy for change."
344,"Although the workers in the video felt safe working in prison, safety is an issue that they may have to deal with. Even though the mental health workers are around others  that can help them in case of a safety issue, there's always the risk that someone may be violent. Just how prison staff and police officers should be trained on mental health conditions, the mental health workers should also be trained on how to respond in violent situations, therefore cross-training is very important. Another issue they might face is if the guards are not on the same page as far as therapy versus punishment. In order for the inmate to recover and believe in his therapy, there has to be humane treatment from everyone in the prison, including staff and inmates -which may be more challenging."
345,"As discussed in the Parker article, the first step that must happen in order to change the treatment of PWMI in the criminal justice system is the crisis intervention training of police officers. Officers are usually the first on the scene and they have a huge amount of discretion in how their contact with a PWMI unfolds. According to Parker (2009), many officers that don't go through CIT don't feel ready or prepared to respond to mental health situations, which makes sense considering their roles of crime-fighters and not mental health specialists. CIT trains officers on the symptoms of mental illness so they can identify those who have it, de-escalation techniques to avoid violent encounters, co-occurring conditions such as substance abuse disorder which is very prevalent, treatment options, and importantly mental health resources. One of the issues is that CIT has not been implemented in every jurisdiction and those who have it don't necessarily train all the police officers, but only those who they deem to be the most trainable. CIT should be mandatory training because it increases officer empathy, reduces arrest rates of PWMI, and increases linkage to mental health resources. The other problem is the lack of collaboration between agencies in certain jurisdictions. If a CIT trained officer is ready to send a PWMI to a mental health center but the center refuses to collaborate, there's only so much the officer can do.  This leads me to the point that mental health actors should be trained on the corrections and legal aspect side in order to fully collaborate with police in the treatment of PWMI. One of the issues on the side of mental health providers is that clinicians feel that police are lacking in knowledge of PWMI and can therefore make situations worse (Parker, 2009). So increasing the trust that mental health professionals have in the police, informing them about CIT, and bringing mental health professionals into CIT programs to teach classes or otherwise collaborate in police training is essential. Prison and jail guards should also be trained on mental health conditions, symptoms, treatment, and de-escalation techniques. The fact that guards brutalize inmates is well known and not uncommon. Prison guard brutality should be heavily sanctioned. The guards have the opportunity to change an inmate's life positively or negatively, and physical violence will definitely worsen mental health conditions or even help create them for th"
346,"Hi Nani, I also talked about lack of trust as being a major contributor to mental health professionals and corrections players not collaborating. Trust and communication are essential so that both sides are aware of what the other knows, and if someone is missing crucial knowledge, the other side can fill in the gap. The Parker (2009) article touched upon the trust issue and how mental health professionals don't trust law enforcement and think they can make the situation with a PWMI worse. However, if both sides are properly trained and they frequently interact together in an educational and practical setting, trust will increase. Since CIT training is aimed to increase officer empathy, teach de-escalation techniques and overall improve knowledge of mental health conditions, mental health professionals should have the same kind of training regarding corrections and the legal system. Mental health and law enforcement are seen as two very different subjects with contradictory belief systems: therapeutic versus punitive. However, CIT training and the capacitation of mental health professionals in terms of policing helps fuse the two in order to best help people with mental illness. Great post! Parker, G. F. (2009). Impact of a mental health training course for correctional officers on a special housing unit.  Psychiatric Services,  60(5), 640-645."
347,"Hi Serenity, I really enjoyed the thoroughness of your post. I agree that intake of PWMI when entering prisons is crucial. The fact that many PWMI will not be reporting their mental health issues at intake makes it very important that there are adequate mental health professionals there to do it. Also, prison guards must be trained on how to recognize the signs, symptoms, and de-escalation methods of PWMI because while not all prisoners will have a mental health illness, many will develop it. Many PWMI's mental conditions will also fluctuate during their stay in prison so it's imperative that guards know what to look out for. Related to this is the humane treatment of all inmates in prison but particularly PWMI who are more apt to disobey prison rules and even succumb to violence (Jacobs, 2004). You made an excellent point when you mentioned the rights of PWMI. When prison guard brutality or mistreatment happens, it's a way of stepping on human rights and if people are aware of others' rights and the sanctions they will receive for not respecting them, their may be a change in the way PWMI are treated in prison and in the outside world. References Jacobs, A. (2004). Prison power corrupts absolutely: Exploring the phenomenon of prison guard brutality and the need to develop a system of accountability.  Cal. WL Rev.,  41, 277."
348,"I think they focus on the non-violent offender because it's easier, people who have mental illness and aren't violent really just need to be diverted to treatment as soon as possible to avoid victimization in prison and jails. A violent person may need different interventions and treatment than a non-violent PWMI. I believe violent offenders need treatment as well, but they should be kept separate from those PWMI who are not violent, due to the fact that the non-violent ones run the risk of victimization at the hands of the violent PWMI. Violent PWMI need some kind of corrections in addition to treatment, however, it should be humane and should include CBT to curb violent behaviors."
349,"I think mental health agencies have a more difficult task because they have to incorporate treatment and community integration into their services. Community integration covers a wide span, such as case management, medication, employment, education, support, advocacy, etc. Therefore, a lot of coordination with different agencies is necessary in order to achieve success. Criminal justice agencies have to establish a smaller scale of these same services within prisons and jails and coordinate with release programs. "
350,"The justice system would know how to better identify those who have mental illness and substance abuse disorders, since many times it's a source of confusion. Mental illness and substance abuse are two different disorders and its important to know how to differentiate them, the incidence of their reoccurrence, and how to treat both separately and as a unit. The justice system would also be better equipped to offer intervention and be knowledgable about the different treatment options. If corrections is aware of the symptoms of substance abuse in addition to mental illness, there may be fewer arrests of people with these co-occurring disorders and more referral to community treatment and substance abuse programs that work in unison and treat both disorders individually."
351,"Peer mentoring allow PWMI to hear what others with mental illness went through, how they dealt with people's reactions to their mental illness, and also how they overcame the institutionalized stigma that is prevalent in society in terms of finding housing -how to find access to resources-, employment, and healthcare. PWMI may be more open to sharing their feelings, thoughts, and challenges with another person who's been through a similar situation."
352,"According to Munetz and Teller (2003), the bulk of the recommendations set forth by the American College of Physicians are to integrate mental health care with primary care. The main points included in the integration of mental health care are 1- having primary care doctors address mental health, 2- removing payment barriers, 3- strengthening non-discrimination policies, 4- streamlining the most effective treatment and integration approaches, 5- providing continuing education and cross-training for mental health and primary care physicians and 6- reducing stigma held by the general population and the medical community. These points can also aim to reinforce integration of mental and physical health within the correctional system  only if the physicians working for the managed care organizations are on board with the rest of the medical community and if they're upheld to the same ethical standards. Due to the high prevalence of people with mental illness in jails and prisons and the shortage of community treatment services and mental services in prison, the integration of mental health into primary care is essential.  If primary care physicians are cross-trained regarding mental illness and are given the tools to reduce their stigma and treat PWMI holistically, people with mental illness in prison will greatly benefit. This will help cover the gap of the shortage of mental health professionals and adequate treatment in the corrections system. Since many PWMI in the criminal justice system also have co-occurring disorders such as substance abuse disorder, fusing  knowledge of mental illness and substance abuse disorders in the corrections system and the outside world will allow easier identification of these disorders and how to treat them. Therefore, prison primary care doctors will learn how to effectively apply evidenced based psychological treatment to help target and treat all disorders effectively (Crowley & Kirschner, 2015).

353,"Hi Steve, You made a few excellent points in your post. First of all, you mentioned that doctors get trained in their respective specialties and lose sight of the patient's holistic health. While specialization is necessary, the integration of behavioral health or mental health into primary care will allow physicians to have a more comprehensive view of the patient and will therefore be able to provide better recommendations and treatment. Sometimes a patient will exhibit physical symptoms, and a specialized physician will fail to see the root of the problem because it won't fit with their medical hypothesis. However, by cross-training all physicians in mental and behavioral health, they may see that they cause of this physical ailment is in fact rooted in a psychological or psychiatric issue (Crowley & Kirschner, 2015). The other great point you made is that by integrating behavioral/mental health with physical health, we're reducing stigma because we're not assigning a greater value to physical health. By considering mental health as part of and as important as physical health, people will stop being ashamed of having a mental health problem as more people will be screened and accurately diagnosed. This will also allow physicians to reduce their stigma regarding mental illness (Crowley & Kirschner, 2015). References Crowley, R. A., & Kirschner, N. (2015).

Annals of Internal Medicine,  163(4), 298-299."
354,"Hi Briana, I had not thought about the great point you made as well. Integrating mental/behavioral health with primary health will require a change as far as insurance policies and procedures. Many times, mental health is billed differently than physical health. For example, many insurance companies won't cover some basic mental health services such as therapy, when they're delivered by a Marriage and Family Therapist, but the same treatment will be covered if that person goes to a psychologist (Dormond & Afayee, 2016). There are many billing and insurance coverage discrepancies between different mental health professionals such as MFT's, psychologists, and social workers. So in order to fully integrate mental/behavioral health with physical health and allow cross-training of physicians with these different professions, insurance companies must be on the same page. One of the goals suggested by Crowley and Kirschner (2015) is to remove payment barriers that prevent this integration, and forcing insurance companies to be consistent in their billing practices regarding mental health will aid in this goals. Another goal mentioned by Crowley and Kirschner (2015) related to the insurance inconsistencies is to make nondiscrimination laws regarding mental health stronger. This means that insurance companies should consider mental health as being equally important to physical health, especially since many physical diseases are rooted in mental health issues.

355,"Hi Christie, Integrating mental/behavioral health with primary health will allow better treatment outcomes for those struggling with mental illness. Not only will cross-training ensure that primary care physicians are able to better identify and screen mental health problems, but working in an collaborative setting, -primary care doctors with mental health professionals- permits all the healthcare professionals to work as a team.   There is proof that the evidenced-based treatment of using diagnostic tools such as the Patient Health Questionnaire, the collaboration of a mental health care manager and the consultation of a psychiatrist helps adjust treatment for PWMI and encourages communication; basically, medical and mental health professionals work as a team and this improves treatment outcomes (Crowley & Kirschner, 2015).   References Crowley, R. A., & Kirschner, N. (2015).

356,"Hi Steve, I absolutely think that mental health specialists should be the ones to administer treatment to those struggling with mental illness.  I believe cross-training is particularly important in the identification of mental illness and some knowledge of treatment would also come in handy in efforts to increase understanding of the disorder. However, I believe there should be a collaboration among cross-trained primary care physicians and mental health professionals, who will have the ""final say"" as far as the best evidenced-based treatment for the specific mental illness. This isn't to say primary care physicians or generalists will replace mental health specialists, but cross-training will ensure better collaborative team work and understanding of the disease.   References Crowley, R.

357,"The main problem I encountered while watching the video was the lack of qualified/trained staff available in the prison to meet Timothy's needs or even to identify his symptoms.  Had there been a trained and prepared individual on staff perhaps Timothy's death would not have occurred, but rather, he would have been transferred to a hospital for treatment.  Additionally, the staff indicated that Timothy had rejected the water he was being offered, after 4 days, I would like to think the staff would have taken it upon themselves to ensure Timothy (or any inmate for that matter) would receive the necessary liquids needed to sway any chance of dehydration.  Not only that, but the staff were aware of the high temperatures the solitary confinement cells could reach, as such, it should have been a priority on their lists to ensure the inmates physical safety and well-being while in their care in those conditions.    There is also the separate matter of the conditions Timothy was kept on the incited his aggressive behavior.  Having him tied for hours on end when it is against procedure to have inmates chained for more than a few hour was also a major issue as being chained aggravated and placed Timothy in an uncooperative mood.  Again, this issue relates to the untrained staff that were available."
358,"Clara, Your analysis and approach to the posed question was not one I had considered.  Like Stephanie mentioned above, I too focused on what could have been done differently  while he was in prison and not what could have been done before during his earlier life when he began showing symptoms.  Your approach encourages one to ask many ""what if"" questions - for example, had there been a medical history/file available for the prison to review post-arrest, would the staff's approach to Timothy as an inmate have been different?  If so, would his death have been prevented?  Another question is also raised, if Timothy would have received adequate treatment during his youth, would this have curved any criminal behavior that landed him in prison to begin with?    It is hard to predict what would have happened or if early treatment would have prevented Timothy's shoplifting.  Irregardless, the prison's lack of trained personnel did contribute to the medical neglect Timothy faced while in prison. Perhaps if there had been a trained medical staff available, Timothy would not have suffered the fate he did."
359,"Aside from the medical considerations that are evaluated when determining treatment and care for the mentally ill, it is important to discuss and also evaluate the non-medical considerations that may apply - both general and case-specific.  Some non-medical consideration to consider would be socialization or the ability thereof.  In an individual is suffering from a mental illness that inhibits their ability to have meaningful and functional interactions with it their communities, then treatment may be recommended for the purpose of facilitated this. Other non-medical considerations would be that of criminality - does their mental illness make them more susceptible to criminal behavior, and if offered/given treatment, could this potentially result in decrease or end to the criminal behavior?  The main purpose of treatment is health, however, one can argue that another purpose would be societal functionality which is brought about by considering the non-medical considerations.  Why, aside from medical factors, is it important for someone to receive treatment/care for their mental illness? The answer could be to ensure public safety and personal fulfillment within society."
360,"The existence of a national registry of mentally ill persons would have no effect on reducing gun violence, period.  The lecture videos and testimonies indicate the percentage of violence/gun violence committed by a person with mental illnesses are rare and minuscule.  Given this fact, I do not believe the benefits a registry for this population would offer outweigh the costs. In the contrary, I do believe the costs far exceed any potential benefits it could bring about.  Not only would a registry prove irrelevant given the small percentage of mentally ill people who are violent but it could potentially serve as a source for further stigmatization and alienation  for these individuals.  Additionally, if this database were to be publicly available, that could also be a breach in patient confidentiality and be a cause for ethical concerns.  This could result in people with mental illness refusing to seek treatment out of fear of being placed in a registry that could lead to problems - problems similar to Lynnette Phillips' when she was admitted as a 5150 and became a prohibited persons list. Another major issue that could result would be in the setup and maintenance of this database and how much it would cost as well as the logistics off it.  Whose job would it be to manage the registry and ensure the registry of those with a mental illness.  Would it be up to the medical professionals who diagnose or would a government office need to be notified to process the registry.  And what will the registry use to define mental illness or what mental illness qualify - the DSM -5? There are a lot of logistical, ethical and overall logical questions that arise when considering a people with mental illness registry, most of which, preclude its establishment."
361,"I agree, the ""better safe than sorry"" mentality can often give people a false sense of hope in that we are doing all that is possible to uphold safety, however, this can prove counterintuitive and more often than not lead to bigger problems.  Throughout history, people with mental illness have been alienated and stigmatized by society as a result of their perceived ""abnormalities"" , however, creating a database and making people register for the sole purpose of being ""better safe than sorry"" is simply not justified.  "
362,"One important problem is society's ignorance towards PWMI or mental illnesses in general.  If there was more widespread education on mental illness and the association, or lack thereof, of mental illness and violence/crime then perhaps the stigma and/or fear would decrease.  By reducing instances of alienation as a result of education, people would be more willing to provide the things PWMI need as depicted by Crystal Dieleman in the Mental Health and Criminal Justice TEDTalk.  "
363,"Hi Danielle, Though I agree with your idea of better training, I do not necessarily agree with it being under or while in prison.  As described in the lecture videos, PWMI are less likely and only amount to a small percentage of people who commit violent acts or crimes.  As Crystal indicated in the TEDTalk, 40% of police contact with PWMI are for non-criminal behavior.  The fact that PWMI are being processed in the CJS is not only a flaw in the system in general but can also be counter-productive for treatment.  I believe there should be better trained staff and funding earlier on in a PWMI's life - perhaps in schools wherein trained personnel are able to identify symptoms and refer people doctors for proper diagnosis and treatment.   "
364,"People with mental illness (PWMI) have been predominately viewed throughout history as outsiders and dangerous, often being sentenced to lives of seclusion and isolation from the rest of society.  Early treatment would focus on ""fixing"" PWMI rather than treating them - which resulted in invasive treatments such as trephination, physical abuse and spiritual purges.  This left PWMI with little if any sense of autonomy and self-determination;  PWMI's decision-making rights were left to those dubbed their guardians and/or governmental figures who were said to have their best interests at heart.   As for the public's willingness to consider them full-fledged  members of society, though the stigmatization has considerably gone down, there is still public reservations about PWMI - most specifically, when it involves the media. At any given moment and with any given violent act, the media tends to associate and or rise the issue of mental illness in relation to the violence (Beck, 2016).  Whether or not it applies to the suspect(s), mental illness is always a subject that is broached by the public and media news outlets. Now, I do feel that there is more acceptance and understanding towards mental illness in the present day, however, I also think there is a certain degree of social apprehension and PWMI villainization.    "
365,"Briana,  Yes -  the TedTalk depicts the ""us and them"" mentality in support of a lingering sense of fear and uneasiness towards PWMI.  And though treatment for mental illness has substantially changed and evolved from what it was - physical, psychological and emotional abuse - the transition of PWMI into the criminal justice system may provide a different type of inadequate care."
366,"Liisa, I liked how you incorporated the need for social interaction in relation to meaningful relationships and how PWMI lack this given the publics' disengagement.  Treatment for PWMI isn't strictly medical but social as well - perhaps if social acceptance was greater, then the issues PWMI face today would decrease."
367,"I believe the most important approach a president could have that would end stigmatization was exactly what President Obama suggested in the video - to go beyond simply starting the conversation and focus on elevating it by having meaningful, fruitful discussions about it.  By opening the ground to a more open and inclusive environment rather than succumbing to the 1900s approach favoring isolation and secrecy, this approach would provide the educational component that has long been missing in the conversation of mental illness.  Additionally, publicly speaking about mental illness and treatment would also serve as a measure to normalize it - this in turn would reduce the knee-jerk reaction some may have in wanting to keep their mental illness hidden for fear of vilification and/or socially rejected. Another approach a president should have to reduce stigmatization would be to publicly support and actively participate in events concerning mental illness or invite key stakeholders within the mental health community to speak at governmental events.  Giving the mental health community a strong and widespread platform that only a president could provide, the conversation would reach the elevation level needed to promote comprehensive change."
368,"Denise I couldn't agree more and this is one of my suggestions.  After reading your post, however, I also found that consistency is very important to promote change.  Bringing up mental health once in an event or simply using it as a vice to garner more support for re-election (or what have you) is not the way it should be addressed.  I believe the president should be committed to mental health and elevating the conversation - this should be done through repeated conversations."
369,The callous attitude and complete disregard for the needs of those within the mental health community (both patients and provider) is evident.  Policymakers who choose to cut funding from the needs of this population simply do not believe there is an overt need for it.  It is hard to identify their position - if they don't understand the magnitude of the problem or if they simply don't care.  
370,"Asia, I agree with your analysis.  Dismissing PWMI and their needs sends the message that they are simply not a priority and that what they are going through is not of great consequence. This message, as you mentioned, perpetuates the stigma."
371,"One alternative to psychiatric drug medication could be group and/or individual therapy as mentioned by the infantryman in the video.  Having an opportunity to discus and share their collective and individualized experiences may provide servicemen mutual understanding and validation for what they have been through.   Now, for active military men, I would suggest psychiatric screenings on the field after potentially traumatizing events.  There should be available military psychiatrists/psychologists available to intervene, as appropriate, for those who may show signs of higher vulnerability. I understand the logistics for this option may not be possible given the nature of the environment, but if it possible, it may provide servicemen with the intervention they need before ending their terms."
372,"Exactly - being able to share on an experiences or even similar trauma provides an environment of understanding and openness.  Also, the lack of perceived judgment may encourage veterans to address their issues in a more forward manner if they are speaking with others who have gone through similar if not the same experiences and exposure they have been."
373,"Unless a person has proven to be a danger to themselves or others, I don't not believe society should intervene.  Last week we spoke about PWMI losing control over their lives, choices and autonomy as it relates to their mental health.  Stepping in and making the decisions for PWMI would only serve to perpetuate the belief that they are unable to care for themselves which then further endorses negative stigmatization.  If a PWMI is violent or a danger, then yes, society should step in to maintain public safety.  But it should only be under these or other extreme or unique circumstances are other or PWMI themselves could be hurt or at risk."
374,"Alyse, I agree.  Taking away their autonomy will do nothing to promote positivity and inclusion with the PWMI population.  In doing so, it may reiterate the belief that PWMI are incapable of fending for themselves."
375,"The main goal would be to normalize mental illness and not treat it as something one has to stay away from; oftentimes, I see parents and/or authority figures ignore teachable moments rather than take the time to explain or approach a certain topics. Instead of cowering away from what is unknown or what one believes to be abnormal, being honest with a child about what they will encounter in life and preparing them to navigate through it intelligently is the only way to nurture acceptance and empathy in future generations.  In addition to taking advantage of teachable moments in regular life for parents, I do feel that the educational system should also be proactive in education students on inclusion and awareness towards to the community they are a part of.  In High School, I remember having a Life Skills class that did not really broach any life skills topics, but rather, serves as an elongated homeroom where we watched movies or did assignments for other class.  Instead of having classes that are not beneficial to students, perhaps having a class on community engagement wherein topics that exemplify community diversity could serve as a conduit for exposing and educating students on topics such as mental illness.  School could also take measures in promoting mental health by having announcements or events wherein stakeholders of the mental health community have an opportunity to go to schools and present.  There could be events where resources are shared and workshops are given with the goal of promoting educational facets on the topic. Another way schools can normalize mental illness would be to add it to their regular curriculum.  For example, in art classes, teachers can give background information on artists who perhaps were affected by mental illness.  Vincent Van Gogh, a 1800s post-impressionist artist, suffered with mental illness during his life and would often personify his mental illness in his paintings.  The famous painting  Starry Night artfully depicted his view from the window of his room at Saint-Remy-de-Provence lunatic asylum.  In using existent classroom classes and topics to present mental health/illness, school systems would facilitate inclusion and awareness.  Student would be exposed to historical figures who battled with mental illness but were able to change/influence their fields in a meaningful positive way.  This would take away from the negative stigma, feeling of incompetency and fear of rejection f"
376,"Carolyn, Thank you for sharing your experience as a school counselor as it relates to students and parents.  Sometimes, I feel, the greatest problem is not educating student so much as it is educating parents on issues that they may not be completely knowledgeable about.  As you said, children spend a significantly higher percentage of their time with families, as such, the things they learned at home are reduced to what their parents know and/or what they were exposed to in their own education.  Perhaps schools could take a proactive approach and provide educational opportunities for parents in the form of workshops and/or take-home reading material regarding major issues, one of them being, mental illness.  Though I know the logistics of this may not be ideal if you have working class parents who do not have the time availability to attend these workshops,  perhaps offering this tool may pave the way for other methods that could reach a more widespread parent population."
377,"Suzanna,  I completely agree.  Lessons are internalization at higher levels with coupled with active, fun engagement.  Your suggestions are ones I had not considered, but once analyzed, do feel would work for the younger student population.  I remember during grade school we would have Scholastic Book Fairs wherein authors would come in a read their books or we would have fun workshops related too specific book topics - integrated mental health and mental illness awareness in events such as these would promote and create a permanence in students with these topics.  Additionally, and as you mentioned, student who learn something through engaging means would ultimately take these lesson home and potentially create learning, teachable moments their parents could benefit from thus making a fun lesson reach bigger audiences."
378,"Given that civil commitment directly relates to the prediction of future behavior, the accuracy of tests are imperative in order to accurately and efficiently identify potentiality towards violence.  For example, if a person underwent a test and received a False Positive, it could result in an individual incorrectly being labeled as a PWMI who is predicated to have a problem, when truthfully, they may pose no problem at all.  These could lead to a lot of people being civilly committed with no true or accurate test to back that up.  As for a False Negative, it could potentially lead to a person who does have a mental illness, incorrectly labeled as one who does not pose a problem.  That is to say that PWMI who could be problematic are not considered so, all the while having a high potentiality toward being a problem.  "
379,"In all honesty, it is difficult to determine if involuntary commitment is the correct determination  when a sex offender completes their sentences.  On one hand, they served their punishment, so why continue to imprison them under the guise of treatment.  This approach could almost seem unfair when you look at the situation objectively and by legal standards.  However, when considering the nature of the crime for which they served time, one can understand the need to ensure public safety and maintain these individuals well supervised and controlled.  Does the benefits of keeping the committed outweigh the potential risks of releasing them?   When considering both approaches, I do feel that individuals should not be indeterminately held, however, I do also feel measures should be taken so that an individual with a high probability towards recidivism is not set free.  As such, perhaps implementing post-sentence completion evaluations by trained staff in order to ensure they are not risks.  And though I understand that predictions are simply that, predictions, and that it does not guarantee actions, it is better to be safe a sorry.  Maintaining public safety should be of utmost importance."
380,"To an extend, yes.  When using inpatient and/or outpatient commitment, states are essentially exercising control over the individuals who are considered dangerous or incapable of fending for themselves thus taking a  parens patria role.  When taking these measures, the states' assume authority over these individuals life - what they will be eating, where they will be living and the treatment they need to curve their behavior into one that is more socially beneficial or appropriate.  The state can then, through these commitments, decide what next to do with individuals - or, whether or not they are capable of re-assuming authority over their own lives after treatment of or if continued treatment is optimal.   As we saw in our lecture video title ""Due Process"", we were able to see how the state maintained authority over the individuals' liberties in after completing criminal sentences by continuing their authority over them in commitment facilities."
381,"The success levels of both inpatient and outpatient involuntary commitment differs in that both offer varying benefits and costs.  For example, inpatient commitment tends to be controversial as it is viewed as coercive and forceful (Swanson et. al., 2009).  When considering the individual, one may make the point that such treatment and deprivation of liberties may have a counter-intuitive effect that could lead to lack of treatment success.  This anti-therapeutic approach may lead to negative outcomes that damage rather than help the individual.  As far as how it impacts society, by committed individuals to inpatient treatment, this could result in stigmatization upon their release that could further hurt them in seeking the help they need post-commitment.   As for outpatient commitment, this approach seems to result in positive results in individuals as it results in positive treatment effects (Swanson et. al., 2009).  Although there is criticisms associated in outpatient commitment in that it also includes coercion and deprivation of civil liberties, it use has had more positive outcomes than inpatient commitment.  One positive result  has been seen in that those who were submitted to outpatient commitment experienced a better quality of life, declined homelessness and decreased criminal victimization (Slate, 2009).  This then has positive effect on society as a whole as these individuals are able to become functional members of society."
382,"Robert, You are correct- outpatient commitment allows for individuals to receive treatment while at the same time maintaining their connection with society.  Despite the restrictions placed on them, they are able to live their lives with others as opposed to inpatient commitments where individuals are forced to live and interact only with those who they are in the inpatient facility with.  This could attest to the positive factors afforded to outpatient commitment - receiving treatment while being giving the opportunity to stay within society is conducive towards positive effects."
383,"Dennis, As shown in your analysis, though both inpatient and outpatient commitments their negative caveats, outpatient commitment appears to be the ideal choice between the two.  Providing individuals with a less restrictive approach to receiving treatment enables them to positively integrate back into society when released.  Inpatient commitment does not offer this opportunity as individuals are forced to abide by inpatient regulations and policies - this is counterproductive in treatment."
384,"Every step of the CJ Process is difficult for PWMI to navigate, however, the one I believe to be the most difficult is the Corrections stage.  Once someone is incarcerated, they are treated as criminals and oftentimes have their rights neglected. The reality is that the CJS, and consequently the corrections stage, was not structured to cater to the health/social/psychological needs of PWMI.  As such, their time in prison/jail and the ""you are a criminal"" treatment they receive from staff is not beneficial towards maintain their mental health while incarcerated, on the contrary, it could potentially further deteriorate their condition which could have adverse effects. PWMI could face additional stigmatization while in prison from both staff and other convicts and be targeted as a result their mental illness.  Not only this, if staff are not adequately trained, abnormal behavior from a PWMI could potentially be taken as a safety concern and lead to solitary confinement or in-prison sanctions. Much like the case of Timothy Souders who suffered from mental illness and died while in custody, if staff are not equipped/trained to identify symptoms, it could lead to disastrous consequences."
385,"A few of the challenges PWMI could encounter as a result of California's correction changes could be that of not receive the appropriate mental help they receive.  As stated in our lecture videos, in transitioning inmates from state prisons to local jails there has been a rise of jail populations which leads to lack of mental/medical resources.  Additionally, budget cuts also affect jail resources thus consequently reducing the aid needed by inmates. On the other hand, a huge benefit to PWMI in this legislative transition is that there could potentially be less PWMI being incarcerated for felonies (property/drug crimes) and instead be sent to jail for misdemeanors.  This could reduce the time spent incarcerated.  Additionally, changes made toward probation violation in that violators are no longer being sent to prison after 1st violation can greatly benefit PWMI.  If PWMI had a probation violation, instead of being sent back to jail/prison, they would be given a community sanction thus making mental health more readily available."
386,"The reality is the police officers are first-responders for every and all situations, as such, its hard to state whether that is fair or not.  If we consider this question as police officers involving a fire or bomb we would not bring up the question of fairness even though they will not be the ones dealing with the situation.  After they are there, then they will call the appropriate agency to navigate the problem  - fire department or bomb squad.  The issue, as stated in our lecture video, is that police find it easier to process PWMI through the CJS as opposed as contact a mental health professional who could, with specialized training and resources, assist the PWMI in getting the help that they need. I see police officers serving as first responders to PWMI as part of the job description.  More often then not police officers are made to deal with situations that are not conventional or that are unique in their own way, as such, the manner in which they respond or meet the situation that is important."
387,"The Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) provides police officers with training and conflict resolution/de-escalation techniques that not only benefits them in knowing how to react and treat PWMI.  CIT also presents police officers with an opportunity to truly understand PWMI as to better understand them, their condition and their needs.  This, in turn, allows police officers to humanize PWMI rather than see them as someone who is hostile or criminal.  As a result, CIT training reduces stigmatization by police towards PWMI."
388,"According to Taheri (2016), there are no statistically significant data that supports the belief CIT trainings are effective.  Teheri's systematic review of past studies gives no indication that CIT reduce officer injury, arrest outcomes and use of force by law enforcement officers.  However, despite the lack of statistical support, it appears that one major limitation of CIT studies is in the methodology adopted by researchers - where ones relied on officer self-reporting, others relied on the reviewal of existing databases.  Taheri found that there are significant variations in data dependent on the methodology used; data that resulting from self-reporting could have been affected by underreporting by officers thus providing inconsistent or skewed data.  This paired with differences in CIT also contribute to variability in data-recording.  Another major limitation of Taheri’s analysis is in the number of studies available for analysis – the lack of studies are not enough to provide sufficient information that supports or opposes the effectiveness of CIT.  Now, when considering the lack of studies available and the high-level of variability between them, it is made that much more difficult to ascertain CIT’s efficacy.   Considering Taheri’s findings and study limitations, I would recommend the continued use of CIT as mental illness training for law enforcement officers.  The use of these specialized response training programs offer officers key training material and response training scenarios that help that better approach PWMI while out in the field.   Some jurisdictions have gone as far as to develop and implement “CIT plus” programs wherein law enforcement officers/police station are paired with a mental health professional who assists them in helping PWMI in a crisis (Slate, 2013).  In customizing CIT programs that cater to the PWMI community, law enforcement agencies are better able to provide proper care and services.   In addition to this, CIT programs also provide an opportunity to decrease stigmatization and misconceptions by law enforcement officers; through training, officer understand the needs of this marginalized community and changes the approach of “you are a criminal and I am going to arrest you” to “you are in a crisis and I am here to help”. Slater (2013) also identifies CIT programs as avenues for bettering future interactions between law enforcement officers and PWMI, their families and the community. "
389,"Jennifer, You are correct - perhaps structuring CIT programs to work for law enforcement in tandem with the community, the efficacy of these programs would rise.   I wonder, however, how realistic or possible this approach is.  Would community involvement be in the form of workshops offered by law enforcement agencies?  Would these programs be offered directly from mental health agencies?  "
390,"Gabriela, You bring up an interesting topic. Calls/information notifying officers about a situation are provided by dispatchers which rises the questions if dispatchers should also undergo some level of CIT program or training that'll help them in their role as information-gatherers.  Considering the dispatch callers can be anyone - victim, witness or suspect - perhaps have dispatchers trained on mental health issues and information-gathering aimed at obtaining mental health information from caller can better prepare law enforcement when arriving at the destination.  Or better yet, arriving at a destination already prepared in the response/interaction that is needed to maintain control."
391,"Watching the video and seeing Sheriff Tom Dart, the authority figure in the jail, state the extent of  the problem is disheartening.  Not only because of the acknowledgment of the issue but also in his inability to do anything about it.  The fact that there is an awareness behind the reasons for incarceration of PWMI -stealing food/necessities and trespassing for the purposes of shelter - makes the underlying issue that much more problematic.  Having PWMI incarceration multiple times, let alone100 times, makes one wonder if incarceration becomes a norm and expectation for PWMI.  And when we consider the reasons behind their arrests, I wonder if being arrested and incarceration becomes a  desired result rather than a punishment; sacrificing their ""freedom"" in exchange for  shelter, food and medication."
392,"Three indicators that I would consider when measuring mental illness in jails would be:   Number of past incarcerations  I would consider the number of past incarcerations as a measure given that it can provide an indication of mental illness.  According to the ""Jails are a New Insane Asylum"" video, Sheriff Tom Dart states that PWMI have higher rates of recidivism and re-incarceration rates, usually for petty crimes - some PWMI been incarceration upwards of 100 times, sometimes more.   2.   Medical history/Medication  A second indicator I think a jail should consider is an individual's medical history through self-reporting or via a structured diagnostic interview.  If there has been a history of psychiatric commitments, psychiatric medications and/or continues medical visits then perhaps a person must be taken a different approach in their incarceration.     3.  Behavior Upon Booking/Admissions A third indicator I would suggest jails use as a MI indicator would be the behavior(s) exhibited by an individual upon admissions into the jail.  If a person is demonstrating abnormal behavior in line with behaviors exhibited by those with mental illness, I do believe this should be documented and this individual should be given medical attention upon admissions to identify any medical issues."
393,"I do not believe there are too many or too few rights afforded to jail inmates in present times.  The current restrictions in place are appropriate when one considers the population that they are applying to.  For the most part, those who are sent to jail committed some type of crime, as such, limiting their rights as they relate to liberty is only natural when incarcerated.  Now, though restricting rights/liberties are to be expected after incarceration, I don't believe that all rights should be terminated - inmates are still humans and should be treated as such.  Incarcerated individuals should be allowed basic human and individual rights such as freedom of religion and speech (so long as it's not harmful)."
394,"The use of medication as opposed of other forms of treatment, despite the significant costs, is simply the easiest treatment for jails to provide.  When one considers the sheer number of inmates in jails and those who require medical assistance, particular due to a mental illness, could prove difficult if we are considering the hundreds who need it.  As such, I believe treatment in the form of medication is simply easier for jail staff to manage.  If jails were to use other forms of treatment, psychotherapeutic treatment for example, the resources may be more difficult to acquire.  "
395,"The use of jails as holding pens for PWMI is not only inappropriate but creates a problem for the criminal justice system it is not prepared or designed to manage.  According to Teplin (2010), approximately 16% of inmates held in prisons and jails have serious mental issues which is significantly more than the 6.4% found in the 1980s.  First and foremost, the funding allocated for the administration and management of these jails simply cannot keep up with the rising costs connected with the influx of inmate population as a result of realignment policies (Lofstrom & Martin, 2015).  Although realignment policies sought to alleviate prison populations by changing sentencing approaches in reducing penalties for drug and property offenses, the changes in charges transferred responsibility to jails.  Jails were now responsible for the inmates who would have been sentenced to time in prison, making them accountable for a greater number of offenders which included higher number of PWMI.  Given the increase in inmate population in jails and thus an increase in costs and need for resources, using jails for the seriously mentally ill is not appropriate given the lack of resources aimed to cater to the PWMI population within the jails. As for architectural appropriateness, jails are also not equipped to handle PWMI as their facilities do not cater to the needs of PWMI. According to Slate (2013), jails are not structured attend the some of the medical needs of PWMI, as such, PWMI are submitted to isolation as the preferred protocol by jail staffers.  This could have detrimental effects for PWMI as it could lead to higher suicide rates and mental health deterioration (e.g., increases anxiety, depression and behavioral problems).  Additionally, jails are often smaller than prisons and can vary in size (Slate, 2013).  This could also lead to mismanaged care for inmates with mental health issues. Jails are also restricted to operational restraints which do not cater to the needs of inmates suffering from mental health issues.  Jails are notoriously known for being understaffed, however, they have become our country’s largest psychiatric institutions (Slate, 2013). Jails are ill-prepared to manage the needs of their PWMI population.  Some staff may not be adequately trained to handle PWMI nor capable to do so given the high-volume of inmates they must oversee.  As such, jails are not the appropriate place to house people with serious mental illness an"
396,"Natalie, I liked how you described jails as ""people processing institutions"" as it an interesting, albeit, realistic way of describing it.  Jails house inmates for less than a year, usually for petty crimes or while someone is waiting for trial.  Jails are not designed or structured to meet the inmate's underlying and fundamental needs, but rather, just holds them for a limited sentence.  Jails simply cycle people through, thus, there is no need for long-term approach towards the needs of their inmates suffering from mental illness.  And I think this is also why there is such an emphasis or reliance on medication as a form of treatment, it's just easier especially if the PWMI is going to be cycled out within the year."
397,"Viviana, You bring up a point I had not considered.  Through realignment, offenders who would usually serve their time in prison are now being sent to jails to serve their time while sharing space with petty criminals and inmates with mental issues.  I wonder if interacting with different criminal types not previously housed in jails creates even worse and inappropriate environment for PWMI. "
398,"Despite the lack of accuracy, I do feel that risk assessment tools serve as predictors, to a certain degree, for potential future criminality based on key factors (i.e., past offenses, behavior analysis etc.). As stated in the Youtube video above, judges rely heavily on the pre-trial/pre-sentencing reports to better approach criminal offenses and criminals on a case-by-case basis.   Now, when considering the ""fairness"" of these tool, I can understand where their use can be arbitrary - how can we possibly predict future behavior or its likelihood based on these factors.  And if used, it could be unfair to punish someone based on future potential criminality that may never come to pass.  However, I do feel that, overall, it is far to use these tools given the population it is applied to.  Better be safe than sorry, and if there are specific indicators that can contribute to the belief that a person will be involved in future crimes, why not use these tools to better prepare for them."
399,"I think mental health professionals would be supportive and receptive for an RNR approach given that it would be a better approach towards PWMI who become involved with the criminal justice system.  Past models and treatment of PWMI within the criminal justice system has been lacking in basic knowledge and has also been ignorant to the needs of PWMI.  Though I am sure mental health professionals would advocate for better treatment than even the RNR approach provides, I'm sure they would believe the RNR approach is a good start to promote change and reform for PWMI in the criminal justice system.  As for other factors that may be of concern besides recidivism, I believe Rehabilitation would be another factor that would be heavily supported by mental health professionals for PWMI under community supervision."
400,"The goals states by Mack Jenkins in the video are ideal, however, I do not believe this is a goal that is carried out effectively or universally across all probation departments.  As stated in our lecture videos, I think the culture wherein probation officers assume the role of law enforcement agents rather than that of rehabilitation changes the dynamic and approach of probation.  The outlook is more towards making sure these criminals follow the rules sanctioned on them as opposed to helping individuals get their life back on track through exposure/access to services.  Another reason why the this mindset is reinforced is because of the sheer amount of people on probation and the courts dependence on it.  It's harder to maintain an individualized case plan when a probation officers case loads are overwhelming - this in turn can also make probation officers less effective in  engaging in the rehabilitative role.  This approach and mindset make it even harder for PWMI to gain access to the treatment they need, however, it is a better option than jail as jail is not an institution that caters to mental health needs, far from it."
401,"Yes - I would prefer a mental health court over a traditional court given that the treatment/rehabilitative needs of those with MI are better met under these courts over the traditional ones.  Unlike the traditional courts, PWMI are more closely monitored and services that apply to them specifically are better met.  If I was a person suffering from a mental illness and I found myself in a situation where I would become a participant in the MHC, I would far prefer it than a traditional court,  "
402,"  The acceptance and move towards the risk-need-responsivity (RNR) approach for the purposes of reduced recidivism is one that has shown promise when applied to people with mental illness in response to their involvement with the criminal justice system.  In implementing and using the RNR approach, courts can proactively match offenders to services based on criminogenic factors in order to reduce criminal recidivism as well as improve public safety (Skeem et al., 2015).  The RNR approach offers courts an opportunity to evaluate an offender and the potential risks they present to society to then determine what approach would be best suited in order to reduce the offender’s chances at recidivism.  By evaluating and addressing the “Big Four” criminogenic factors as stated in our 6.1 video lecture, the belief is that offenders will be less inclined to partake in future crime given that they have received the necessary aid via services that would deter their propensity towards crime. The RNR approach, as a result, appears to be promising given that MI on probation would be benefitted in that they would be matched with services that would directly benefit them in both lowering their likelihood of recidivism but also serve as a channel for rehabilitation through the access of mental health and general services.  This approach, however, has come under scrutiny and criticism given the lack of evidence base to support its use (Skeem et al., 2015). In theory this approach appears to be ideal, but the reality is that this transition from psychiatric services to correctional services may not prove as beneficial as originally believed.  There is little to no empirical evidence that supports its use or its effectiveness and Chief probational officer must not be swayed by perceived benefits over empirical proof of their usefulness.  Another concern that probation departments and probation authority figures should be aware of is the risk that comes from risk assessment tools to determine treatment/punishment, and subsequently, future criminality.  And in addition to this concern, how could risk assessment tools that are meant to be generally applied be applied to PWMI when the needs of the general criminal population when compared to MI criminal population is different and requires a different approach?  Peterson et al. (2014) found that risk assessment tools used on PWMI should include variable risk factors in addition to psychiatric symptoms in order to effect"
403,"Hi Sayla! Loved your response - you hit all the major points wherein RNR may not be effective and your recommendations are well-thought out. I wonder, how do you think your recommendation of the continued use of individualized case plans fare when we consider the amount of individuals on probation (both those who have a MI and those who do not) versus the availability of trained probation officers.  Our lecture video also indicates the culture of probation departments/officers are that closer to the role of law enforcement, how would you address the need for rehabilitation over the criminal approach this cultural mindset that is in place seems to have?"
404,"Stephen, I enjoyed how you presented your response to the discussion in a structured letter that navigates the needs, available information and routes to implementation.  More so, I enjoyed reading your implementation section.  According to our text (Slate et al, 2013), the courts are restricted to the services that are readily available given their inability to create these services based on the need, how would you navigate this limitation?  Also, our lecture video 6.1 provided information on the ""Big Four"" criminogenic factors, what other factors would you consider adding to MI-oriented assessments?"
405,"The prison environment does not cater to rehabilitation. Structurally/architecturally speaking, the prison environment is extremely dull and does not promote a healthy aesthetic that can potentially stimulate PWMI to better themselves.  Living in cages, treated like criminals and being chained does not serve the rehabilitative measure incarceration is suppose to have.  "
406,"I don't think its possible to completely and truly rehabilitate prisoners with mental illness given the way were socialized early in life and how that tends to leave a mark, however, I do feel that strides can be made to facilitate and help them navigate the world in a socially acceptable way - be it through medication and/or other therapeutic measures.  In providing these prisoners with the tools, knowledge and help that they need they will be able to fully integrate into society as productive and self-aware members and participants."
407,"The advantage of solitary confinement (SC) is that it provides a temporary fix for deep-rooted problems within the prison.  If there are fights or behavioral problems from inmates, being sent to SC only helps restore order momentarily.  Prisoners are then let out to face the same issues that may have caused them to be sent to SC, as such, prison staff must find measures to alleviate or fix the problems.  Additionally, I do feel the disadvantages to SC outweigh the advantages by a significant margin.  The mental distress it creates for inmates only serves to cause future problems that prison staff will have to deal with; SC does not solve anything, but rather, postpones trouble (trouble that may be worse later)."
408,"I am not opposed to the reality of my tax dollars paying for mentally ill inmates, however, I am concerned with how they are using the monies to provide this care.  As stated by Josh Evans, if the monies were used to initiate care on a proactive level rather than a reactive one, the monies would be put to better use."
409,"Managing a diverse prison population, particularly one housing people with mental illness who compose 7% to 45% of the federal inmate population and 16% to 56% of the state inmate population (Slate et al., 2013), is a complicated endeavor that requires a full evaluation of resources, budget and security.  In order to maintain a safe and secure environment that caters to the purpose of incarceration – retribution, incapacitation, deterrence and rehabilitation – we must first ensure the availability of trained staff, or correctional officers (Slate et al., 2013).  The role of correctional officers within the prison is to maintain safety, their own as well as the inmates they are responsible for.  In having correctional officers trained not only as law enforcement agents but also as specially trained individuals in mental health concepts, prisons would have a multidisciplinary treatment approach that enables staff to have better techniques when dealing with their mentally ill population (Adams & Ferrandino, 2008).  Prison environments are known to be brutal and stressful which can lead to detrimental consequences for inmates, most notably, for inmates suffering from mental illness (Slate et al., 2013).  According to Slate, inmates with mental illness tend to receive higher rates of disciplinary infractions when compared to the rest of the prison population, face victimization while in prison by both other inmates and correctional officers, demonstrate self-injurious behaviors as well as have higher rates of suicide/suicide attempts.  Rather than viewing inmates with mental health issues as security threats, by using a multidisciplinary treatment approach correctional officers are better able to develop a value system between mental health and security.  According to Adams and Ferrandino (2008), by investing in training for officers, prisons will experience significant changes in officer and inmate relationships; that is to say, there will be a substantial decrease in violence between inmates and correctional officers thus promoting prison safety for all.  As for providing treatment to inmates suffering from a mental illness, current laws giving inmates rights minimally adequate treatment which includes mental health treatment access (Slate et al., 2013).  According to Slate, approximately 15% to 20% of inmates require psychiatric intervention during their confinement, a number which has proven difficult to treat.  Current standards permit intak"
410,"Gabriela, Reducing prison population is a solution I did not consider while making my analysis as I focused more on the existing prison population, however, it is the solution that makes the most sense.  It would not only decrease medical/mental health services costs but it would also serve to decrease overall prison operation costs (housing costs, staff-salary costs, maintenance costs etc.).   The fact that the U.S. has the biggest prison population in the world, most inmates incarcerated for illogical sentencing practices, is ridiculous.  And on top of this, we are being drowned in the costs of running these institutions because of those same practices makes it even more ridiculous."
411,"Hi Lisa, Although I like your idea of a more comprehensive intake screening process, I wonder what the budgetary costs this would entail and if it is a feasible option given the sheer number of inmates a prison processes.  Do you think this is an option prison officials would opt for given the massive costs prisons already have?"
412,"Presently, knowing what I know about the need for mental health reform, I don't think I would be in opposition of the construction.  The benefits such an institution poses and the help and attention it will bring for PWMI is exemplary and one many states should mimic.  However, for those who do not understand this or see it as a point for concern, I do feel they would be adamant about having their tax dollars go to such a project; as such, educating the community is a key factor lawmakers should focus on when contracting or proposes building institutions such as these."
413,"No - in previous course in our program, it was stated that the threshold to be categorized as ""legally insane"" is rather high, as such, it takes a lot of evidence in support of insanity for someone to received this label.  And even if someone was labeled legally insane, they are not simply let go, but rather, sentenced to holding in a state hospital where their release is also rare occurrence.  This is why I do not qualify a NGRI sentence as a ""get out of a jail free"", simply put, it is not."
414,"There obviously needs to be safety measures in place to ensure that safety comes before treatment.  As stated int he video, adequate treatment cannot be given if there is instability in safety for both staff and patients.  State hospital administrators must ensure that there is only trained staff in contact with patients and that these staff undergo self-defense training that can be used to overpower and control patients who may be a physical threat; this training can reduce the instanced were patients and staff are harmed.  Other measures would be to hire trained security who are able to intervene in these moments so that no harm comes to staff or patients.  State hospital can also implement restraint measures in the form of sedatives or bed restraints to ensure the immobilization of patients who become a physical threat to others and themselves."
415,"I believe there are certain medical circumstances that may warrant such an invasive procedure - in the case of the patient highlighted in the videos above, her depression reached a point where she felt that not doing the procedure was not an option.  However, I would be apprehensive given the side effects of such a procedure - brain damage, infection and death."
416,"The role of state hospitals, or rather, their use in society has been widespread over the years.  State hospitals have been relied upon by community members who do not have the means of procuring private care due to low financial ability. State hospitals are known to be more affordable than private medical institutions thus increasing their community-based need (Wooster Community Hospital, 2019). Additionally, state hospitals accept most types of insurance providers which offer more flexibility for people making then an optimal and sought out choice for medical care.  According to the California Department of State Hospitals (2018), state hospitals also offer a wider variety of services and programs housed within local jails and prisons which diversifies their patient population.  This in turn has broadened the role of state hospitals to encompass incarcerated populations, specifically noted in the treatment of mental health (Fisher, Geller and Pandiani, 2009).  This increasing reliance of state hospital care has, however, put a strain on state budgets given their 7.7-billion-dollar a year fiscal impact. Now when considering the role of state hospitals, I do believe their role in society should be widespread given their federally funded, public standing.  Simply put, there should be no restrictions on their accessibility.  As they stand, state hospitals have higher bed availability when compared to general hospitals, able to accept a higher number of patients; this includes general medical care as well as mental health treatment (Fisher et al., 2009).  State hospitals are also able to house a diverse population of patients given their ability to maintain multiple units that hold varied security levels.  According the California Department of State Hospitals (2018), the number of patients admitted for mental health treatment, particularly those rereferred from confinement, are on the rise.  This population referred to as “forensic patients”, have increased by significant rates – 50% in Virginia, 281% in Massachusetts, 370% in Pennsylvania and 309% in New York (Fisher et al., 2009).  Despite this high rate in admission rates, I do not believe state hospitals should be used exclusively for this population.  In doing so, state hospitals will see an impact to their budgetary cost given the dependence of federal funding to cover the costs of care for forensic patients.  In additional to this, there will be a need for hiring new trained staff as well a"
417,"Hi Wendy, You mentioned that state hospitals should not be exclusive for ""forensic patients"" only but that these institutions are ideal in treating them.  What solution would you have to this issue?  Do you think the states should establish state hospitals that are  exclusive for this population while maintaining other state hospitals to be accessible to the general public? Additionally, while considering this question, I took the time in analyzing it through the taxpayers perspective. State hospitals, as you mentioned, are a state burden; making it ""forensic patient"" only would only serve to increase this burden relying on taxpayer money to cover the costs of care.  This, on top of the taxpayer not being able to seek medical care in this institution could potentially lead to social uproar and opposition which could be disastrous."
418,"Natalie, You bring up a point I had not considered.  Criminal courts would be at an advantage and hold power of the state hospitals in regards to the status of ""forensic patients"" in the states' hospital care.   This could potentially de-stabilize the relationship of state hospitals and the criminal justice systems making state hospitals a branch of the criminal justice system rather than its own independent agency."
419,"Although the forms of data sharing do appear to be satisfactory, there is always room for improvement.  In the Youtube video presented, Jim Parsons presented an idea wherein a MH professional would cross-check prison/jail records in order to cross check with MH systems to identify PWMI. This is a great approach, however, considering the staff-power that would require, I am not sure how feasible this idea is long-term and overall.  Perhaps creating a system/software wherein a name can be entered upon intake in order to see if there are any ""hits"" on a MH record without providing information on that hit.  If a person was identified as being someone who has interacted with the MH system, perhaps that could prompt a MH professional to visit the jail/prisons in order to complete an evaluation for services.  Having a proactive yet also having a staff-capability conscious approach could provide a way to identify this population and accordingly provide services."
420,"The CIT approach is more aware of the situation and meets it with an open approach rather than a hostile one.  In doing so, officers are able to address the immediate needs of the people they are encountering without relying on force to control the situation where force would be counterproductive to use."
421,"Court orders and/or legal actions validate mental health issues.  Unfortunately, it takes this kind of awareness and identification from legal authorities in order for correctional departments to change their approaches."
422,I believe the caretaking/service providing approach from the mental health professionals often clashes with the punishment/hostile approach from correctional agencies.  Cross training would enable both sides to understand each others role and the ultimate impact on the population that overlaps under their care.
423,"A blended response, as indicated by Judge Janet Holmgreen, is the best approach when dealing with a person with mental illness and although she was referring to this blended response as being in the courtroom, I do feel that a blended response in the field would also be ideal when dealing with PWMI.  Having a blended approach, or cross-trained approach, from both mental health professionals as well as criminal justice actors would not only serve to meet all the needs of people with mental illness when involved in the criminal justice field, but it would also cater the approach from both parties.   Encouraging the need for menta health professionals to understand safety, booking process and police protocols is essential in providing the best mental health care.  If a PWMI finds themselves involved in the criminal justice system, the best way to provide them the care they require is for mental health professionals to understand what they are going through or will go through within the criminal justice system and cater their services as such.  Now, for criminal justice actors, it is important for them to understand the mental health approach with PWMI as it differs significantly from that of others who do not have a mental illness when going through the criminal justice system.  Also understanding the effects that incarceration can have on a PWMI is important knowledge for a criminal justice actor to have.  In understanding this, they are better able to treat the individuals under their supervision – this would reduce instances wherein safety may be jeopardized and mental health could deteriorate (Watson and Fulambarker, 2013).  The reality is that the work of mental health professionals and criminal justice actors is increasingly entangled, as such, a blended approach wherein both field professional has basic or in-depth knowledge of the others work and approach is crucial in providing the best services while maintaining safety.  According to Watson and Fulambarker (2013), about 10% of police contacts involve people with serious mental health issues, as such, it is crucial that criminal justice officers are aware of the needs of a population that interact with.  As for mental health professionals, understanding the protocols and policies of these criminal justice agencies and its actors is crucial in providing the services and care they need within the parameters of their situation."
424,"Robert, You are correct. Adopting a CIT approach that ensures safety, links mental health services and criminal justice protocols and divert PWMI from being processed in the CJ system where more mental health harm could be perpetuated is the goal (Watson and Fulambarker, 2013).  However, I can see where this meshing of trainings is difficult, more so considering the different cultures of associated with the mental health field and the criminal justice field."
425,"Cornise, Having dedicated and recurring instances of training and workshops would not only reduce the instances of excessive force on PWMI from criminal justice actors but it would also change the culture of the criminal justice system's overall approach towards PWMI.  This may even create a chain reaction in the criminal justice field towards those who are processed - making the focus rehabilitation and punishment rather than punishment alone."
426,"I believe the focus is on non-violent offender for these diversion program because of the fact that they may be more receptive to the programs.  Non-violent offenders also have charges that are not as serious compared to this of violent offenders, thus, sentencing them to treatment as opposed to time may be more conducive toward rehabilitation. As for violent offenders, diversion programs would also be advised, however, it should be under more secure settings.  The nature of the offense (violent) may warrant incarceration time and a higher level of supervision than a regular diversion program is capable of offering."
427,"I think they are different.  I believe it is easier for MH agencies as it is something they are accustomed and familiar, however, with CJ agencies it may be a bit more difficult.  One has to consider to existing culture of law enforcement of punishment rather than rehabilitation as well as conflict between the practices and current procedures.  "
428,"The approach and treatment would be more conducive to rehabilitation and reduced instances of relapse.  Establishing and utilizing programs that cater to both mental illness and substance abuse promotes an approach that integrates MI treatment as well as SA treatment.  By combining and unifying the care/treatment to address both concerns, individuals would benefit better due to the fact they are being treated for the co-occurring disorders.  In programs that only address one disorder, the co-occurrence of the other could potentially void the treatment and propel individuals to relapse because the treatment given did not fully grasp and treat the problems."
429,Having a support system that provides support and understanding provides PWMI with an anchor and also with someone they can depend on when faced with obstacles.  Peer mentors are trained individuals that could assist PWMI navigate the world and also serve as a point of contact in times where symptoms may be overwhelming.  This understanding and active awareness by a peer mentor not only lets PWMI  connect with someone who knows about their mental disorder but also engage with them in a nonjudgemental way.  That constant positive reinforcement that and acceptance promotes normalization of mental illness that is needed in society for PWMI to not feel isolated or targeted.
430,"Integrated care as proposed and recommend by the American College of Physicians is difficult to implement given the substantial complexities that may arise.  For starters, procedural and administrative differences between agencies and governmental levels, particularly that of the state, are constrained by regulation (Crowley and Kirschner, 2016).  This regulation often conflicts with the ability of other agencies to effectively provide care as a result of issues with licensing and credentialing.  Differences in approach type and treatment/practice by agencies could also make it difficult to integrate care as there is no uniform method treatment.  Where some institutions use evidence-based practices, which generates a highly effective and common approach, others use research-based and promising practice approaches (Harvey and Gumport, 2015). In order for integration to be effective and produce results, agencies would have to come together and determine what’s the best approach and ensure it is uniformly carried out to promote reliability and validity of treatment.  A second limitation of the integration of these recommendations is the funding and/or payment methods for treatment (Crowley and Kirschner, 2016.  Different agencies use and accept different methods of payment, this in turn can also cause conflict in using integrated care provided by different agencies in that some agencies may receive payment in one form while another may require a different. Individuals not covered by insurance are, when financially capable, forced to purchase insurance in order to pay for services – it is important to note that there are 45 million Americans as of 2015 who do not have access to health insurance. Moreover, individuals who need services are unable to acquire them as it is beyond their means; when going without services is not an option, individuals are forced to navigate different agency’s bureaucratic systems to get funding for these services (Harvey and Gumport 2015).  Another main limitation in these recommendations is in the differing culture of both the criminal justice system and the mental health system.  According to Munetz and Teller (2004) the mental health field’s approach is more team-oriented and who focuses on the illness.  The criminal justice field, on the other hand, has an authoritarian and adversarial approach that focuses on the behaviors of a person with mental illness.  This disconnect in culture and approach renders integration difficul"
431,"Considering the authoritarian and adversarial approach by part of the criminal justice system, do you think these recommendations would work for PWMI who are actively involved in the criminal justice system and not those simply seeking treatment?    "
432,"If we were to consider current regulatory powers hat control mental health providers (and other healthcare agencies) as well as the criminal justice agencies, do you think these regulatory systems cater to the recommendations for integration?"
433,"  Welcome Back Everyone! As many of you know, I am a mom of two crazy yet adorable little boys who will be turning two and four in October and November. As far as my education goes, I am in love with law and psychology. My passion is in the field of psychology, but there is something about studying law that just takes me away. I graduated from Cal State Northridge (CSUN) in 2013. It was there that I met my awesome professor Dr. Bradley McAuliff. There are no words to express how awesome he is, but the impact he made on my life is how I discovered my calling for both psychology and law. I found out that UC Irvine offered the best of both worlds. I applied and by God's grace I made it in. I have experience in mental health as I am a Program Supervisor providing in-home therapy services for children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), emotional disturbance, and other maladaptive behaviors. I also provided 1:1 services and was a teaching assistance at a private school for ASD/Social Skills for over seven years. Before attending UC Irvine, I was at a law school where part of my studying covered learning about mental health and how it was used in the court room. I hope this class will go more in depth and show me things that were not within the scope of law school teachings."
434,"This video was hard to watch, and the words were harder to swallow. Based on the video many things actions could have been taken to prevent the death of Timothy Souders, but the one that stands out the most was getting Souders urgent psychiatric care instead of sending him to prison to receive de facto mental rehabilitation. Lecture 1-1 mentioned that criminal justice practitioners (like the correction officers seen in the video) are untrained and ill-equipped to deal with PWMI (as cited by Human Rights Watch, 2003; Scheyett et al., 2009). It is a shame many PWMI will suffer because most people cannot tell that someone (they come across in their daily life) is actually suffering from a mental disorder  (Slate, Buffington-Vollum and Johnson, 2013). The 60-Minutes video clip discusses this issue as malingering, which is commonly seen in many court cases concerning criminals and insanity pleas. Another prevention method could have been thoroughly following up with any mental health related requests as the video mentioned that the psychiatric doctor was on leave and also that transfer documents never received a follow-up. This leads me to mention another challenge in the criminal justice system that was mentioned in Lecture 1-1 which is that PWMI tend to remain in custody for longer periods of time. Souder’s death could have been prevented simply by receiving proper and adequate care. I am referring to the type of care which upholds the state and federal laws that protect prisoners from receiving maltreatment and gross negligence such as dying from dehydration.  Slate, R., Buffington-Vollum, J. and Johnson, W. (2013). The criminalization of mental illness. 2nd ed. Durham, North Carolina: Carolina Academic Press."
435,"Historically, many non-psychiatrists were the decision-makers for PWMI and this led to misdiagnosis, oppression, maltreatment/abuse and ultimately even death. Lecture 2-1 discussed an intriguing issue where one treatment approach contended that mental illness was due purely to social causes. For example, it was discussed that some women who did not behave like the typical housewife, but instead practiced masturbation or whose sexual desires deviated from the norm were admitted as mentally ill. Lecture 2-1 also highlighted Foucault’s argument that economic factors and cultural interests drive provision of treatment and care. Thomas Szasz was a major critic in his writing of  The Myth of Mental Illness which claimed that Americans used psychiatric coercion, much like Nazi Germany, to silence non-conformists.   Julie Becks article titled  Untangling Gun Violence from Mental Illness is another great example of how non-medical considerations have driven provision of treatment and care for persons with mental illness. This article uses social science evidence to show trends of PWMI being viewed as a violent population by the media and societal views, when actually PWMI are less likely than the average person to be violent. This misperception tends to occur when PWMI are paired with heinous crimes like mass shootings for example. When gun violence occurs, the article mentions that most people attribute the cause to the likelihood that the perpetrator suffered from some sort of mental illness; however, Beck (2016) refutes this using The MacArthur Community Violence Study (1998) and what this study found was that mental illness alone was not a risk factor for violence. Further, it showed that the prevalence of violence among PWMI who had been released from a hospital was actually similar to the average people in the community. Ultimately, PWMI are seen as more violent and this is not the case. Becks states that not only does it make the public feel more negatively toward PWMI—heightening the stigma—but it also leads more PWMI to going untreated because they are trying to avoid being diagnosed with something society views negatively and thus effects the provision of both treatment and care for PWMI."
436,"In terms of reducing gun violence, I do not think the benefits of a national registry of mentally ill persons outweigh the costs (in my opinion). If we refer back to Lesson 1-3's video Mental Illness and Guns, we see there are a few problems that throw off the balance. One example is focusing on the actual social science research that shows that roughly four percent of the violence is attributable to PWMI. That number alone does not support the need and extremities of a national registry of mentally ill persons. Another example is Lynette Phillip's story where it was highlighted that she received a 5150 involuntary hold and thus the removal of any rights to bear arms. While a 5150 hold would seem appropriate considering it is a way to prevent people from harming themselves or others, Lynette voluntarily admitted herself and something went wrong in the paperwork. This mistake should not determine her rights and impact her family in the way that it did. This example highlights the adverse effects of the national registry and also shows that it creates problems that has less to do with reducing gun violence and more on government control and issues highlighted in Thomas Szasz's  Myth of Mental Illness. It honestly seems like this is even a discussion of topic because the availability heuristic is so strong with crimes like mass shootings. No matter the statistical data showing that mental illness is less likely the case, mass media is shifting the minds and impacting public opinion and policy regarding PWMI. What does this mean for those who have not been diagnosed and refuse to seek help to avoid being seen as the next mass shooter? I see harm and benefit; however, I do not see enough benefit to outweigh the costs."
437,"I believe the most important problem to fix is how PWMI are portrayed in the media. In this day in age, the media has a major impact on society and their perception on PWMI. Sadly, this population comes with a stigma and are seen as violent even when they are. They are viewed as a threat more than they are a normal human being and because of the stigmas associated with having a mental disorder, the NIMBY phenomenon becomes a little more widespread. This topic reminds me of the movie ""When They See Us"" which is the movie about the Central Park 5. I never paid enough attention to the case until it came up in this MLFP program. Even that was not enough to look into it more. Once Netflix covered the story, it changed my life. People need to see the truth being reflected in the media just as they see all of these other horror stories. The stories that are being covered are merely a representation of the availability heuristic. Something that does not occur often, but immediately make us believe that it does. PWMI are not these violent and dangerous criminals that are responsible for every mass shooting that occurs. While they may represent 4% of the violence we see, PWMI should be seen as individuals that are a part of our society who deserve to have their needs met like those in the Ted Talk video were discussed. Those needs represent what everyone could benefit from, ALL human beings alike."
438,"Throughout history mental illness has been viewed in a plethora of ways and sadly the timeline did not begin with the type of acceptance and grace that we see today. From the very beginning of acknowledging PWMI, Pre-Civilization reflected a lack of support that PWMI could take care of themselves by sharing the responsibilities that fell onto the families of PWMI. When I consider the term  self-determination, I break up the phrase and focus on the “self” part. In my opinion, this simply means that PWMI can determine own their own or can show their own determination towards someone or something. Either way, free-will for the self is applicable here, yet it is observed that in Pre-Civilization, family members took on a role of managing PWMI as if having mental illness meant that PWMI could not determine own their own or practice free-will. Did PWMI wake up one day and decide ‘I want trephination!’ or was this decided for them? Was every PWMI in need of trephination? This leads me to the Ancient Civilization era, where Hippocrates shared views on PWMI and identified conditions of PWMI instead of some blanket problem assigned to them all, because not every mental illness was the same, yet during this time PWMI were all being treated the same.   Even if we skip over to the Middle Ages, where Lesson 1-2 mentions mental illness and evil spirits we can learn that “outcasts,” some of which were PWMI, lives were at stake and many were tortured and killed based on other’s beliefs of possible witchcraft or devil spots. Again, I think this suggests a lack of seeing PWMI as a population of people who could practice free-will and were assigned decision-makers as a blanket rule. However, once we advance into The Renaissance and Pre-Civil War, we can see improvements in how PWMI were seen and treated, especially with the development of hospitals and asylums. Even with places like Bethlam Royal Hospital or Eastern Lunatic Asylum being built, PWMI still underwent maltreatment and abuse at the hands of their overseers. Historically, many non-psychiatrists were the decisionmakers for PWMI and this led to misdiagnosis, oppression, maltreatment/abuse and ultimately even death.   In an earlier discussion, I discussed that in the 18th century, some women who did not behave like the typical housewife, but instead practiced masturbation or whose sexual desires deviated from the norm were admitted as mentally ill. To tie this in with the pro"
439,"Great Post Suzanna! Your introductory paragraph was so powerful and full of exciting information. I was reading your passage and actually imagining PWMI being visited like freak show displays at a local fair. I hope that this was never the case, but there is no telling the extremities that this population endured as the outcasts of society. Do you mind sharing the citation information for the information if it was not part of our assigned readings? I would love to read through and see what other stories were shared. It really helps paint a picture of the progress we have made with treating PWMI as human beings. The thought of trephination is scary. I mentioned it in my discussion as well. What are your views on trephination as a practice and what would you say is acceptable or valid about the practice?   We share some of the same views on how PWMI are treated while in institutions and I do believe it is similar to the prison system. When we began Lecture 1-1 we were exposed to a video discussing the death of Timothy Souders. His death, just like many others is a prime example and reflection of the need to improve the level of attention and care PWMI receive as patients or prisoners. You are very right that education is important and the more our society learns, the better chances we have of seeing improvements for hospitals and prison systems for PWMI. Honestly, the level of care should always be high, and it should always be priority. It seems as if sometimes the moment people “see” the mental illness also becomes the moment society stops seeing the person. What would you propose is a solution to the “us vs them” dilemma as a means to achieve full inclusion?"
440,"Great Post Caroline! I love how you started off with highlighting the term “outcasts.” I used the same term throughout a few discussion posts in this class because it really suggests how PWMI were treated historically and honestly how the population continues to be treated. I agree that it is very hard to change people’s belief systems. Beliefs are learned and when emotions are tied to our learning, let’s just say we are sold on what we learn. It becomes golden. Growing up, I was exposed to the movie “Roots” at a very young age. I believed that all White people were evil and my emotions from seeing the gut-wrenching whippings made it hard to forget. Throughout time, I had to learn that time itself has changed and that what I was exposed to was similar to 4% (the real number that reflects violence of PWMI) being blown up to look like the 96% (the rest of violence that is not highlighted). I wish the media would highlight how violent the population of PWMI really is instead of the random chance events that seem like they happen every day (when they really do not).  Concerning mental health, what is your take on those living with mental illness but not officially or clinically diagnosed? Unofficial diagnosis could be due to a lack of access, refusal of care, and/or inadequate care. Some people refuse to seek care in order to avoid being labeled as the next mass shooter or deadly maniac on a rampage. Mental heath is very important and receiving proper care or any type of care is a start to improving the current situation we are in now. Would you agree? If not, why?"
441,"  A president can be effective in bringing about an end to stigma of mental illness in a variety of ways. Using their platform as the leader of the nation is by far one of the most powerful ways possible to reach the attention of the U.S. Nowadays, everything Donald Trump does and says is headlining especially on popular social media platforms. If social media is one of the most influential ways to reach masses of people representing a wide range of demographic factors, then I believe it is a smart and powerful tool to utilize in order to reach the people of the world. Every day, people all over the world like and share videos, pictures, and quotes from various social media platforms. I think using the most popular ones like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat would definitely help reach the population of people who can help bring an end to stigma. Sometimes all it takes is a second to see something that will change the way you look at things forever. This video of President Obama was very moving, and the world deserves to hear more words like this from people of power. It really does make a difference. Sadly, it is not always about what is being said, but WHO is saying it. If you get the right words to come out of a powerful mouth, that just might become a golden moment in history."
442,"From my perspective, I would not say that reducing benefits necessarily impacts the policymaker's views on ""worthiness"" of mental health versus other health. I see mental health as part of health care; however, I feel that the policymaker's views on the ""worthiness""  of who is receiving the benefits is affected. According to the information provided in Lesson 2-2, structural stigma shows that low-income and/or those low on the SES scale tend to be impacted by these benefits, especially if the benefits are at risk of being cut. If this structure is one that tends to be cost-shifting, then people who oppose government funding for low-income would likely see how and why policymakers would want to cut down on how much money is being used on these types of benefits."
443,"Just as the veteran stated in the video, I would highly recommend group therapy as a starter for mental health treatment. If we go back to Lesson 2-3, it was mentioned that troops are reticent to report mental illness do the stigma surrounding the issue. One way to reduce feeling self-conscious about anything is talking about it to other people who may be experiencing the same feelings. Once a person does not feel so alone in the process, taking the next step may not feel so complicated and scary. I would recommend the same for veterans. Veterans may be able to impact the lives of active troops who have yet to experience the type of active duty that veterans have."
444,"If by society, we mean mental health doctors, I would say that society should be allowed to ""step in"" and mandate treatment if it means preventing PWMI from causing harm to themselves or others. In a way, if the person has not yet acknowledge that he/she is ill and poses no risks to themselves or society, than why should anyone mandate treatment upon them? That would seem like an invasion of privacy and rights. I believe that if we begin to allow society to ""step in"" whenever they very well please, that could potentially open up the floodgates to intrusion upon a person's right to refuse treatment. If part of me were to agree, it would only be for the instances when harm to the self or others is at issue."
445,"Given the various forms of stigma related to PWMI, what should teachings/curricula contain to combat stigma? Consider elementary, middle and high schools as potential target groups.   This module has opened my eyes to stigma related to PWMI. Sadly, many people do not assume that the stigma associated with mental illness is a major problem in our society, but this module does a great job shedding light on many of the issues that are overlooked. Teaching and/or adding this type of information to the curriculum could be so beneficial for the students who have been and those who have yet to be exposed to mental illness. At an early age, children can be diagnosed with mental illness, so it is important to find ways of bringing awareness to those diagnosed, who have yet to be diagnosed, and the people who will be in contact with PWMI (young and old). This means introducing the topic as early as elementary school age. Incorporating brief educational courses that are age appropriate is a way to reduce stigmatizing attitudes in the school environment (Rüsch, Angermeyer, & Corrigan, 2005). In order to combat stigma at the elementary school level I would suggest reading books that help early learners grasp the concept of people being mentally different while also teaching inclusion and appropriate social interactions. I would also try to include theatrical plays where students can be exposed to physical modeling of inclusion and appropriate social interactions. For middle school, I would also encourage teaching about the term stigma and how it applies to mental health as a part of a social skills/ life biology course. With an increase in bullying around middle school to high school age, my attention was drawn to a fact mentioned in Lecture 2-4 about PWMI dying at a younger age. Along with that, the textbook pointed out that PWMI are significantly more likely to be the victims of violence and not the other way around (Slate, Vollum, & Johnson, 2013). I would propose that rules and policies be implemented to encourage inclusion and deter hateful acts against people for not only race, sexual orientation, or age, but also include mental illness and/or other health complications. We have a wave in the middle school/ high school population where bringing awareness for inclusion at school is high on the list of priorities and this inclusion is based on race, sexual orientation, and gender identification but not so much for mental health. I think b"
446,"Great Post Clara! I am glad that you mentioned the speech by President Obama because I was moved by it. I beat myself up thinking about the fact that I had missed an opportunity to hear such powerful words be spoken on a topic that really needs the world’s attention. It brings me to my point about how powerful the media is. Just like the media is used to portray misinformation about PWMI, it can also be used the exact same way that President Obama chose to use it. Reaching the masses much easier than it used to be and although I missed my moment to hear the speech when it was originally given; being able to hear it and share it today is what makes such a difference. The power in social media is definitely a way for the school system and other academia to combat stigma for PWMI.   The story about Anne was also moving and, in my discussion, I mentioned that maybe schools could implement these stories by acting them out just like they do in school plays. I have always been more of a visual learner and I believe that sometimes reading about stories is just not enough to get the message across. How do you feel about these types of stories being physically modeled? Do you think it would be offensive to some? While some topics covered in school settings can be quite offensive or even sensitive to some, I believe the motive behind what we are trying to achieve is key. Spreading awareness about this topic and how schools can combat stigma is of the utmost importance. You also mentioned that it should be a required subject taught and I thought that this idea was great. How would you recommend the school system go about implanting this or what exactly would the subject cover?   Again, Great Post!"
447,"Great Post Nani!   I like how you provided various examples of how stigma of PWMI could be combatted in the school setting. You mentioned documentaries, political programs, and local news. These are great ideas and I was wondering would you consider documentaries to be something geared more towards the middle school and high school population? How could a documentary on PWMI and the stigmas associated with it be presented to children at an elementary age because I think it would be an amazing way to learn as younger kids love television. I was wondering if a cartoon depicting real life situations could be used and still be age appropriate information. One of our readings mentioned that mental illness being presented in medical terms (biological) instead of psychosocial leads to harsher behavior towards PWMI (Rüsch, Angermeyer, & Corrigan, 2005). I would hope these types of facts are also included along with the facts about how PWMI are not as dangerous as the media portrays. This information would likely help reduce the bullying behavior because PWMI are also victims of violence as we learned in the text as well as Lecture 2-3. Also, your idea on how to present this topic to the elementary school level was brilliant. It is one thing to learn inside of the classroom, but having the parents involved really helps solidify the importance of the topic and also gets the parents involved as well as informed. Not all households have accurate information on PWMI so having supplemental education in the home could greatly benefit and combat the stigma on PWMI."
448,"The concepts of specificity and sensitivity could apply to decisions about civil commitment in the area where certain court cases may rely on expert testimony to determine how long someone should be committed. Just like the video said, it is a matter of who is conducting the research and the type of question that is being asked. The state may higher an expert whose results may reflect data with higher specificity while the opposing side's data may reflect higher sensitivity. It really depends on the circumstances. In terms of risk to the individual and society, a false positive could potentially benefit the individual in certain cases where an insanity plea could keep them from prison and at the same time harm society as justice would not be served. It could also place the individual in a position to potentially experience longer stays as civil commitment sentences can be much longer than a criminal sentence. It is not as easy to be released seeing as you have to prove to be ready to re-enter life as a civilian. As for a false negative, that could harm the individual by sending them out into the world with a potentially mental health issue that is not seen as problematic. This person may never receive the right kind of help. It is also harmful to society to have a person that they believe is good wandering the streets when in reality experts failed to identify the person as dangerous."
449,"That video was so amazing and heartbreaking at the same time. Involuntary commitment of sex offenders after they complete their sentence is both a good and bad idea. I think it is a good idea because certain ""SVPs"" may need further rehabilitation that a regular prison simply cannot provide. However, it would not be fair to make this decision after the inmate has already served his time. I think that it should be decided at the original trial sentencing whether the defendant will need further rehabilitation after serving the original sentence or if the defendant will be deemed free after paying for his crime by the standards set forth by the criminal justice system. Just like the inmate in the video, who committed a crime as a juvenile, felt robbed of his freedom by the justice system, many others that  look just like him face a similar fate. A non-Black defendant (of the same crime type) would have a better chance at being freed and not being sent to a mental health facility following his initial bid compared to a Black defendant. Lecture 3-2 discussed that civil commitment is viewed as discriminatory due to the fact that Blacks are committed at higher rates than everyone else and further, are more likely to be treated with coercion. A blanket decision for this question just screams injustice (in my opinion) because every SVP is not the same and should not be treated the same."
450,"I consider outpatient commitment to be the larger reach into an individual's liberty by state authority because inmates have already served their time and now they have to continue to adhere to more rules and not necessarily living a free life. Lecture 3-3 mentioned mentioned a few issues that caught my attention. For example, the court holding an individual in contempt of the court for non-compliance and being able to place that person back into prison is brutal as a blanket rule. Now, we may easily assume that someone should receive a penalty for non-compliance because the rule is simply to comply; however, what if non-compliance happened due to unforeseen circumstances that often happen to any random person in every day life? What if the person missed their bus because he/she left work a little later than usual or because the bus broke down? What if this person was involved in a fight and arrested, but was merely defending himself from being assaulted and did not initiate confrontation? Bad things happen to good people all the time and the sad thing is non-compliance could mean a lot of things. To allow the state to have such a stronghold on people's lives while receiving outpatient services, after already having paid their debt to society, is far from being ""free"" and sounds like another form of  prison. Of course, there are those who deserve to be held in contempt, but the problem is binary and either we allow the state to hold authority or we do not. This could also relate to the video from Lesson 3-2 where we see that some people should not have to face commitment after serving their prison sentence; however, the law allows for such discretion to be used, regardless of bad predictions or unforeseen circumstances. How free can someone be if medication is forced or services are anti-therapeutic?"
451," INPATIENT COMMITMENT  (Pros): Supporters are likely to believe that involuntary commitment provides care and treatment for those individuals who require it such as those suffering from sever mental illness and at a heightened risk of imminent serious bodily injury to themselves and/or others. Lesson 3-2 discusses that society is protected from those individuals and further that involuntary civil commitment relieves families from having to provide care for the patient's needs as these types of health costs can be burdensome on patient’s without insurance or government assistance.  (Cons): Critics are likely to complain about involuntary commitment being coercive, anti-therapeutic, discriminatory towards Blacks, stigmatizing, and/or driven by a means of financial profit (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013). For example, our lessons/ textbook repeatedly mention how PWMI are viewed as violent. Further we learn that Blacks tend to receive more severe diagnosis and sadly are more likely to be treated with coercion than others. Clearly, for the individual this may come about as an infringement on their rights; however, society feels safer knowing that individuals (who are known to be a danger to others) are being kept away from the public and receiving rehabilitation instead of wandering the streets without proper medical care.    OUTPATIENT COMMITMENT  (Pros): Supporters of are likely to support that individuals who are in need of medical treatment should receive it under the hands of the State and that this would serve as a benefit to the individual who will be ensured proper treatment/medication and a benefit to society in that these individuals will be less of a harm to the public (Slate et al., 2013). Supporters further contend that the State is merely stepping in under parens patriae to aid the incapacitated and use police power to reduce street crimes by those with a level of ""dangerousness"" that is unsuitable for the community (2013).     (Cons): Critics are likely to complain about the same issues as inpatient commitment (coercion, anti-therapeutic, discriminatory towards Blacks, stigmatization). Outpatient commitment also receives criticisms concerning statutes being unconstitutional and also how tragedy drives policy (Slate et al., 2013). For example, Swan"
452,"Great Post Briana! It seems like we chose a similar way of writing out our ideas to the question prompt. I felt it was a great way to separate my thoughts and clearly communicate the pros and cons of inpatient versus outpatient commitment. My pros and cons for inpatient commitment were very similar to yours as well as for outpatient commitment; however, you mentioned something different and very interesting as a pro for outpatient commitment. Are you saying that studies show depression in homeless individuals who received outpatient care? If so, where can I find more information on that? It sounds more like a con, but a great argument nonetheless for critics who oppose outpatient commitment. I agree that these individuals should be evaluated every step of the way. Sadly, as we learned in Lesson 3-1 that predictions based off these evaluations can be inaccurate and thus lead to some of the issues that we’ve learned this module on being committed and having a hard time being released (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013). How do you think clinicians can improve their predictions as a means to reduce error?"
453,"Great Post Liisa! You mentioned some great ways of measuring success as well as services to help PWMI transition from inmates to patients/civilians. You kept your post straight to the point and simple, which made it very easy to compare and contrast our views. I, too, mentioned individuals taking their medications and society feeling protected by such requirements. I also discussed coercion as a con for both inpatient and outpatient commitment. It was a very sad yet amazing read on the discriminatory views for outpatient commitment and how some perceive these as racial disparities against Blacks and moreover Black men. Swanson and colleagues (2009) did a great job on explaining another way of seeing the disproportionate reflection of Blacks being committed to outpatient care by explaining that the situation could also be due to the over-representation of Blacks in that given population in New York. What was your opinion more towards disparity or the alternative? Also, how do you feel about tragedy-driven policies? The video discussing inmates being subject to extra rehabilitation after finishing their sentences made me think that random heinous tragedies drive policies that make it harder for inmates to be released as civilians when they are predicted to be more dangerous than they actually are. The system could really use some help and I am sure social scientist are working diligently to help policymakers better understand how to successfully evaluate inmates, so as to reduce the number of individuals faced with prolonged rehabilitation due to inaccurate clinical predictions."
454,"Good Morning, I have not used zoom to record. Just a trial video call with the class during orientation."
455,"The adjudication process would seem the most difficult for PWMI to navigate due to the level of judicial understanding that takes place at this stage. In the adjudication process, a criminal would likely have an arraignment where the criminal would have to enter a plea for the charges against him/her. Now this may not be the case for all PWMI, but being competent to stand trial and/or understanding the rights being held against the criminal is key to the adjudication process running smoothly. If the criminal is (let's say) a PWMI diagnosed with schizophrenia who suffers from delusions and hears voices, how can the judge allow the person to enter a guilty plea if he/she claims the voices told them to do it or face imminent death? This is just an example; but, the point I am trying to make is that some PWMI may not fully appreciate the nature of the crime and/or may not be able to understand the charges enough to stand trial, let alone enter a plea. These issues may make it difficult to navigate the adjudication process."
456,"With the recent changes in California corrections having to shift responsibility for large numbers of felons from state prisons to local jails, PWMI might face challenges like those mentioned in the video from Lesson 4-2 (i.e., budget cuts affecting the supplies necessary to house PWMI; lack of appropriate and trained staff who are equipped to handle those inmates). The ultimate challenge for PWMI is not having their needs met due to an issue that is out of their hands. This shift could also be beneficial in that PWMI would receive shorter sentences (under a year) and have certain charges reduced on their records which can ultimately help them transition from inmate life to life as a law abiding/working civilian."
457,"I do not necessarily think it is ""fair"" that police often serve as first responders to situations involving PWMI; however, it is an officers job to protect and serve even if it means responding to calls that may lead to interactions with PWMI. It is not the case that officers always know who they are being called to deal with. How are officers to know whether the situation they are being called to respond to involve a person suffering from schizophrenia or extreme delusions? In a dream world, it would be amazing to have those trained in the field of mental health to be the first responders, but that would cost more money than the state is willing to provide. What is being provided to protect the community during crisis situations are the police, and while they are not always trained to deal with PWMI, it is only right that they respond to ALL emergency situations given the training (in crisis intervention) they received in order to protect and serve."
458,"CIT and stigma are related due to the fact that people suffering from mental illness are stigmatized and law enforcement officers are not immune to believing many of the stigmas associated with mental illness. For example, we have learned throughout this course that PWMI are seen as dangerous individuals and while this is not the case, some untrained officers are more likely to perceive a person with mental illness as a threat (rather than nonthreatening) and the end result could potentially be fatal for the person with mental illness as well as the officer. The training associated with CIT helps to inform and educate the officers in training about stigma associated with people who suffer from mental illness and thus is more likely to reduce the stigmatizing attitudes towards PWMI."
459,"According to this week’s lecture, Crisis Intervention Teams originated in Memphis is among one of the most popular around as a diversion pre-booking program that focuses on providing law enforcement with information and de-escalation techniques to for increased positive interactions with PWMI (Taheri, 2016). Concerning its overall effectiveness, some critics posit that it appears to be a blind novelty in that there is no significant evidence on its effectiveness (2016). On the topic of CITs and arrest, research showed that CIT trained officers were less likely to arrest PWMI when compared to those that were not CIT trained, and further the Georgia study mentioned reflected similar findings. Also, when use of force was in question, results showed significantly positive effects on the outcomes with CIT training (2016). One of the downsides was that in self-reporting measures, that officers could report more favorable outcomes than what might actually be the case as shown in official documentation (2016). As far as the continued use of CIT training, I would require it across all police departments to ensure that police officers are at the very least receiving some form of education and training on PWMI and possible interactions with them. I would suggest relying on official documentation as well as self-reports to gain better accuracy for generalizing whether this program is truly effective. In an article that assessed police officer perceptions on the impact of CIT programs, Bonefine and colleagues reported that some officers have over seven encounters a month with PWMI (Bonefine, Ritter, & Munetz, 2014). Further, Ellis’s (2014) article on CIT programs before and after showed that not only does the training improves knowledge, but perceptions and attitudes as well which helps to reduce the problems associated with police use of force when dealing with PWMI and the stigma that they are dangerous (2014). This ultimately increases and improves communication, which as we learned from the lecture videos is of great importance along with empathy.   Bonfine, N., Ritter, C., & Munetz, M. (2014). Police officer perceptions of the impact of Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) programs.

Effects of a Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) Training Program Upon Police Officers Before and After Crisis Interventio"
460,"Great Post McKenna! I completely agree with you. It seems like a major concern would be funding this training for officers, but in my opinion it would really be at the expense of better interactions versus fetal outcomes. Of course the program is not perfect, but there are many studies that support the program and its benefits to both the police force and PWMI. Bonefire, Ritter, and Munetz (2014) did a study on the police officers and their perceptions of the CIT program and what they found was that the positive attitudes of the officers were associated with their confidence in dealing with crisis management with PWMI as well as overall department effectiveness. These officers truly believe that this program will benefit the way they do their job and will enhance the overall productiveness of their department. Do you think that crisis intervention programs that do not highlight PWMI reflects  generalization or would the inclusion of mental health background be more realistic? I would agree with the latter and I think that is what most of this research is trying to show. We would more likely be better of with CIT programs than without it. I noticed that you included the information on 1 in 10 calls being related to PWMI. I wanted to share with you that Bonefire et al (2014) also reported that officers claimed having (on average) over seven encounters with PWMI on a monthly basis. Clearly, there are many run ins with PWMI and the best way to deal with these encounters are to be proactive and I think that it was these programs are aiming for.

461,"Great Post Danielle! I truly thank you for your summary of the article as you pointed out some key findings and relayed it in a more understandable way. Sometimes the methodology and results section can contain overwhelming statistical jargon that bores the ears. Your summary actually made it sound interesting. I agree with you about the training actually helping the officers to be better prepared to deal with these issues before they ever arise. CIT is a proactive training and with the number of reports showing interactions with PWMI, this would likely be a way to help better prepare these officers. What do you think can be done as far as conducting more studies that can generalize these results to be more representative? To do away with the program would not necessarily bring any harm, but having these types of programs available helps to reduce harm. H.A Ellis (2014) performed a study on the effects of CIT on police officers and compared the knowledge, attitudes, perceptions and impact on police practice that CIT training had on the officers before and after the training. What they found was that the trainings (subjectively and objectively) are effective to the extent that it provides a better standard of care (2014). Is that not what we are seeking here? I think the entire world could benefit from a better standard of care between police interactions with PWMI and people representing other special populations as well."
462,"According to the video, it seems like the norm for a person with mental illness to be arrested and jailed more than 100 times. Those with this high of a number are being arrested for crimes associated with theft. It was stated that the majority of the time these retail thefts are merely a quest for food as a means to feed themselves. It was also stated that PWMI arrested numerous times are being held for charges such as criminal trespass to land. For the homeless population of PWMI, criminal trespass to land is another way to say that these people were likely found squatting or sleeping in an unauthorized place. It must be easy for this population to be arrested and according to the video, easier to be released after a few days, weeks, or even months. The jails have turned into what is referred to as an insane asylum for inmates with PWMI."
463,"THREE KEY INDICATORS concerning mental illness, I feel like jails should measure recidivism rates, hospitalization rate, and suicide/suicide attempt rates. Recidivism rates can be a strong indicator of patients and offenders who are receiving proper and adequate health treatment. For example, PWMI may be less likely to re-offend if they are receiving proper medication and more likely to engage in criminal behavior when not taking their medication. Hospitalization rates (duration of stay, pharmaceutical records, re-admissions) can be a good indicator of safety and quality of care being received by offenders with mental illness. For example, a 'history of Patient X's record that show he has been hospitalized 10 times in the past year before being arrested and prescribed anti-psychotic medication each time is indicative of a mental health problem that is unresolved and needs attention. Suicide and suicide attempt rates are strong indicators of offenders who are likely to be a danger to themselves or possibly others and might be a help preventative measure. Those are just to name a few."
464,"I think jail inmates are given a fairly decent amount of rights. I will not say that they are given too many, because inmates are still human beings; however, I will say that inmates should not have all the freedoms that civilians have because they have broken some form of the law and/or violated rights. I do not believe that rights should be taken away per se, but there needs to be some action taken to deter law breaking. If prisoners and jail inmates experienced incarceration without limitations on their rights, the justice system is likely to take many hits and a few lawsuits as well. What if a prisoner did not have to be checked for weapons or confined after fatally wounding another inmate or a guard? If there is a way to incarcerate these jail inmates without taking away rights, I would love to hear about some ideas. This topic is very interesting!"
465,"I think medication is the most common form of treatment for persons with mental illness because generally you get symptoms alleviated much faster or rather the effects of the drugs improve symptoms much faster than other methods such as therapy (which also costs). If these people can pose a danger to themselves or others, than the fastest and most efficient method should be weighed against the most recommended by doctors in order to preserve the safety and well-being of the patient and others in direct contact with the patient."
466,"There are some PWMI who commit crimes that are sent to jails or prisons and then there are those with mental illness that are sent to serve time in a mental hospital. There are also PWMI who are sent to jail/prison and once they finish serving their time, are sent to a mental hospital to serve even more time. Sometimes placement of those with serious mental illness in jails is inappropriate given the funding, architectural, and operational constraints. We began to see a major shift of PWMI and serious mental illness being sent to jails instead of mental hospitals during the public safety realignment phases. These policy changes went into effect in hopes to reduce prison populations and the problems associated with overcrowding.    Funding, Architectural, and Operational Constraints  During the handoff from state to local county jails, funding became a major concern because there was not enough money being funded to the counties to aid in supervision and maintenance of the offenders coming in from the state prisons. Prop 47 was a policy change that was aimed at reducing prison population and the savings that were to result from lowing prison population was to be redirected to mental health services (Lofstrom, Bird, & Martin, 2016). However, this change also brought about the need for medical and mental health beds. According to the video we watched in Wk4Lec4-2, a problem that jails experienced was overcrowding and insufficient staffing, beds, and supplies to house the serious mental ill. If this population is not receiving adequate care, then the use of jails given these funding restraints is inappropriate for the serious mentally ill. What would be appropriate is ensuring that an adequate mental health budget is being allotted for the local county jails to house the number of inmates with serious mental illness and not just a budget to house a jail facility that’s almost at capacity. PWMI sometimes get the short end of the stick with policies like Prop 47. For example, some people with serious mental illness may benefit from treatment that is provided in jails, however; petty crimes mostly associated with serious mental illness are considered non-serious and thus leaves PWMI on the street and likely fare worse than before the shift (Raphael & Stoll, 2013). These policies affect funding, which affect how much space and housing a jail can provide, as well as daily operation with supervision, medical"
467,"Great Post Steve! Those statistics that you mention right in your introduction are sad, yet captivating. I also mentioned in my post about being underfunded and understaffed. How on earth can an institution house people with serious mental illness if they are not economically equipped to cater to this population. The news clip video that we watched last week on Orange County Jail, spoke volumes because it did not just represent what is going on here (locally), but a problem that may be affecting many other counties. In short, I agree that it is clear on where PWMI who have committed crimes belong and it is not a jail. The population in jail may be very different than what a person with serious mental illness can endure as far as safety is concerned. Are there protections in place for inmates with SMI that are being housed with inmates with serious priors like murder and armed robbery? If an average criminal is not usually housed in a mental hospital, than why put someone who should be in a mental institution in a jail? It is inappropriate and unfair to PWMI."
468,"Great Post Janee! We discussed some of the same topic and I agree that jail is no place for PWMI especially those with serious mental illness. It is hard to understand that this population is in need of treatment, yet they receive less than adequate care. While this may seem unfair, it only reflects the capabilities of the county jails given their restrictive budget. I am glad you highlighted the part of the video on Orange County Jail that showed part of the facility being shut down due to budget cuts. Not only can they not allow more inmates to come in, but they cannot afford staffing to cover that wing of the jail. Ironically enough, some criminals actually commit crimes just to receive housing, food, and medical care; however, with these types of policies being put into place, some people with serious mental illness will not make it into jail and thus receive no treatment or temporary shelter which leaves them worse off than their current situation. What would you suggest the counties do to aid PWMI and help them receive medication and temporary housing so they do not have to resort to crime as a solution?"
469,"I think that it is fair to use risk assessment tools when they are not 100% accurate; however, I do not think that it is fair to make determinations and decisions based solely on the risk assessment tools alone. Risk assessments tools (while not always accurate) are valid and produce results that measure what is intended to be measured. Sometimes these risk assessment tools can be biased. For example, some risk assessment tools consider prior arrest records. We know that in the United States, minorities, and especially Black men, are disproportionately overrepresented in the prison system and further have higher arrest rates than any other race. This could negatively impact scores and provide valid results with inaccurate representations that are not very good as far as generalization."
470,"I do not think that mental health professionals would be as receptive to the RNR approach for PWMI as they are for people without mental illness. This is because the prison systems were not specifically designed for PWMI and thus the focus areas of certain factors (i.e., anti-social friends, behaviors, substance abuse) may reflect biases as PWMI deal with antisocial behavior and substance abuse much differently than people without mental illness. Recidivism is only one of the many factors that are considered and people must think beyond the norm if they are to consider factors for PWMI. The classification systems should be different as the underlying principles of the RNR tend to focus on high-risk offenders; however, PWMI are not as likely to be arrested for violent crimes and thus are less likely to be labeled high-risk. Further, Lecture 6-1 stated that focusing on low-risk offenders with intensive treatment could actually be counterproductive—leading to worse outcomes. When dealing with PWMI, other criminogenic factors like work performance, recreational activities, and antisocial cognition should also be considered as these may look different when compared to people without mental illness."
471,"I do not actually think probation is exclusively set up to address supervision and treatment of PWMI; however, I do think that the video highlights the fact that a probation officer's job is to facilitate behavior change in order to see a reduction in recidivism and thus they are expected to match the offender to the services they need to be able to hold them accountable. The problem I have with this is that the chief did not mention that his officers are required to match the offender to the services they need. This would be especially important for PWMI because if this population relies on medical treatment services, than the officer would need to ensure that receiving these services would be a part of the accountability and conditions to be met in order to avoid being in violation. I do think that probation for PWMI is a better way to provide rehabilitation compared to jail. Jail is simply no place for PWMI especially when their medical needs are not being adequately met."
472,"I am unsure how I would feel as a participant in the mental health court. On the one hand, it seems like being referred to mental health court leads to better outcomes for the patients as they transition back into the community. On the other hand, this process seems less formal as far as the adversarial process is concerned and thus diminishes the importance of federal rights. I would not necessarily say that I would prefer traditional court processing because both systems have its fair share of flaws; however, it would seem most beneficial to utilize mental health courts over traditional when there is a significant amount of jail/prison time being considered. Considering what we know about the prison/jail systems, PWMI are less likely to benefit from serving a long time in jail/prison and are more likely to benefit from the therapeutic jurisprudence and treatment-focused programs that are associated with mental health courts."
473,"The Risk Needs Responsivity Model does hold a widespread acceptance in that it is empirically valid and serves as a practical tool. However, this is exactly why Skeem et al, (2015) cautioned the RNR stating that there is a remarkable absence of empirical studies in support of the notion that the RNR model will improve the ability to reach the goals it claims to reach concerning persons with mental illness and the justice system. With this is mind, I would likely inform the Chief Probation Officer that because there is a need for more research to show a generalizable effectiveness with the special population of PWMI, that I would proceed with caution on the use of the RNR Model and focus on ways to directly influence PWMI on probation without reliance on the model. Skeem and Louden (2006) estimate that roughly 15% of those on probation/parole have a mental illness. In my opinion, the first step would be to ensure that all probation officers are being mandated to receive special training/education on PWMI. Training and education can can aid in the gray areas such as overgeneralized risk factors that ignore either high/low risk or general offenders versus PWMI (Skeem et al., 2015).   Lecture 6-3 repeatedly stated that probation officers can be key in community supervision. To strengthen this, Slate and colleagues (2013) advised that at least 40 hours of training should be completed to allow probation officers to effectively treatment and supervision to every person with mental illness on their caseloads. I would also suggest the use of specialty programs for both low and high risk (caseload) as they provide extensive training for having PWMI as cases and also help them gain access to benefits and services necessary to thrive as community members. In Module 6-3, the video Change Behavior, Reduce Crime, the Chief Probation Officer stated that probation was the more appropriate sanction compared to jail/prison due to the fact that prison per se does not necessarily change behavior and thus finding a population to effectively manage in the community starts with highlighting the differences between general offenders and offenders with mental illness in order to effectuate a widely-used model like RNR without having to proceed with caution.   Skeem, J., & Louden, J. (2006). Toward evidence-based practice for probationers and parolees mandated to mental health treatment.  Psychiatric Services (Washington, D.C.),  57<"
474,"Great Post Wendy! I similarly advised the same ideology in that evidenced-based support is crucial and of course lacking. Skeem and colleagues did a great job highlighting the weaknesses in RNR and I think that by bringing such limitations towards the light, research will benefit in this area. Skeem et al. (2015) caught my attention when the article mentioned that the CBT programs tend to achieve some of the largest and most consistent effect sizes concerning the reduction of recidivism rates. If we are to compete with the widely accepted and used RNR model, then an equally strong target is worth mentioning. You also mentioned public health and safety concerns as it was discussed in the article and you are very right that PWMI are more likely to be able to care for themselves if they are in better health. Better health is likely to lead to less episodes and better choices as community members which should aid in the area of recidivism. Probation officers need to be educated in this arena to be able to provide access and accommodations to offenders with mental illness transitioning back into the community. What role do you think probation officers play in ensuring CBT is accessible for all caseloads being managed? What about if probation officers are unaware of CBT?"
475,"Great Post Briana!   You did a great job highlighting some of the risk factors associated with PWMI. I agree that treatment should not focus solely on the symptoms and that other risk factors should be considered; however, as Skeem et al. (2015) also pointed out, the risk principle is more focused on increasing public safety and not really on improving health and overall welfare of those with PWMI. I believe this was just another reason why the CBT model was worth mentioning. Would you agree that maybe a combination would be more of a benefit than one program on its own? Of course, the RNR model has drawbacks just as the CBT model is not entirely perfect. To produce results that are both evidence-based and empirically valid/reliable, I would suggest providing training and education on how to use a combination to offset the weakness of just using one method. Do you feel that the RNR model should be cautioned to probation officers who are only relying on risks of recidivism that overgeneralize without representing a special population like PWMI? From the video, it seems as if chief probation officers are aware that probation per se is the preferred choice in the monitoring of transitioning offenders and the reduction of law-breaking behaviors. The question is how generalizable are the results (chief probation officers rely on) concerning recidivism risks when they are solely based on the RNR model that focuses on general offenders, yet tends to lack in the arena of specialty groups like PWMI?"
476,"That was a very sad ending to that video.  Looking at the prison environment, I think PWMI could have their conditions aggravated because certain symptoms can be triggered simply by being in the presence of the wrong person/people or an episode being brought on by a situation that no guards can understand due to lack of training. Adams and Ferrandino (2008) published an article on mentally ill inmates in prisons, and one thing they mentioned was how this population can have greater difficulties socializing with prison inmates and thus the deficit likely leads to harmful situations like victimization or simply acting out. Just like the video says, law enforcement and their facilities are not generally meant to cater to those with severe mental illness. While it is nice that Doctor Jones started a transition program inside her facility, this is a unique situation that does not generalize to what services all other jails/prisons may have available."
477,"I think it is possible to rehabilitate prisoners with mental illness; however, I think true rehabilitation occurs outside of prison while under the care of a psychological/medical professional. The video mentioned that sometimes intake can be performed by those with doctoral degrees in the field and also by those with lesser degrees such as master level professionals. It was also mentioned in the video that prison may actually exacerbate the symptoms and thus lead the guards to misinterpret the behaviors of inmates with mental illness. Prison in and of itself is not necessarily based around how it can help every inmate be a better person for society. Punishment is a major part of what prisons do as well as deterrence and retribution. How can true rehabilitation be achieved across persons with mental illness if they are punished for being diagnosed as mentally different. I was also taken aback by the comment discussing how prison can actually bring along mental health problems that were not initially there."
478,"I believe that when used as immediate punishment, the benefits for solitary confinement for maintaining prison order outweigh the disadvantages for the inmate if and only if the use of solitary confinement is not excessive in length/duration of stay. In other words, the use of solitary confinement overrides the disadvantages for the inmate when it is used in such a way as to not lead to causes of mental and/or physical health. The video described what symptoms people may begin to experience after sitting in solitary confinement too long. Sadly, those symptoms followed them after being released from solitary confinement and thus did more harm than good to the mental health of the inmate. The inmate's mental and physical well-being should always outweigh the need to punish (excessively). Adams and Ferrandino (2008) published an article on the management of mentally ill inmates and stated that solitary confinement for inmates with mental illness has deleterious effects and causes more pronounced health problems for PWMI."
479,"I feel that tax dollars should not only be spent on housing prisoners with SMI but as stated in he video, should be spent on evidence-based treatments that work. More money would ultimately be used to house prisoners with SMI during their entire sentence versus paying for treatment known to minimize occurrence of symptoms and the need to rely on future treatments. Is hiring more staff and revamping the facility more important than the treatment of prisoners with SMI? The tax dollars should be spent in areas that directly benefit the prisoners with SMI and not so much on indirect benefits like revamping the facility or hiring more prison guards."
480,"This question seems like a lot to swallow especially when you are trying to figure out a single answer that benefits all; however, I do not believe that just one solution will be the “cure all” answer to this question. For starters, I believe that in order to keep inmates and staff safe, the prison guard to prisoner ratio should never be compromised. By this, I mean that guards should never be forced to take on more than they can dish out. Prisons become flooded with one too many prisoners and are forced into budget cuts that do not allow for the hiring of more prison staff or materials necessary to adequately house prisoners. A way to keep inmates and staff safe is provide a rehabilitative environment with enough support staff to ensure that prisoners basic physical and psychological needs are being met. This will likely reduce the risk of staff members being seen as a threat and moreover a guard just doing his or her job. Prisons can provide the needed treatment for PWMI by ensuring a balance between treatment and control (Adams & Ferradino, 2008). The article describes this balance as using professional judgments and evaluations by clinicians and prison administrators concerning treatment effectiveness and risks (2008). However, issues arise when trying to achieve that balance when financial concerns are also on the table. Not only is it expensive to house prisoners, but it is even more expensive to house those with mental illness. My opinion would be to send all prisoners with severe mental illness to a mental hospital, and use the financial resources allocated for mental health prisoners on PWMI. This way, those who need treatment for SMI will not be faced with less than adequate care and the cost to treat mental illness in prison will not be as high considering it will not be used for SMI, but only prisoners with mental illness. Lecture video 7-4 revealed that prisoners with mental illness require attention after being screened which can include medication to curb symptoms and possibly therapeutic treatments. Baillargeon and colleagues (2009) published an article that mentioned recidivism amongst those with mental illness and what the article discussed was a shortage of rehabilitative programs for PWMI as a contributing factor for recidivism. With that said, I do believe that PWMI should receive more resources than other inmates that are not suffering from mental illness. It is bad enough for PWMI to be housed in prison and not mental"
481,"Great Post Jennifer! I like how you jumped straight to the point and stated that keeping people out of prison is the first way to cut costs especially concerning those that do not belong in prison. We have watched a few videos and even a few articles have mentioned the rates of PWMI being incarcerated. I was mostly blown away by those incarcerated for petty arrests or those associated with a homeless lifestyle (trespassing, robbery, theft etc.). Those arrested for these types of charges should be referred to mental institutions and not incarcerated. Medication is the easy solution, so it is more likely that prisons opt to use drugs as a means for fast and convenient results. We know that mental institutions provide therapeutic outlets  well as medication, because health professionals use evidence-based research and not just quick-fix solutions. Adams and Ferradino (2008) discuss constrains and inadequate resources being a major problem for PWMI.  What would you suggest prisons do to cut costs and also provide therapeutic resources to inmates suffering from mental illness?"
482,"Great Post Georgette! Your post was very informative. I like how you included research supporting the issues concerning PWMI receiving higher rates of infractions compared to other inmates without mental illness. If we are to expect an environment where inmates and staff are safe, it should begin with fixing such disproportionate numbers and training officers and staff to treat all inmates the same and not targeting those suffering with mental illness. Adams and Ferrandino (2008) covered environments as therapy in their article and one thing that stood out to me was the discussion of inmates being able to take advantage of the opportunity to use specialized environments to reduce their levels of stress/ detrimental experiences and thus reduce safety risks for both inmates and staff. Honestly, if prisons were equipped to deal with this population, I believe that PWMI would not endure suffering; however, prison staff are not trained and there is not enough money being funded and thus these prisons are left providing the level of care that the prison system can afford and sadly, it is at the expense of the prisoners with mental illness. "
483,"If I were a tax payer, I would feel very positive an hopeful about the construction of the new Fulton State Hospital. They are tearing down an old psychiatric ward that was completely outdated. Its mission does not compare to what the new facility aims to bring to mental health patients. I would rather see tax dollars spent on mental hospitals that will utilize current research to provide services to PWMI than to support prison systems that are not fully equipped to deal with this population."
484,"I would not consider the NGRI a ""get out of jail free card"" per se because a defendant does not actually get to escape punishment. Technically, the defendant will avoid going to prison, but ultimately the judge will have the defendant sent to serve time in a mental hospital where he/she likely will remain for a time amounting to a maximum sentence for that crime. In other words, a criminal has a better chance of receiving less time in a prison than a mental hospital because the judge would give him whatever sentence is suitable for that particular crime, which does not have to be the maximum sentence. For a mental hospital, the defendant is more likely to stay locked up for whatever the maximum sentence is, and thus is not as beneficial as a get out of jail free card. It is more like a ""escape harsh prison and stay mentally institutionalized for a very long time"" card."
485,"State hospitals can best deal with patent and staff safety (while providing treatment) by having a friendly and safe environment with highly trained staff who do not just receive basic training, but have also received education in the area of mental or behavioral health. I would set a standard that staff can only be employed with a certain level of a degree pertaining to mental health. It is sad to see facilities resorting to options that entail less than qualified staff members like kitchen staff being substituted for a mental health employee. Safety for both will require adequate staffing with a back up plan that does not include unqualified candidates filling in."
486,"I feel like it is an acceptable procedure so long as patients are willing and accept the risks associated with the surgery. The results (so far) show hope for the future of depression; however,  I am a bit skeptical for the patients mental capacity to truly appreciate the nature of the surgery and accept such a surgery under the mental health condition of depression and any other associated co-occurring conditions. This is research, so I am excited to see where this will go."
487,"The most appropriate role for state hospitals regarding the criminal justice system is to provide the best care possible for patients regardless of their criminal history. Sometimes it seems as if the punishment aspect is more of the focal point for inmates with mental illness. When this happens, it is more likely that prison will seem more suitable than a mental hospital; however, it is known and has been mentioned multiple times throughout this course that prison is not the best place for PWMI to receive treatment. This is not to say that all inmates should go without punishment for their crimes. The main takeaway is to provide rehabilitation and for criminals suffering from mental illness, thy are likely to fare better in a state hospital. Of course, there are many arguments that state hospitals are outdated and not beneficial to treatment; however, we discovered that Worcester Recovery Center and Hospital was recently built and stands as what the US believes state hospitals should be like. Sisti and colleagues (2015) published an article on the improvement of psychiatric care and what stood out to me was how the article concluded by stating that more facilities like Worcester are needed in order to provide the type of care that is needed by mental health patients. State hospitals should not be used almost exclusively for forensic patients but should contain a wing for forensic patients that may pose a danger to others. If state hospitals were used exclusively for forensic patients, then it would be more like prison. This could be conducive to treatment as well as costly for the state. Again, I am not saying that all criminals that suffer from mental illness should not receive punishment, but how is this population supposed to receive treatment during their rehabilitation if they are being punished? I think with this population, we should take one step at a time and the priority should be to focus on treatment of the mental illness. I also think that there should be a divide between patients with severe mental illness (SMI) and seriously violent prisoners with SMI. For example, Sisti et al (2015) mentioned that when patients are too dangerous and unstable for community-based treatment, the options for this populations are “prison–homelessness–acute hospitalization–prison cycle or long-term psychiatric institutionalization.” Forensic patients should not be cycling through ERs, prisons, and then back to the streets (2015). A state hospital shou"
488,"Great Post Nani! I like how you discussed the aspect of the state intervening for he restoration of competency as well as providing housing for those deemed not guilty by reason of insanity. My belief is that  the state hospital should focus on treating he mental illness first and the criminal second. Regardless of criminal history, if a person has been found to suffer from mental illness, they should receive proper care and that should be provided in a state hospital and not a prison. We both can agree that state hospitals should not exclusively house forensic patients and I feel that are reasoning is similar in that treatment would not be as beneficial. I agree that it should be used for forensic patients and those in need of 24-hr care. Would you say that state hospitals should be exclusively for forensic patients and those with SMI? Do you believe that safety would be compromised housing criminals with non-offenders?"
489,"Great Post Asia! I enjoyed reading your post. You made some really great points on the negative and positive viewpoints concerning forensic patients being housed in state hospitals. The negative viewpoint mentioned how much patients would lack beneficial treatment due to the prison-like environment. This is understandable, but do you believe that a negative could also be forensic patients only being housed with other forensic patients? If we must consider benefits, would you agree that environment plays a role in which patients could potentially benefit from a facility that is not meant to house criminals exclusively? When we look at Hospitals such as Worcester, we see a facility where patients can thrive and are not limited by their criminal history. What is the difference between a state hospital that houses criminals exclusively and a prison ward for those with mental illness?"
490,"The described forms of data sharing seem satisfactory; however, in terms of really understanding the link between the criminal justice system and mental health, I do not feel like the data sharing is satisfactory. I understand that preserving confidentiality should be of the utmost concern for the patients, but I also believe that data sharing should not stand in the way of a patient being identified as in need of services and receiving needed care. There should be protocol and procedures implemented that allow for the protected use of data sharing between the criminal justice system and mental health professionals involved in the criminal justice system like psychiatrist and clinical psychologists."
491,"Honestly, the CIT trained approach looks much different from a routine law enforcement encounter. Specifically, I would compare this encounter to the routine encounter that I wrote my paper on where officers were called to check on someone who they knew was experiencing a mental crisis. The officers arrived with hands on weapons and not appealing to the individual's emotional state. This video showed officers using verbal strategies to deescalate the situation and really talk to the individual and not placing demands. Routine checks show officers placings demands in an unfriendly tone. The incident I was referring to resulted in the death of the mentally ill individual the police were called to encounter. It seems as if the verbal tactics of talking and empathizing really help to gain the person's trust and to help them to understand that police officers come in peace and merely want to help (if and when possible)."
492,"I believe these measures are taken in order to avoid major civil suits. There have been way too many deaths and injuries due to lack of sufficient training and unskilled officers coming into contact with persons with mental illness and reacting based on self-knowledge and stigmas associated with PWMI and not based on education and trainings. I mentioned in the Lecture 9-2 that the incident I wrote my paper on ended with the mentally ill individual being shot. There is an ongoing law suit, where the family will be pointing out mistakes on behalf of the officers. If these officers are found to be at fault for the young man's death, I am sure the department of corrections will make some changes in the way their officers are trained to handle calls for PWMI. As discussed in Lecture 9-3, the department of corrections need to provide training to assist officers/ staff in recognizing cultural factors that may influence their awareness of signs and symptoms of mental illness as well as help improve the ability of corrections officers to communicate with PWMI about procedures and rules."
493,I think mental health workers might have to deal with challenging themselves in finding the best type of practice for mental health care as a team. I think cross-training can help others gain the opportunity to be more confident in their ability to provide the best services possible to help. The video mentioned personal growth in interpersonal skills and being able to show others how to have a shared point of view and not just a subjective and narrow way of handling situations and dilemmas. Cross-training helps agencies/staff to work in a disciplined and focused way while on a team and grow profesionally.
494,"Throughout this course we have discussed the CIT model and according to a large majority of research, it seems like it would be the most suitable training offered for mental health and criminal justice actors to benefit PWMI. CIT, although not an evidenced-based is still widely used and known as the “Best Practice” model for law enforcement to experience training (Watson & Fulambarker, 2013). If we are concerned with PWMI benefiting from interactions with criminal justice actors, then research has shown that CIT-trained officers were less likely to arrest individuals with mental illness (Taheri, 2016). For example, CIT-trained officers transported the mentally ill to more community-based services rather than arrest them compared with their non-CIT counterparts (2016). While we may complain that the number of required hours (40) is low or not enough to be consider effective training, crisis intervention teams focus on deescalating the situation through verbal compromise, empathizing with the individual in crisis, and using physical means as a last resort in order to lower risk of bodily harm or death to the officers involved and the individual in crisis. Parker (2009) published an article on mental health training of officers using National Alliance on Mental Illness-Indiana (NAMI) and what he found was that even under the provision of 10 hours of mental health training, there was a significant decline in use of force and battery by bodily waste. Watson & Fulambarker, (2013) described the CIT model’s primary goals as seeking to increase safety in encounters and when appropriate, divert persons with mental illnesses from the criminal justice system to mental health treatment. In this course, we have learned that health care professionals, psychiatrists/clinicians, and even the chief operating executives at prisons do not believe that jails and prisons are suitable for PWMI. Many of us in this course, have voiced opinions that PWMI seem to get inadequate care due to being forced into a prison system that is not equipped to deal with prisoners suffering from mental illness. If we take a step back, CIT may help train officers to direct PWMI to community-based treatment before resorting to prison. Watson and Fulambarker (2013) explicitly state that CIT is arguably the most well-known model of collaboration to improve police response to mental health crisis. Because it is widely used and well-known, I believe it has a better shot than most and"
495,"Great Post Wendy! You went into great detail on the types of training that could benefit officers in dealing with PWMI. I completely agree that we need a system that would focus on health and safety. Unfortunately, many officers that have not received education and training on crisis management for PWMI are more likely than those that are trained to perceive a crisis with PWMI as dangerous even if the individual is not showing signs of threatening behaviors. CBT focused training and CIT training are both educational and provide hope for departments looking to expand their training to include a focus on crisis intervention as a means to reduce problems concerning untrained officers interacting with PWMI and law suits where the main arguments is that the officer should have resorted to a non-physical means of intervention before utilizing deadly force. With deinstitutionalization,  officers should be aware of the best options for PWMI and it is community-based treatment or hospitalization and not prison or death from an officer-involved shooting."
496,"Great Post Briana! I enjoyed reading your post and the part about the utilization of 5150 holds. This made me think of Miles Hall, who was 23 years old and lost his life during a routine police encounter. Miles suffered from mental illness and was experiencing an episode. The police called to the scene were informed that they were dealing with a mental health crisis, but when they arrived on the scene, you could not observe the same CIT tactics that we viewed this week in lecture videos or the methods discussed in readings. I understand that officers need to protect themselves, but when it comes to 5150 calls, should there not be a procedure in place that keeps police officers from responding with the use of deadly force? I am not saying that officers should not be allowed to protect themselves from harm, but if the threat of harm is not imminent, are there not procedures in place to prevent deaths from occurring during these routine calls? Sadly, the officers called to the scene were CIT trained, so it leaves me wondering, what does the 40-hours cover? How much is based on verbal de-escalation versus physical response training? I hope that these training are improved to include a focus on getting 5150 calls to a hospital to receive treatment and not straight to a jail cell or body bag.    Link"
497,"I think diversion efforts focus on the non-violent offenders because this population may easier and cheaper to treat than non-violent offenders. I think violent offenders should be offered the same opportunity. Just because someone committed a serious violent crime does not mean that he/she untreatable.  If there is no diversion program in place to treat violent offenders, than that should be the next step. Clinicians should be concerned with with treatment for all offenders suffering from mental illness and not just the non-violent ones. I honestly think those committing violent offenses may actually be in need of treatment more than non-violent offenders, especially if the ultimate goal is rehabilitation and release."
498,"I think the hurdles can be both different and the same depending on the circumstance. Hurdles could be much more difficult in the criminal justice system as it is not as flexible and more based on case precedent versus implementing evidence-based practices; however, when it comes to cases that relied on such practices, it is likely to be easier implementing those practices. Also, getting the research heard is important, so Amicus briefs to the court can really help implementing evidence-based practices. Mental health tends to rely on evidence-based practices and research-based practices; however, it could be difficult in situations involving medications versus therapeutic treatment. "
499,I think it would help the justice system provide full rehabilitative options and not just focus on the punishment aspect of offenders. I think it could help the justice system figure out a better method of handling this population and not just apply its traditional blanket method of punishment/deterrence/rehabilitation. This could save some money also by not housing individuals who actually need treatment more than they need to be imprisoned. Sending those with co-occurring disorders to community programs where they can receive treatment for their disorders and thus recover while improving their lives and well-being. 
500,"Peer mentoring might be helpful in addressing stigma of mental illness because people can learn from actual first-hand experiences of others. This may alleviate stressors, fears, and other issues associated with challenges of mental health problems. The video also mentioned that the mentors actually gain more insight into their own problems. Both will gain valuable experiences from mentorship and likely reduce the stigmas that are challenging those with mental illness."
501,"How might full implementation of the recommendations of the position paper of the American College of Physicians affect the involvement, identification, treatment, and outcomes of the mentally ill in the CJ system?   Involvement Full implementation of the recommendations might affect the involvement of the mentally ill in the CJ system because the evidence shows that integrating behavioral health and primary care leads to improved mental health outcomes for those with mental illness and thus improved physical and mental health leads to improved quality of life which can reduce the number of PWMI’s criminal behavior and interactions with law enforcement altogether (Crowley & Kirschner, 2015). Also, if these services are being provided prior to interacting with the CJ system, it is likely that more PWMI will have been able to take advantage of full implementation and have been receiving some sort of treatment prior to being incarcerated and thus makes the screening process a bit easier for the CJ staff.   Identification Full implementation of the recommendations might affect the identification of the mentally ill in the CJ system because its goals are to create a system that is accessible, affordable, and less stigmatized, thus promoting a care that appeals to the majority of PWMI experiencing barriers to receiving treatment. According to the article, one third of patients with a mental health issue use primary care as their only source of health care and further these adults with severe mental health disorders are more likely to be uninsured than those without such disorders (2015). Full implementation also means this system will ultimately create a pathway to financially support the structure of this system as well as clinical resources necessary for effective integration and thus allow more PWMI to receive be screened, receive treatment, and make it easier to be identified once transferred over into the CJ system after being arrested.     Treatment Full implementation of the recommendations might affect the treatment of the mentally ill in the CJ system by gaining access to better quality care. This full integration calls for staff members to receive training and according to the article, primary care physicians need to be trained to screen, manage, and treat common behavioral health conditions, and behavioral health providers need to be trained to understand care for c"
502,"Great Post Clara! You made some pretty good points about how full integration would benefit PWMI in the criminal justice system. Some of the recommendations discussed biases and stigmas of both PWMI and the staff providing the treatment. It is hard to consider the fact that a barrier to treatment can be stigmatization in that PWMI may not want to seek treatment due to what people may think about them and how they would appeal to society. It is hard enough knowing that a great majority of society already assume that they are violent and dangerous. The last thing we need are people trying to seek treatment only to be shunned by people calling them dangerous, crazy, and the next mass shooter. Also, I was moved by the part of the article that discussed how even treatment staff may even have stigmas. Decreasing stigma is very important and to see it discussed in the recommendations gives hope for what full integration can really do for PWMI and the CJ system."
503,"Great Post Sayla! I enjoyed reading your post and I noticed that similar topics stood out to us both. In particular, I was moved by the discussion of treating the ""whole person."" Throughout this course we have learned about a person's mental illness, about their comorbidity, about homelessness, about their level of perceived dangerousness; however, very seldom do we see discussions about treating PWMI as a whole person and providing treatment from this angle. Munetz and Teller (2004) discussed how mental health and the CJ system are two different worlds and because of that tend to have biases about PWMI and the staff that treats them. Full integration could really help the two fields learn from one another and not be so divided in treatment and management. I do believe that PWMI are likely to benefit from full integration and finally begin to be seen and treated as a whole individual, and not just for the illness or consequence of their illness."
504,"Based on the 60 Minutes video there are several alternatives that could have prevented Timothy Souders from dying in prison. First of all Souders should not have been placed in the prison. A more appropriate placement would have been a State Hospital where Souders could have received treatment. Although prisons have taken on the lead role of caring for mentally ill patients by housing 45,000 in prison to 3,000 in mental institutions; treatment while incarcerated is costly due to psychiatrist availability and the addition of specialty trained staff. Due to limited staff training  most prison facilities are poorly equipped to handle rehabilitation for mentally ill inmates. In fact, beyond the untrained staff component, the 60 minutes piece interviewed the former staff psychiatrist and when asked how he felt Souder's death could have been prevented he indicated that since the staff psychiatrist at that time was unavailable for 7 weeks the facility should have brought in another.   Prison rehabilitation programs are lacking for mentally prisoners and reform efforts leave many untreated.  Finally, although prisoners do not have full Constitutional rights, they remain entitled to as ‘basic rights’. The nature of prisoner litigation aims to hold facilities responsible for providing these rights to inmates and protect against the depravation of basic civil rights. The Eighth Amendment protects inmates from ‘cruel and unusual punishments’ and allows for a reasonable standard of living.As a society we are expected to protect the rights and accommodate the needs of a disabled, however advocacy groups attract  little attention regarding those who are incarcerated.The Americans Disabilities Act (1990) ensures that persons with disabilities have reasonable accommodations made for them which allows equal access and participation to the facilities.- and prohibits discrimination against those with disabilities. This also allows inmates Medical Care for short-term and long-term conditions and Mental Health treatment as appropriate. I feel that if Souders rights had been respected he would have not been subjected to cruel and unusal punishment such as being chained down for up to 17 hours."
505,"I feel that stigma and social status concerns are non-medical considerations that have historically driven treatment and care of persons with mental illness.   Ignoring a mental health condition by sending someone away or electing to commit someone for disobedience, dismissed those persons to inhumane conditions.  Dorothea Dix advocated for asylums (mental hygiene movement) following the Civil War that focused on the physical well being of PWMI who were hospitalized.  Europeans were the first to introduce a 'recovery' model of treatment and introduced a domestic feel to mental asylums moving away from cells and prison-like conditions.  American public awareness was drawn to the conditions in asylums following an autobiography by Clifford Beers which described conditions  he lived in during his stay in a mental institution following a suicide attempt. Beers, along with William James and Adolf Meyer formed the National Committee for Mental Hygiene (later Mental Health America (MHA) that sought to improve conditions and to implement treatment for the mentally ill who were institutionalized based upon his own experiences.   Existing treatment methods were likened to torture and or restraints, physical Lobotomy wasnt discontinued in the mid-1950's after the introduction of psychotropic medications (Thorazine). Anti-psychotic medications produced a medical management treatment which reduced hospitalizations and transitioned hospitalized individuals into a lower level of care which was during the early to mid 1900's pretty much impossible due to a lack of knowledge/funding/programs/changing theories/etc.. Following this was the 1960's and the civil rights movement incorporated the rights of patients in asylums under custodial care or committed involuntarily or unnecessarily; the Community Mental Health Standards Act of 1963 focused on deinstitutionalization however, a lack of supportive programs (medical costs, treatment) and social stigma remain barriers even today.  In our present day, treatment models vary and a wellness/holistic/recovery model encourages peer involvement/employment in outpatient programs; funding is usually through state programs (California= MHSA) or federal grants. While treatment of the mentally ill has changed a great deal over the last 100 years  due to social and legislative reforms I feel that stigma is still a barrrier in care and treatment.  Our lecture brought up NIMBY or a 'Not in my Backyard' sentiment w"
506,"Having an active national database of mentally ill persons for the purpose of reducing gun violence not only vilifies PWMI but it would ignore the actual causes of gun violence.   As stated in the video, often following a horrendous event, such as a mass shooting, we often look for answers by identifying common factors shared by violent people as a way to explain how/why they could commit such a horrible act. By scapegoating or blaming mental illness for the cause for violence of this kind, the media gives the public an excuse to dismiss and address the actual causes of gun violence while perpetuating a myth about PWMI being dangerous. The news media shapes public opinion by providing common narratives of how we structure our lives and opinions. The media has provided information and news to the public that have shaped public political opinions and influenced elections. The American public consumes narratives from the news and entertainment media on what to wear, eat, watch and think regarding social and political issues; this molds public opinion and influences our culture."
507,"Given the challenges PWMI have faced as a result of deinstitutionalization I feel that the most important problem to fix is the lack of social supports. A layered process that begins with reducing stigma and having appropriate funding available to fund wrap around programs that provide, housing, job training and ongoing case management services to PWMI. Instead of pulling back and ignoring PWMI, supportive sponsors commit to mentoring through peer support and help arrange education/work opportunities.  Additionally, the family of PWMI would be able to benefit from having supports and being able to seek assistance instead of trying to conceal a loved one's mental health condition."
508,"For PWMI, I feel that the different views on mental illness have carried a common theme of dangerousness that continues to this day.   Throughout history perceptions and attitude towards PWMI have varied somewhat between sympathy and dangerousness, but overall PWMI are viewed negatively on some level, and for a variety of reasons (popular at the time) excluded from society. As experiences influence the types of attachments we make; interpretations of stimulus; cognitive processes; as well as methods of communication.  I would think that receiving this kind of treatment from others would cause distrust of others, fear of authority /judgement/confinement, and perhaps resentment. So for PWMI, I think self-determination and support from others is essential for breaking traditions of mistreatment through challenging stereotypes and bringing awareness to the public. As social beings, humans have a need for contact with community and support. The relationships we are exposed to influence behavior in many different ways as we seek approval by the degree of perceived human presence whether physical or implied. When persons associate in groups it is typically with purpose and can identify with one another through shared values and beliefs during frequent interactions for a common cause. So, as PWMI are de-valued from groups or dismissed for their disorder, this pushes the individual away from social contact and/or could reinforce a self-doubt that ‘something is  different/wrong with them’.   Without social supports, may PWMI avoid seeking treatment and support, and/or may elect to self-medicate through substance abuse. Loved ones/care givers may also treat the PWMI with less value or see them as a burden; or they may choose to conceal the PWMI conditions for fear that their child/spouse/parent will be treated unkindly."
509,"Great reflection Viviana! I agree with everything you stated. Additionally, the news media  certainly contributes to reinforcing PWMI stereotypes through narratives centered around fear of mental health conditions. Also, the entertainment media tends to vilify PWMI regularly through extreme portrayls of symptoms/situation- truly preying on the lack of public knowledge regarding mental health conditions that in trun the public (on a mass scale) take as their 'education'.    As long as this type of bias is permitted to occur then PWMI will continue to have struggles with being fully accepted in social situations such as the workplace and interactions with LE. Again, great reflection. :)"
510,"Hi Briana, I feel your timeline shows the need for a different approach/ attitude towards PWMI in society is long overdue.  I have worked in behavioral health for 14 years  and came on when the department began introducing peer specialists into outpatient clinics.  Even in this department, there was resistance to adopting peer services- the same ""us and them"" mindset you mentioned. However,  the incorporation of  peers into the workforce has been a huge benefit for case management services and with community outreach/engagement; over time that sided mindset has become nonexistent for the most part in relations between paraprofessional/ clinical staff.  In fact, my program's mental health crisis response teams are 50% peer staffed- we will not send out a team without a peer (population specific and/or family advocate) and a clinician. The largest problem we have is a lack of funding department wide. The peer support trainings are always full and there are just not enough jobs to go around. I would like to see more workforce opportunities extended to PWMI and less scapegoating by the news media, along with the entertainment media being held responsible for misrepresenting mental illness altogether.  L"
511,"A president can bring attention/awareness towards a social cause, such as reducing stigma, through press releases, as well as promoting organizations like the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI).  A President can assist in ending stigma by  supporting legislation that funds trainings and public awareness campaigns specifically targeting stigma. For example, in 2015 President Obama supported the Mental Health First Aid Act that funded training in mental health education, training of first responders and gatekeepers, and promoting prevention and early intervention programs.   "
512,"From my perspective I feel that the movement toward reducing benefits for mental health care by policymakers conveys a message of devaluing those services or failing recognizing the importance of providing those services to consumers.  By not recognizing the need for mental health care services and supportive services to people on aid, or who do not have the financial means to afford out of pocket expense for the services, it limits who received mental health care treatment. Additionally, by spending those funds elsewhere, it is a slight to the personal perception of the individual as they may feel devalued as a person."
513,"Since there has been an increase in the need for psychiatric services/ medications for veterans between 2005- 2011 to 1 in 6 (7 times as much) , it appears that medications have become the go to solution instead of counseling to actually deal with experiences and supportive services within the communities for adjustments when returning to civilian lifestyle.   Given the service member’s experiences with medication for mental illness in the military, I would recommend a better assessment process replace the 30 question screening tool and immediate medication access, then provide group and one on one mental health trauma counseling for active military as well as veterans."
514,"I do not feel that society as a whole should feel a need to step in and mandate medication treatment unless there is a danger to self or others due to either MI related delusion or irrationality, or where MI has caused a medical issue to occur. However, at times PWMI come to the attention of agencies only when they have reached the point of crisis- at that point there is a need to stabilize then educate about their MI and treatment options. When PWMI fail to acknowledge that they are ill due to a lack of insight, then I feel they should be educated regarding their conditions, symptoms and all possible treatments for the purpose of making a decision as to how best manage their symptoms. "
515,"Since public stigma is the reaction of the general population towards people with mental illness that effects attitude towards and individual interactions with PWMI through a reliance on stereotypes- it is important to educate the public and do away with stereotypes. Once a person with mental illness becomes aware of the stereotype, they may apply it towards themselves through self-stigma.  The results of self-stigma include reduced self-esteem, concealing a mental health condition or avoiding treatment, and self-medicating. Given the various forms of stigma (public stigma and self-stigma) related to PWMI, I feel that public education of children should focus on their student body and then expand to include  the long-term effects of stigma that carry through out a person’s lifetime, and promote how school age children across ages can be part of the change in how society views PWMI. By making the population relatable to the audience, children across ages may develop more empathy and in turn reduce the ‘us versus them’ mindset that is common in society. By providing children the chance to be more sensitive to PWMI, fellow students are not ashamed or embarrassed to reach out for help when needed."
516,"Hi Denise, I really like your suggestions about age-specific materials and teachings as I feel many times material isn't presented in the correct context to younger children- using terms they cannot understand or materials that are not explained. With adolescents material may be presented in a way that they cannot apply directly to subjects they are studying which is a perfect opportunity to incorporate certain MI conditions into biology courses during portions on brain development. For high-school incorporating the stigma encountered by PWMI should be the focus on science courses and psychology should be available to take for a life-sciences credit- currently it is offered in my school district as an elective and only open to AP students during their Junior and Senior years.  In all settings, I think that school administrators should promote the importance of anti-stigma and anti-bullying campaigns and look to enhance peer driven support models that reduce PWMI being excluded from student body activities.  "
517,"Briana, You have brought up an excellent example of stigma by discussing the comparison of placing importance on the treatment of physical/medical conditions versus treatment for mental health conditions.   I think that many of the accepted  physical medical conditions/illnesses that you have mentioned are perfect for leading into discussions regarding mental health symptoms that may accompany- but you are right people, this is because people are more receptive of the medical/physical condition that may cause mental health symptoms instead of acknowledging that a mental illness may be causing the physical symptoms. As Always, - Great post. :)"
518,"When considering the concepts of specificity and sensitivity as presented in the video and applying these concepts to civil commitments, I feel that we are weighing the risk of dangerousness to others towards a decision to commit someone for an undetermined amount of time. For example with a sex offender who has completed their criminal sentence, but who is diagnosed with a mental disorder that meets criteria for civil commitment as a sexually violent predator, includes a high risk of recidivism. While many times the persons who share this diagnosis may not reoffend (specificity), there is a group who do and our example/the offender shares enough factors to fall into the portion of people who have reoffended."
519,"I feel that it is 'good or bad' based upon perspective. If one is looking at eliminating the risk of re-offending , and no treatment  is available, then removing the individual is the only solution. -but it is bad, because the sentence for the crime is completed and conceptually the punishment if fulfilled. So, it is my opinion that the present sentencing for sex offenders does not reflect the seriousness of the crime/punishment that is expected by the public and that there is not a treatment to ‘reform’ tendencies of a sexually violent predator in an inpatient or outpatient setting. However, I feel civil commitment following serving a prison sentence is unfair as the sentence has been served and it punishes an individual for a mental health diagnosis without proof that they will re-offend. Remedies to the policy conflict are to either extend the length of sentencing for sexually violent offenses and include mandatory compliance with treatment; or find effective and permanent treatments for sexually violent offenders that reduces the tendencies/ability for the offender to re-offend."
520,"Both inpatient and outpatient commitment may be involuntary and while inpatient commitment length of stay can be indefinite, both are restricting individual liberty.  However, I feel that outpatient commitment is a larger reach of state authority into an individual’s liberty as compliance is forced through threat/coercion as non-compliance with treatments/ medication may result in contempt charges and a loss of freedom. In order to remain ‘free’ a PWMI must comply with the prescribed treatment plan for their mental illness even if they do not agree with that treatment, additionally there may be certain criteria to remain in the supportive housing assistance programs (curfews, cleanliness, etc.)."
521,"Regardless of the type, there are many shared pros and cons to involuntary commitment. Both show an increase in medication and treatment compliance for the purpose of protecting society. However, both types of involuntary commitment use coercion for compliance, disregard individual liberty to some extent, and both force treatment on a PWMI. I feel that both types of involuntary commitment are in place to treat the characteristics of mental illness and to assist in reaching treatment goals so that the PWMI can be stepped down to a lower level of care/treatment. Appropriate measures of success for these forms of treatments would be a reduction in backslides and maintaining outpatient care on a voluntary basis. This could be measured through a reduction in hospitalizations and reduced contact with law enforcement. As shared characteristics include homelessness, low income, and  un-educated or undereducated academically;  I feel that case management services that assist in providing housing, education opportunities, job training, and financial assistance would be essential to not only maintain the lower level of care for a PWMI but to also assist in strengthening or re-establishing the role of the therapeutic provider so that the individual continues treatment on a voluntary basis."
522,"Hi Bobbi,   I enjoyed reading you response. While the overall goal is to have  PWMI involved in their treatment and accessing services in the community, I think most times there is 'an event' or episode that brings to light the treatment need. So I do not think that the population being treated on an involuntary basis would seek out treatment  initially which is how and why they enter the system through a gatekeeper agency, such as through law enforcement contact or the emergency room. Many times PWMI go untreated efor several reasons that you and our classmates have mentioned. Once law enforcement or the emergency department places the PWMI on a hold and diverts them for psychiatric evaluation the purpose of ETS is really to stabilize while minimizing hospital emergency room use or unnecessarily jailing a person.  When maintaining treatment is optional I feel it is important that the community agency where they are receiving services on an outpatient basis  provide support in the form of education regarding their illness, socialization groups, transportation,targeted case management and linkages to other services and agencies-pretty much anything they need to ensure they maintain their treatment on an outpatient basis."
523,"Hi Cornise, I agree with your position on tragedy driven policies as many times the pubic and media search for a common factor as an explanation and settle on a mental illness, or the perpetrator have had some type of counseling however long ago, as a scapegoat. In doing so, policy makers may overlook the true common factor or fail to make changes to security and policy, and all the while perpetuate stereotypes that PWMI are dangerous.  Tragedies surrounding Kendra Webdale and then Edgar Rivera brought attention to the need to provide means for treatment to PWMI who were frequenting emergency departments but either were unable to afford treatment and turned away or had problems maintaining a medication regiment, were unable to safely survive in the community, and had violent episodes of harming self or others. While the program did bring care to those who were untreated and at risk, it also became a campaign to increase public safety and stigmatized its application.   In regards to the allegations of racial bias in New York Stat's out patient commitment program, as pointed out by Swanson, et al. (2009) the use of outpatient orders were  disproportionate to the overall population of the State between 1999-2008, 35% of outpatient commitments were made to African-Americans who were 17% of the population, while 33% were white who were 61% of the population. BUT it is my understanding from the reading that this was not due to racial bias on the part of the outpatient commitment program  but more to do with the effects of disparity- who can afford to get quality care, who goes untreated and where (public/private health care)."
524,"I would think that PWMI would have several difficulties with navigating the criminal justice system such as understanding the stages of the process, or the consequences of charges being brought against them, most people do;    but that the most difficult stage is the initial contact with law enforcement as at that time or during interviews a PWMI may respond in a way that leads to being detained, or be generally uncooperative due to stress. Law enforcement officers are usually  first responders to a 911 call and while police are regularly portrayed as bias towards PWMI, I think it has more to do with a lack of training in identifying and interacting with PWMI, as well as a lack of resources/funding. I feel that this is where cooperative agencies (County mental health) should assist in funding trainings to law enforcement agencies to enhance services to the population served, and provide clinical staff to assist officers in deferring PWMI to the most appropriate level of care at that time."
525,"The recent changes in California corrections shifts responsibility for those convicted of felonies from State to local jurisdictions with potential challenges to PWMI such as medical and mental health treatment, and housing.  To address the challenges of providing for the needs of PWMI, alternative courts and deferment to emergency departments (medical) of emergency psychological services may provide  more appropriate alternative as this keeps the person with mental illness from entering the Criminal Justice System where they would not receive treatment and support as a result of budget cuts to staffing. Benefits to PWMI that this challenge brings is avoiding incarceration and actually receiving treatment as the County mental health must explore alternatives to meet the needs of the population they serve. Better agency collaborations should be fostered (especially with law enforcement)  and initiating programs through grant-funded opportunities allows counties to explore alternative programs. For example, SB 82 the Mental Health Wellness Act of 2013 and fund crisis intervention programs through mobile crisis support, of which may divert PWMI to mental health urgent care facilities or temporary residential treatment. SB82 grants are usually awarded with funding for a two-year start up and if successful are funded through the Mental Health Services Act.  "
526,"With such a small amount of mental health education and training provided to law enforcement I don’t think that it is ‘fair’ to any party that officers often serve as first responders to situations involving PWMI. Our emergency response system (911) dispatches calls to those available and mental health agencies are not 24/7. For officers dispatched to calls concerning PWMI there tend to be limits to the resources or options available to them, and a lack of cooperation from other agencies. For individuals with mental illness who are in crisis, having law enforcement respond to a call may increase tensions or be frightening. However, I feel that most police are aware of how they may be received and approach interactions sensitively while seeking to de escalate tensions so that they can transport the individual to emergency services for evaluation. I feel the most useful responses would be to pair law enforcement officers with clinicians from mental health agencies. Unfortunately, these are difficult to fund as both the County MH departments and City agencies have limited funds for programs with low direct service and each law enforcement agency varies in how they want to structure their service model."
527,"Crisis Intervention Training (CIT) and stigma are related as prior to the Memphis model PWMI were likely to be placed in the criminal justice system instead of gaining access to the medical/mental health system and supportive resources.  CIT provides education to police officers regarding some signs and symptoms of mental illness as well as interactions with consumers of mental health services. The interactions serve to assist in reducing stigma; Instead of having to rely on stereotypes regarding PWMI, officers are able to draw from personal experience."
528,"The Memphis Model of Crisis Intervention is a training model (CIT) established by the Memphis Police department, in collaboration with the National Alliance for Mental Illness (NAMI) that provides de-escalation techniques and education to officers who may interact with persons with mental illness in crisis while serving the community. CIT is widely used throughout the country by law enforcement agencies in an effort to reduce incarceration of persons with mental illness. The training has focused on the diversion of persons with mental illness to mental health treatment services, as a more appropriate level of care, and away from entry into the criminal justice system. As law enforcement officers are usually the first responders to a call for assistance, Crisis Intervention Training and diversion to other agencies is at times the only opportunity for a person with mental illness to gain access to treatment or become linked to assistance for other supports in the community.  A component of the training is the education to law enforcement officers regarding mental illness and psychotropic medications, along with de-escalation tactics that reduce arrests and use of force by law enforcement. The evaluation by Taheri (2016) acknowledged the positive outcomes reported in past studies regarding reducing stigma of mental illness and perceptions of persons with mental illness (PWMI) by law enforcement but sought to examine the effectiveness on the core components of the Memphis Model: arrest reduction, use of force, and officer safety.  Through a systematic review and meta- analysis of research related to CIT, a limited number of studies (8) met inclusion criteria and examined arrest reduction, use of force by law enforcement towards PWMI, and officer injury when interacting with PWMI.  Findings of the systematic review did not provide evidence to conclude effectiveness towards the core components of reduction in officer injury, arrest rate and use of force but indicated this may be due to the lack of studies that examined these components and the variety of models in use.   Given the findings of the study, I would recommend continued use of the Crisis Intervention Trainings to assist with education to officers and reduce stigma, but I would also require departments to implement standardization in training and reporting  of contact with PWMI across the board to measure effectiveness of models.  Making the training mandatory for all staff, includin"
529,"Hi Steve,   Great post! I have enjoyed reading your responses throughout this course due to your first hand experiences. I agree that I would want to see officers trained in CIT than not have the knowledge regarding PWMI and referral agency resources available to them. I also agree that enhancing CIT for effectiveness should be the focus of researchers, as doing away with trainings only limits treatment opportunities and community linkages to the mentally ill. I think the key to measuring the effectiveness of CIT is to accurately capture measurable data specifically to officer contact with PWMI. By not providing CIT training and encouraging collaborations with other agencies, it limits options for officers and would only increase the number of arrests made.   Thank you again, Liisa"
530,"Hi Wendy, I enjoyed reading your response to the discussion prompt. I agree with your position that the education received by law enforcement officers is valuable in deferring persons with mental illness (PWMI) to a more appropriate level of treatment, instead of arresting them. Taheri (2016) mentioned that only a limited number of studies (8) met inclusion criteria and examined arrest reduction, use of force by law enforcement towards PWMI, and officer injury when interacting with PWMI; I feel that this limitation is a concern and that with the this model being replicated in more than 2700 agencies throughout the country (Taheri, 2016), that data collection efforts and reporting should be component of the model to determine its effectiveness.   Taheri, S. A. (2016). Do Crisis Intervention Teams Reduce Arrests and Improve Officer Safety? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Criminal Justice Policy Review, 27(1), 76.

531,"The 60 minutes video discussed that a large amount of re-offenders who had been to the Cook County Jail were there due to property crimes such as trespassing for shelter, and theft for items for basic needs. I feel that this overflow is a reflection of the  lack of  supports available to the community and that instead of jailing some of these offenders, there should be alternatives to assist in solving the issue and actually preventing a return to jail. I would think it would be frustrating for a person with mental illness to only receive assistance when desperate enough to break the law. Especially when after doing so the first, fiftith or hundredth time- linkages to supportive services still did not occur or were not adequate to sustain placement in the community."
532,The concept of indicators that was discussed in the video indicate a correlation between specific factors that may cause a change in another. Three key indicators that I feel jails should measure would be the number of contacts with law enforcement; level of existing outpatient or community supports- if any; and the number of visits to emergency rooms. The reason I would measure these indicators is it speaks to successful/unsuccessful outpatient case management and treatment. I think that amount of law enforcement contact would be a better way to measure service need as many times officers have repeatedly linked an individual to community resources and the supports have not been intense enough to meet the service need. The number of emergency room visits/ or emergency service treatment would look to capture the supportive services not supplied by officer contact. Finally I would look at  missed appointments and the need for medication management. I think these indicators would reflect the quality of services/ case management available to PWMI in the community.
533,"Although prisoners do not have full Constitutional rights, they remain entitled to as ‘basic rights’ and I feel that there are individual freedoms that should be permitted regardless of the offense committed. The reason these rights are important to inmates in to set limitations on establishment towards the the treatment of individuals while serving a rehabilitative term. The Due Process Clause of the US Constitution entitles inmates their right to appeal  as well as their right to a hearing prior to administrative action.  Since inmates face disciplinary action for breaking rules, they are also entitled to due process including disciplinary hearing with 24 hour notice, documented evidence and the reasons the disciplinary action is being implemented. The First Amendment protects and inmate’s right to their freedom of speech but there are limitations. The Eighth Amendment protects inmates from ‘cruel and unusual punishments’ and allows for a reasonable standard of living. The fourteenth Amendment protects against unequal treatment based upon gender (among other differences). The Americans Disabilities Act ensures that persons with disabilities have reasonable accommodations made for them which allow equal access and participation to the facilities. This also allows inmates Medical Care for short-term and long-term conditions and Mental Health treatment as appropriate."
534,"While medication costs consume a large percentage of jail budgets, I feel that it remains the most common treatment for persons with mental illness because the medications are still less expensive than adequate staffing and training to meet the needs of the population. Better treatment for persons with mental illness would be to receive services in a State Hospital or to be diverted to an alternative court and mandatory outpatient care/case management and to  never enter the criminal justice system. Alternative courts would make treatment, instead of punishment, the key to restoring the PWMI in the community and identify long term solutions to reduce barrier to treatment."
535,"  Due to limited training and unpredictability of staffing, most jails are poorly equipped to handle rehabilitation for mentally ill inmates. With a wide spectrum of mental illness diagnosis, prison rehabilitation programs are lacking for mentally ill prisoners and efforts leave many untreated. Alternatives to incarceration include pre-trial diversion programs that when applicable, that may better treat mental health needs; however these programs are not available to all PWMI. Treatment for the mentally ill while incarcerated, is costly to prisons due to psychiatrist availability and the addition of specialty-trained staff.  Psychotropic medications are available to mentally ill inmates however once released from prison, treatment and medications are optional; several felons return to the criminal justice system since they are unable to maintain housing placement and have abnormal behavior without taking medication.  Without adequate discharge planning to outpatient support programs, the risk of returning to incarceration seems likely.  Torrey et al (2010) noted that in a study of data gathered through the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration mentally ill prisoners receive little aftercare. In an stud example 65 patient discharged from an Ohio State hospital nearly half were homeless within six months of being discharges and a third had neem arrested. Authors attributed this finding to self-medicating with alcohol and drugs. I would think that the experience of PWMI in California is affected similarly to this. If unable to access and maintain housing supports, as well as other supportive services, then they would be at risk of homelessness and likely to have a high rate of emergency room visits and encounters with law enforcement.   Torrey, E. F., Kennard, A. D., Eslinger, D., Lamb, R., Pavle, J., National Sheriffs' Association., & Treatment Advocacy Center. (2010). More mentally ill persons are in jails and prisons than hospitals: A survey of the states. Arlington, Va: Treatment Advocacy Center"
536,"Hi Wendy, I really enjoyed your post! I agree with all of your points supporting why jail is never an appropriate placement for person's with mental illness, especially that you brought up the likelihood of victimization when PWMI are housed with violent offenders. Many of the inmates who commit violent attacks in prison are criminals convicted of violent crimes or have a history of violence against others. Overcrowding is common in prisons: leading to prison violence due to the facility being understaffed and an increasing demand for resources. Due to facilities being understaffed, violence between inmates can occur anywhere in a facility as can self harm. Again, great post! L.    "
537,"  Well I think that a lot of specialty courts have started up in California over the past 15 years, substance use, mental health and homeless diversion programs have been underway and picking up momentum. Mental Health Court started in my county (Riverside) in 2001. I think Orange County had pilot programs in the mid 90's- but it takes awhile for county level government behavioral health agencies  to get things 'right' with a model as there's a small amount of funding shifted around trying to find the biggest effect for the least amount of funding. I am sure outpatient programs with intensive case management are available but here in Riverside County persons with mental illness who have committed misdemeanor offenses may be directed to a treatment program at a State Hospital (Patton is in my area) as an alternative to having to go to jail, an option that is offered at the discretion of the judge. Failure to complete the program risks removal from the program and a return to the jail system. Even if a client completes the program there may be challenges to maintain in the community. Housing supports following transition back into the community setting are often a huge challenge that we face with PWMI as we have limited mental health housing and facilities available that accept clients (mostly due to stigma). Some have strict behavior guidelines that clients at times have a tough time sticking to. Many are in areas where the clients may have easy access to methods of substance use."
538,"Risk assessment tools are used in pretrial, parole, and sentencing decisions and consider certain factors (depending on the tool) when coming to a decision in determining a criminal defendant’s likelihood of committing a crime in the future. I would not think that it is ‘fair’ to use risk assessment tools that were not accurate as In many ways using a tool to ‘predict’ behavior of a defendant (someone not yet convicted) or someone who has completed a sentence (parole) is unfair as the risk is determined upon events or factors that have already occurred, and may ignore contributing circumstances to the original offense – such as crimes of need that are resolved with community support/services and or medical/mental health treatment. In addition, interpretation of the results when using some tests may be subjected to bias on the part of the evaluator."
539,"I think the mental health professionals would be receptive to the  to the approach as the Risk Need Responsivity (RNR) model contends that recidivism  can be reduced if treatment provided eliminates the need for the behavior to take place through responsivity, or the mode of intervention (CBT, etc). So differentiating the major and minor needs/ risk factors of the PWMI, and looking for supports to reduce stressors/indicators of the undesired behaviors through interventions/supports.  Other factors mental health professionals would be concerned about in the community would be the influencers (unpredicted events/circumstances) that would cause an intervention support to fail or for the influence to create a new major risk factor that the PWMI does not have the support to handle and causes known /previous behaviors to emerge."
540,"In this video San Diego Chief Probation Officer Mack Jenkins discusses how probation in that County meets the specific needs of people under probation to deter criminal behavior through providing case management that  meets the needs of  social supports and treatment, as well as supervision, to remain in the community and avoid incarceration. Also touched on is the cost savings associated with  California's Public Safety Realignment law and still meeting the need of around 400,000 people pointing out that having someone on probation has an annual cost to the taxpayer of around $1500 versus $50000/annually for an individual to be housed in the prison system. Since probation services has an individualized treatment plan that case management services are structured around and can include mental health treatment as a condition of remaining in the community , I think that probation is better suited to address the supervision and treatment needs of PWMI instead of jails where treatment may be limited strictly to medication."
541,"As a participant in a mental health court I would take advantage of the opportunities to secure treatment and social supports available through case management services, and avoid incarceration. While I could not argue the decisions made by the court, I could work with the clinician assigned to case manage my progress with orders and see how to obtain a recommendation to return to the home setting. While the conditions ordered may not be optimal to all individuals, such as the woman who was upset she was being placed in an adult residential facility (ART) as she would ‘lose’ her SSI, at times this is necessary to ensure pateint compliance with the treatment orders - and to ensure the treatment ordered by the judge will be carried out by certain agencies. On the losing of the SSI benefit- I believe it usually goes over to the Public Guardian to assist in paying for their stay in an ART- if that is the case- but it is not available to other parties who may be in the home."
542,"I would advise a Chief Probation Officer to structure the treatment plan around rehabilitating the criminalistic behaviors, and to address the mental health diagnosis/treatment as service need in the RVR model. As the mental illness and symptoms are not responsible for the criminal action in itself, failing to address the therapeutic goals to change criminal behavior that resulted in the action/offense would not address the procriminal attitude. A recent study (Peterson, Skeem, Kennealy, Bray, & Zvonkovic, 2014) found that a very small group of offenders engaged in criminal behavior as a direct result of their mental illness symptoms.  As symptoms of mental illness may complicate the treatment for criminal behavior, it must take place to ensure therapeutic service delivery for the correctional treatment. Other elements must exist to reduce the chance of recidivism. I would make components include community service and most importantly behavioral therapy for the MI offender to learn alternatives to their initial offending action.  When using treatment processes in the RNR model, addressing treatment (or the responsivity principle)  for criminal behaviors among persons with mental illness varies in effective delivery technique for persons with PWMI;  generally successful techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective when used for non – PWMI offenders, it may not be successful  as a strategy for treatment technique for PWMI (Skeem, Steadman, & Manchak, 2015). For managing symptoms of mental illness and treatment, as well as addressing factors that contribute to a ‘need’,  it is important to identify all stressors that may contribute to a return to needs related criminal behaviors by addressing supportive housing and substance use issues. However, I would caution that eliminating the stressors of needs crimes, doesn’t reduce criminal behavior entirely- again to focus on the therapeutic goals of reducing the criminal behavior. As in the RNR model, providing for the needs includes supportive services but it also includes eliminating stressors by differentiating the major and minor needs. So in addition to identifying risk factors of the PWMI, and looking for supports to reduce stressors/indicators of the undesired behaviors through interventions/supports.. As many conditions of probation include a condition to not associate with those engaged in criminal activity it would seem reasonable to exclude contact with substance using per"
543,"I would think 90 day reassessment and a step down process would encourage the PWMI to be goal orientated in complying and maintaining their treatment plan for short term goals, then a step down housing process to maintain treatment goals while easing into more independent living environments- like a 3 day pass into a group setting/board and care. I would think certain PWMI that have a history of substance abuse (co occurring disorder) are more fragile in maintaining placement and that any step down housing for this population should not be located in close proximity to where drugs and alcohol are easily accessible as it would create more issues. -They would have increased risk in substance use and likely not maintain mental health treatment, then engage in behaviors that return them to the correctional setting."
544,"Hi Nani,   Great post! I like that you included the need for additional training for probation officers to include more education regarding mental illness as to better understand and support the population they are supporting. I think that addressing the needs of offenders that have mental illness can really only be effective with specialty case management as traditional supports and monitoring wouldn't ensure compliance with treatment- whatever it may be . The other advantage offered in a smaller case load with more intensive case management is that the client has someone to assist in linkages with supportive agencies that specialize in housing, medical care, benefits, peer services and all other supports from community agencies that may seem overwhelming to navigate.   Again, great post! "
545,"I feel there are several components and situations in the prison environment that may aggravate the condition of persons with mental illness. The video discussed the effects of segregation/ solitary confinement, as well as  cell extractions and violent responses on the part of the guards/establishment. Between these practices and the effects of overcrowding leading to prison violence due to the facility being understaffed and an increasing demand for resources. Due to facilities being understaffed, there may be faults in the supervision of inmates and violence can occur anywhere in a facility. The proliferation of gangs in the prison system threatens an inmate’s quality of life because of the threat of victimization or violence.  Motives for violence between inmates may range from a disagreement to a struggle for power and dominance over others. Motives for violence against staff occurs when inmates become rebellious against the guards who monitor them or when prisoners harbor animosity towards the criminal justice system overall.  All of these stressors may contribute to risk of self-harm due to an existing mental illness; OR a mental illness (PTSD) that has developed during incarceration due to the treatment received from inmates and staff, or true fear of violence. The fear of victimization often cause an inmate to isolate or avoid group settings, such as the recreation yard. Social isolation while incarcerated is compounded by the fact that an inmate's friends and family members may cease being a source of support due to the disassociation by family members related to stigma; or age related death and illnesses.  "
546,"Considering the discussion in the video ‘Mental Illness in Prisons’ I DO think that it is possible to rehabilitate prisoners who have mental illness once the treatment needs are addressed. Following meeting any medical and mental health needs, the inmate should then be exposed to rehabilitative education as correction to deter from future criminal behavior. I can understand the frustrations of professionals who equate the criminal act because of the mental illness- due to the symptoms of the mental illness; as the reluctance towards medication compliance becomes the barrier to rehabilitation and maintaining permanency in the community.  So the treatment plan should really be release focused day one and addressing the need for medication to the inmate so that they really understand the importance of compliance.  If a specific medication were necessary, I would think that an injectable medication could be an option and regular out patient appointments."
547,"In a super max prison the inmate spends 23 hours a day locked in their cells and are escorted by a minimum of three officers for their five hours of private recreation per week. During their hour of supervised exercise, inmates remain indoors to prevent them knowing their location within the facility. The enclosed area is monitored by guards and large enough for a prisoner to walk 10 steps in a straight line, or 30 steps in a circle. Advantages of solitary confinement for maintaining order are limited to a cost savings of supervisory staff, control of the inmate, and lack of confrontation between prisoners. The disadvantages to the inmate outweigh the advantage of maintaining order for the prison as disadvantages include increased agitation, paranoia, and anger of the inmate; all of these exacerbate mental health symptoms. Moreover, there is the complete missed opportunity for treatment for a PWMI and corrective efforts towards the criminal behavior/act that occurred initially."
548,"After watching the video ‘Cost to Treat Mental Illness in Prison Rising’, 1 in 4 prisoners are receiving mental health care with the majority of those treatment services are limited to medication expenses.  As according to the Department of Human Services, the treatment cost has a staggering difference of $2200 per person in the community to $22000 in the prison system. As a taxpayer, I feel that my money would be better-spent funding treatment opportunities in the community such as alternative courts and probation. Doing so would ensure that persons with mental illness have more options for treatment and assist with funding going towards other and supportive services in the community, and overall avoiding the costs of incarceration."
549,"I do not see how prisons can accomplish cost containment with increased staffing costs and medication costs are needed to treat prisoners with mental illness. While the courts are slow to adapt to the needs of society there is a growing population of PWMI incarcerated and receiving limited medication treatment services, only to return following release. This seems like a clear message that more focus needs to be on addressing the needs and cost of mental health treatment separately from the incarceration setting.   The prison environment is inadequate for providing needed treatment for persons with mental illness and creates a treatment- custody conflict (Adams and Ferrandino, 2018), as this shifts large budget costs and efforts from criminal behavioral rehabilitation for all, to mental health treatment (medications mostly) for the smaller population of offenders. Despite the population of offenders who have a mental illness being smaller, the cost is higher as offenders with mental illness spend more time in the prison environment that those who do not have a mental illness and require expensive medications.  In this week’s video, Cost to Treat Mental Illness in Prison Rising, according to the Department of Human Services, the treatment cost has a staggering difference of $2,200 per person in the community versus $22,000 in the prison system. Although prisons have taken on the lead role of caring for mentally ill patients, treatment while incarcerated is costly due to psychiatrist availability and the addition of specialty trained staff. Psychotropic medications are the go to treatment for mentally ill inmates but once released from prison, treatment and medications are optional in some cases and difficult to maintain in the community settings; making a return to the criminal justice system more likely since they are unable to maintain placement (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013).  This resource gap leaves treatment needs unmet and reduces the budget for adequate training and staffing (Adams and Ferrandino, 2018).  Due to facilities being understaffed, violence between inmates can occur anywhere in a facility. Prisoners with mental illness are more likely than other inmates to have disciplinary infractions that are both aggressive and non-aggressive that in turn lead to longer sentences than prisoners who do not have mental illnesses, as their mental illness is not taken into consideration when infractions occur (Slate, Buf"
550,"Hi Briana, I have to agree that aside from substantial medication cost and the expense of contracting for psychological services, that inmates with mental illness receive a similar amount of services to inmates who do not have a mental illness.  I would think that the medication mode of treatment is regarded overall more cost effective instead of treatment and supplimental programs since mental illness cannot be 'cured', but symptoms can be managed (through meds). Interestingly, the Federal Bureau of Prisons  does sponsor  drug rehabilitation programs for inmates with a history of drug use may  require specialized medical care for physical addictions or drug-related illnesses on a limited basis. In addition to providing the drug treatment program to aid in the rehabilitation of the offender, some of these programs are residential and separated from general population; others are Drug Abuse Education groups that are supplemented by other programs that help complement it such as education, work skills training, recreation, disease prevention, and health promotion instruction.   I would like to see the medication management and mental illness education made available to those incarcerated with MI, and then supplemental programs alike to those provided in the Drug Abuse Education programs.   https://www.alec.org/article/drug-treatment-programs-of-the-federal-bureau-of-prisons-exist-but-need-more-availability/  "
551,"Hi Caroline, I agree with your position that overall persons with mental illness should not be treated in prisons and instead, funding would be better spent in diverting to mental hospitals or community care programs where actual treatment can occur. While an expense for medication is likely unavoidable no matter the environment, the person with mental illness would have access to treatment for symptom management, medication management, mental illness education and linkages to agencies that could assist in maintaining residency in the community.  In addition to this, the person with mental illness would not have to contend with dual stigma, or the stigma associated with challenges following release from incarceration.  Again great post!

552,"If I were a taxpayer in Missouri, I would be happy about the construction of the new Fulton State Hospital. Built in 1851, the hospital in Fulton was the oldest state hospital in Missouri so a new building would be safer for patients receiving care and staff who work there. Additionally, with the new facility would come the opportunity to increase bed availability and staffing – which would bring more job opportunities to the area.  I think that including building upgrades like large meeting rooms would increase the social interactions between patients by allowing treatment providers to run groups."
553,"The not guilty by reason of insanity plea is a defense that allows a mentally ill person to avoid being imprisoned for a crime on the assumption that he or she is too impaired, on account of their mental illness, to be held accountable for their actions at the time of the crime.  Mental illness at the time of the offense is a prerequisite but not determine judgement as just because the person has a mental illness does not mean that they cannot understand the difference between right from wrong - or be held accountable for their actions. To meet criteria it must be determined by a court appointed expert that due to their mental disorder at the time of the crime they either/or did not understand what they were doing; that what they were doing was illegal; or they were compelled to commit the crime due to their mental illness. This sentence is meant to replace jail time with psychiatric treatment.   I would not describe this defense as a ‘get out of jail free card’ because it does not reduce the penalty or sentence of the crime, in fact the judge may keep the offender hospitalized for longer than serving their incarceration term would have been on account of early release programs.   "
554,"With a 90% forensic referred population, I think that state hospitals can best deal with patient and staff safety by selecting staff who are able to perform the appropriate job duties and understand that they are working in an environment where the risk of violence is a constant concern due to the population they are providing services to.  In addition to this, a regular review and retraining of the security measures in place should occur frequently, and include enhancements to the facility to avoid risk of harm to self (cameras, site upgrades, etc.). As the majority of patients in the hospital are unpredictable and have committed a criminal offense, staffing that includes trained security is essential to ensure that medical professionals can do their job and so other patients are not put at risk by a violent offender. I do not think that any staffing or budget cuts should come at the expense of quality of care or safe conditions for the patients/staff."
555,"Surgical implants are used in other parts of the body to extend life and contribute to quality of life, I don't see why the brain should be excluded.In watching the video I have mixed feelings regarding the use of deep brain stimulation as a treatment for depression mainly because of the known and unknown risks associated with having electrodes implanted in someone's brain. It is fascinating that Dr. Mayberg and associates were able to map the brain and have successful out comes with two-thirds of the patients, but I would be concerned about the third of unsuccessful outcomes and  other known risks such as infection. "
556,"I feel that the role of state hospitals should be to treat severely and persistently mentally ill persons, and not utilized almost exclusively for forensic patients. While the population of the United States has doubled over the 60 years, the availability of psychiatric in-patient beds has declined to lows circa of the 1850’s (Sisti, Segal and Emanuel, 2015).  California has the largest population in the United States, nearly 40 million people (recorded) yet a limited amount of bed available in Atascadero, Coalinga, Metropolitan, Napa and Patton state hospitals with the majority of those serving forensic patients (90%).  As an innovative approach, I feel that policy makers at a county level should take the largest forensic patient population served and pilot a program to meet their specific needs. Those patients who have been found incompetent to stand trial (IST) make up the largest percentage of the state hospital patient population according to the Department of State Hospital Annual Report for 2018. At 21%, IST patients would benefit more from a separate setting where they could receive treatment for their mental illness in the form of medication and therapy, while receiving education regarding the offense, legal processes and roles of the court.  Since the California Department of State Hospitals 2018 Annual Report indicated a steep increase of referrals of patients who were incompetent to stand trial between the 13/14 fiscal year and the 17/18 fiscal year, referrals increased 60% and research suggests that more than 50% were homeless at the time of arrest (DSH, Annual Report 2018). Establishing programs to restore competency and then diverting offenders to alternative courts for mental illness, homelessness, or substance abuse- allows the offender an opportunity for treatment and supportive services that were a factor of the criminal behavior, while avoiding incarceration. Programs of this kind would not only make better use of tax payer funds in reducing forensic hospitalization/unnecessary incarceration, but it would open up available beds for civil commitments and care for those in the community with severe and persistent mental illness that lower levels of care cannot provide. Sisti, D., Segal, A. and Emanuel, E. (2015). Improving Long-term Psychiatric Care: Bring Back the Asylum JAMA, 313 (3), 243-244. The California Department of State Hospitals. (2018).  2018 Annual Report. Retrieved from https://www.dsh.ca.gov/Publi"
557,"Hi Elise, Great Post! I like your idea of separating the treatment needs of forensic patients but since there are so few facilities across the state, I suggested this take place at a County level.  Reducing the number of forensic patients in State Hospitals would allow for more civil commitments and ensure that persons with severe mental illness in the community can receive necessary care and that the County  isn't having to spend extra funds  in a bidding war with other counties to contract for the  limited beds. In addition, the forensic patient could receive treatment and services for their mental illness in conjunction with rehabilitation services for their criminal behavior so that they could be transitioned to an alternative court if appropriate.  It would seem to me that addressing the criminal behaviors of the forensic patient in the State Hospital setting would be secondary to their mental illness, if occurring at all. Again, great post! Liisa"
558,"Hi Elise, Thank you so much for your response. I am actually writing my final paper on this topic and I feel it may help in some areas but that there really isn't a blanket approach to solve any of the MH/CJS problems we have gone over during this quarter. I feel that the solution I purpose would certainly assist the overall impact of State hospitals if treatment and education  of IST patients  took place in another setting and at the county level in areas where homeless arrests accounted for a strong portion of IST.   After competency is 'restored' then I would like to see those individuals diverted to more appropriate treatment settings by was of specialty courts. I know we learned a week or so back that the specialty courts are limited in the number of cases monitored but I hope to see these courts and related services expand. Proposition 63,  MHSA, allows spending on prevention, early intervention and crisis services but the original language didnt allow for those funds to be used for persons on parole .  SB 389  is a bill signed by Newsom recently that allows MHSA funds to be used to serve individuals on parole as well as those in other pre-sentencing, post-release and diversion programs. In theory, moving that 20% out of the hospital would fee up a decent amount of beds for civil commitments (30%ish) where non violent persons with  severe mental illness could be stabilized, treated and stepped down to a lower level of care. -But there would have to be some kind of formal arrangement DSH that capped the percentage of forensic patients in a given facility.  Just some of my thoughts.   Thank you again, Liisa  "
559,"  I think that inter-agency collaboration is vital to serving the public when their needs extends across multiple agencies. For persons already incarcerated I feel that familiarization with supportive services should be a part of their corrections process. Case management should begin at the point of entry and focus on education and linkages to services following release. Therefore, the concept of a warm hand off – versus the cold shoulder, piece of paper- gives the individual knowledge of how to access community services.  I am not really sold on a Justice and Health Data Exchange system/database as the information contained therein may be accessible when not completely necessary. However, I love the concept of shared department resources such as staffing of liaisons that allow an extension of services to those provided (such as MH clinicians embedded in police stations) and multidisciplinary committees that are able to identify clients accessing services repeatedly and/or across agencies.  "
560,"The professionals in the video used their Crisis Intervention Training (CIT) skillset to calm and reduce the anxiety of their person with mental illness so that they could engage and obtain relevant information for assisting. The CIT officer was empathetic, approached ‘Rick’ calmly, and listened to what was troubling him – then established that they are there to assist and to help – not for any criminal infraction. This process differs from the fact-finding process sometimes used by law enforcement when responding to a call for criminal activity. The CIT officer explained their purpose completely to reduce the subject’s anxiety. While this was occurring, another officer provided a warm hand off to the family member/girlfriend to the social worker/clinician for family supportive services and to obtain more details as to what occurred prior to LE arrival that prompted the call to 911. The CIT trained EMT was able to calm the subject when preparing for transport while explaining the reason why they needed to wear a seatbelt while on a gurney."
561,"I feel it takes a court order or other legal action for the department of corrections to change the way persons with mental illness are treated for two reasons: the practices go against current policy, and the reluctance to admit to wrongdoing on the part of the agency at fault. I assume that the department of corrections must approve specific trainings before those trainings are introduced into the required trainings and that policies must be updated to reflect the specific training. Certain practices and procedures when responding to a person with mental illness would have to be uniform through out  - so there is the retraining of existing staff, a review and policy change on documented procedure, and then the training of new staff."
562,Challenges that mental health workers might deal with in the correctional environment may be an unwelcoming space that limits effective treatment and interactions with other inmates that may make the MI client feel threatened or anxious. Personal challenges that the worker may feel may be concerns for their personal safety or a lack of supports in the services they are providing. I think that cross-training with correctional agencies/staff would help with developing a care plan when transitioning into the community that was tailored to compliment the methods that were successful while incarcerated.
563,"I feel that people who are employed in the mental health and criminal justice fields would benefit from several of the same trainings such as non violent crisis intervention training for the purpose of de escalating tense interactions with persons with mental illness, or with family members of PWMI during crisis. This is much like the CIT training for officers that was shown during our lectures this week. For staff employed with mental health agencies many times this training is mandatory for clinical staff and even non-clinical staff that may have contact with the public- like office staff and para professionals. Both agencies would benefit from trainings regarding stigma towards persons with mental illness; implicit bias and how it effects decision making; and cultural competency trainings for interactions with a diverse community. Other trainings I feel that would be important for these two agencies would be cross agency interaction for referral training, or for other pubic services such as when housing assistance is needed or processes for collaboration with one another for hand-offs. Such as when Law Enforcement referring to mental health for emergency psychological treatment services in stead of arrest."
564,"Hi Nani,   I think you brought up a great point that both agencies need to understand the roles that each agency provides to the other and that the trainings should occur regularly. I feel that this is very important for inter agency collaboration especially when mental health starts up a new program that can benefit the consumers of another agency that serves the public. Many times community stakeholders are not kept in the know of what program services are specifically available to them by mental health either through a failure to inform and poor collaboration, or staff turn over.  Since mental health agencies are so stratified and often divided by age group and funding source, it's very difficult to acquire a large amount of available agency services - more of a program by program.It's self-defeating on the part of mental health to not have good collaboration with other agencies as the majority determine effectiveness through direct service productivity- so the less activity and referral from outside agencies- the more likely it will fold or be very short lived. "
565,"Hi Natalie,   Great post! I like that you brought up the NAMI-Indiana training as an additional training with CIT that could be used for Law Enforcement agencies. This would be a great resource for LE in providing information regarding mental illness, stigma and suicide awareness. I would also like to see more agencies receiving in-service training by law enforcement agencies concerning making reports/referrals, and the whole 'when and why' to involve law enforcement. While it is sometimes difficult to fund, I think the best collaborations occur with embedding staff, or when specific staff act as liaisons as it removes the grey area on where/when to refer to mental health and the embedded mh staff has up to date resources available to law enforcement."
566,"The diversion efforts in Fairfax are focusing on non-violent offenders due to the nature of the offense being non-violent and a result of their mental illness. These types of offenses are preventable through better community supports and treatment as opposed to  violent behaviors that are a risk to the community. While many of the crimes committed by the non-violent offenders are preventable, rehabilitation and probation are available to more violent offenders with education and treatment that  focuses on the correction of those behaviors as they are  harmful to others however.  Additionally, the cost of housing an inmate with a mental illness is stated to be  four times  higher than an inmate who does not have a mental illness,  so diversion programs are considered a  better use of tax payer funds to for persons with mental illness two-fold: treatment and reduced jail population."
567,"While costs are a concern and hurdle for both the criminal justice system and mental health agencies, I feel that there are more hurdles for mental health agencies in implementing evidence based practices as it means moving away from an existing practice/treatment to avoid a duplication of services to the consumer.  The change in services has to be cost effective and while most start up programs are grant funded, the entire 'more bang for your buck' approach usually determines what programs will remain active after a grant ends and mental health must shift MHSA costs to cover staffing of the progarm.  I work in this field in Riverside County so I lean this way, as I do not know as much about funding for law enforcement agencies. Additional concerns are changes to the care and treatment received by the consumer, as well as other supportive services that they may be receiving and how those services are influenced by receiving a different treatment through funding sources. Other hurdles most often faced with implementing an EBT program is that services are voluntary for the client, so you may not have cooperation.   For example, if my program has a client who is receiving treatment services in one program, must be closed and reopened in the other program to receive services in that new program."
568,An integrated model that seeks to treat mental illness and substance use disorders would benefit the criminal justice system through funding mental health courts/substance use court as a diversion from incarceration. This allows the individual to receive treatment and intensive case management with goal orientated recovery methods in the least restrictive setting.  Models such as SAMSHA’s integrated approach would change the justice system by reducing the population that are incarcerated due to drug related offences while providing treatment for addiction and their mental health condition; MI (antistigma) education to the individual and their family members about addiction and disease; and housing supports to reduce chances of recidivism.
569,"Peer mentoring can assist in addressing stigma of mental illness by giving persons with mental illness a relatable and supportive person to discuss concerns, treatment/medication, and situations with. I think it is common for PWMI to feel insecure or uncomfortable receiving treatment services from clinicians so having someone, a paraprofessional, to relate to and discuss their mental illness with can assist with the client maintaining treatment and aid in advocating for voicing their concerns with treatment or medications. I think that family advocates or parent partners are also very helpful when communicating with the family members of PWMI, assisting in understanding the effects of medication, explaining how their loved one is feeling or issues that are common with mental illness; and finally how they- as a family member- can assist their loved one."
570,"The recommendations made by the American College of Physicians support the integration of behavioral health services into primary care. The purpose provided for these recommendations are to recognize the relationship between physical and mental health, as well as substance use,  and providing services consistent with a holistic approach by treating the individual and eliminating barriers to service.  Many physical symptoms or conditions may be the result of substance use, or a mental illness; just as a mental illness may lead to substance use and health conditions. Authors noted that the majority (68%)of persons with mental illness also have a chronic health condition (Crowley, Kirschner, DeLong, Beach, and Minaei, 2015). For example, someone who is depressed may self-medicate, and/or may have a sedentary lifestyle that effects the functioning of their body through a lack of activity. Treating only one portion of the individual’s health, such as a chronic disease, and not treating a related mental health condition, leaves a gap in treatment where the individual cannot recover. Health is the overall characteristics, habits and functioning, both physically and mentally, as an individual and how we effect our environment and the community. Wellness is the condition achieved when components of health are in balance and maintaining that balance through challenges and are necessary to achieve balance due to their interrelationship within oneself.  Social health is the ability to make and maintain healthy relationships with others. Intellectual health is the ability to think reasonably using objectivity and analytical skills to apply critical thinking when making decisions. Environmental health is the acknowledgement and understanding of the surroundings; which includes an appreciation of the environment, self and all species. Emotional health is the emotional and psychological state of a person and their ability to think rationally and function in everyday life. Spiritual health is the belief in living a balanced life with purpose and applying those personal ethics to the interpretation of actions and stimulus. Authors discussed barriers to integrating health care services were both administrative and financial, this is especially true in California where the mental health services act specifically funds mental health services. The separation of agencies, or silos, lead to a discontinuity in treatment delivery as what mental health treatment services are not"
571,"Clara, I love that you addressed bias among those seeking services for mental health disorders. It wasn't all that long ago that certain physical conditions , like certain types of cancer and AIDS, were also met with stigma in both the social sense and by medical professionals.  Minimizing stigma of mental illness is a benefit of integrated care, as with more awareness comes more understanding. Truly someone who suffers from a disorder should be able to seek out assistance and receive care without fear of being judged, and be able to access services as easily as going to their primary care provider. Great post!"
572,"Hi Wendy, Great post! I have to agree that while the services would be wonderful ,and even possible in in medical and behavioral health care, but that realistic integrated systems and implementation where the criminal justice system is concerned would be difficult.Unless the approach was specific to an integrated service model that was  a part of a diversion program for low level offenders and used as a form of supports that treated the individual, and/or as a part of parole/probation where the integrated services assisted in reducing recidivism- particularly in persons who have a history of substance use. :)"
573," I think that various factors could have prevented Timothy Sounders from dying in prison even before his incarceration. Sounders mother reported that when Timothy had previous hospitalizations struggling with anxiety and depression. She also mentioned that on the night of his arrest, he stated that he wanted the officer to kill him. That statement alone with his background warnts hospitalization. Sounders should have immediately gone to an inpatient facility as he poses a danger to self (DTS) and danger to others (DTO). From there, he could have been stabilized and immediately been evaluated by a behavioral health professional. The Southern Michigan Correctional Center failed Sounders.  When he made self-harm statements and attempted to harm himself again, he should have immediately been seen by a psychiatrist. I do not expect law enforcement officers or correctional officers to understand various mental illnesses, but there should be training in place. At the bare minimum, recognizing when a behavioral health professional is needed. If there were proper training and understanding from the beginning, Sounders would have gone to an inpatient facility and would have received the appropriate treatment preventing his death."
574," Non-medical considerations have driven provisions of treatment and care to be more humanistic. For example, in the Middle Ages, we see an intertwining of religious institutions and governments. Many believed that mental illness was linked to demons or evil spirits. Resulting in the treatment being torture where the Renaissance period through the Pre War era shifts aways from torture and towards a humanistic approach. By providing institutions that would treat individuals ""appropriately"" eliminating punishment. Moreover, there is also a change politically in the treatment and care of or persons with mental illness such as the National Mental Health Act (1946) and the Civil Rights Movement and Right to Treatment Litigation."
575," I do think that a national registry of mentally ill persons would be beneficial because it would prohibit the purchase of a firearm for an individual that wants to harm themselves. However, I do not think that these benefits outweigh the cost. Reducing people with mental illness right to bear arms does not promote a solution to the problem regarding danger and harm to others. As mentioned in the video, individuals may not seek help if they suspect they have a diagnosis and potentially harm themselves. But a national registry of mentally ill persons also solidifies the belief that persons with mental illnesses are dangerous. A national registry of mentally ill persons does not solve the problem of gun violence. Interestingly the video did not mention the types of diagnosis that would prohibit firearm purchases. Would an individual who has ADHD also be denied?"
576," I would say that the first important problem as a result of deinstitutionalization to fix would be for individuals to have safe and secure housing, followed by their medication. Initially, I thought persons with mental illness needing their medication would be the immediate problem that needs to be fixed, but housing is a physiological need. Without proper housing, individuals with mental illness are in the streets and are more likely to be arrested for minor crimes. If adequate housing is available, persons with mental illnesses will have a place to go rather than walking the streets where they could face harm or legal trouble. I think that medication is another important need. If individuals do not have their medication, the behaviors that were ""controlled"" by medication will return and intensify, which can have detrimental physical effects on the individual's chemical balance. "
577," The perception of mental health has shifted from one extreme to the next. Unfortunately, there seems to be a misunderstanding of those with mental illness, especially those with severe mental illness. However, I think that raising awareness, which has come to light more recently, has helped promote persons with a mental illness's self-determination. In previous centuries individuals with mental illness were viewed as individuals who are untreatable, helpless, and victims or causes of their ""disease.""  Thus resulting in society seeing them as incurable and outcasts. When people are treated and discarded, they do become victims of their circumstances, so many did struggle with helplessness and hopelessness. In recent times, people with mental illnesses are more apart of their treatment, which has promoted their self-determination, eliminating some helplessness. It could be because I work in a behavioral health agency, but including clients in their care allows them to be proactive in and with their services. Outpatient services allow individuals with mental illnesses to choose and understand their treatment in comparison to previous centuries that forced treatment upon those with mental illnesses.     Moreover, today's outpatient services provide clients with resources and positive support, which also promotes self-determination.  I think that we still struggle to consider those with mental illness full-fledged members of society, but we are doing better in raising awareness and education. We understand that there isn't a set ""treatment"" and more of managing symptoms. We have learned that those with mental illnesses are not the causes of their illness and understand that out casting them is not a solution. "
578," Hi Briana, How society has treated and thought of individuals with mental illness throughout history was interesting to me. To see that society's perception of individuals with mental illness has gone from shunning to humanistic to heinous treatment is unfortunate. I thought that it was interesting that you mentioned that our society does not consider PWMI as a full-fledged member of the community. I agree that there is still a ""us"" versus ""them"" aspect. Hence NIMBY moved those with mental illnesses away from the general public. However, I do think that we have made strides since then. Although federal support is not entirely there, I do believe society's understanding and acceptance of those with mental illnesses have become more accepting with the advancement of technology and knowledge.  Especially with the amount of education provided that those with a mental illness are least likely to commit homicide and are not violent individuals. I think the best thing we can do is continue to educate and be more mindful of tying specific words to those with a diagnosis."
579," Hi Denise, I could not agree with you more. It is unfortunate that we still hold onto some of false beliefs that date back to the Renaissance period. I made a similar comment regarding self-termination. Currently individuals with mental illness are members of their treatment. They are provided psycho-education by mental health professionals. However, it does come down to the lack of federal funding. In my opinion, at times, it feels as if we are still living in the era of deinstitutionalization. There aren't enough outpatient treatment facilities, and there is not enough money to meet the needs, which results in PWMI ending up in jails. While some individuals are receiving treatment and are ""acclimating"" within society. There is still a considerable portion that is not having their needs met and pushed into the criminal justice system. If those with mental illnesses are not entirely accepted into society, a lot of it has to do with the criminalization of PWMI that continues in our community."
580," A president can be effective by bringing about an end to mental illness stigma by introducing facts that eliminate falsehoods related to mental illness. For example, supplying information regarding how many people have a mental illness, the statistics regarding violence, or lack thereof from individuals living with a mental illness — being mindful of how you speak of those with a mental illness — eliminating the ""them"" versus ""us."" Lastly, continuing to talk about mental illness and having those uncomfortable conversations to ""normalize"" it."
581," Working for a mental health agency, this is, unfortunately, an issue I see daily and become frustrated with. We are non-profit, but our clients need more help, resources, and support than we can provide. A year ago, there was fear from colleagues and client's that services may close due to being in a financial deficit. I recall client's asking to transfer to other agencies to avoid being without services. I think that reducing benefits for mental health care says that policymakers do not view mental illness as a medical illness. I believe that they don't see it worth their time or investment and are stuck in the mindset that symptoms are self-inflicted and able to self-treated."
582," Although I work in behavioral health and alongside a psychiatrist, I am not 100% pro medication. Especially overmedicating individuals is what feel is done to active and former military personnel. The first thing that I would recommend is a more thorough assessment of service members before prescribing drugs. Chris mentioned that he was diagnosed with PTSD from a 30 questionnaire, and to me, that is not enough to warrant heavy narcotics. He also said that he knew of fellow service members who are or were previously addicted to substances. I think that there should be a more thorough analysis or assessment completed to determine the need for a drug that should include previous substance use. I also think that service members should not be overmedicated or even medication while deployed. One because of the side effects associated with many of the drugs and two, deployment already creates a psychological toll. Instead, I think that a psychiatrist or other medical professional should evaluate service members, and instead of medication, service members should receive therapy services while deployed.  As Chris mentioned, he and other vets felt better speaking about their experiences, and providing therapy while deployed could assist. If it is determined that a prescription is needed, only then should one receive it."
583," I do not think that society should be allowed to ""step in"" and mandate treatment for a PWMI that may not acknowledge they are ill. I do, however, believe that medical personnel should be and only under specific circumstances. One circumstance is if the individual is extremely ill, and being this ill could be a life and death situation. Then medical personnel should step in to ensure their wellbeing and safety. If it is not detrimental, then medical providers should recommend treatment. However, individuals should not be forced if they decline medical care. It should be similar to med providers would do for an individual hospitalized who refuses treatment. I also think that medical personnel should step in if it is determined that the drug itself is causing this side effect. As mentioned in the lecture, this can occur with some medications. If this is a side effect from their specific medication, and medical personnel notices a decline in health, they should be able to assist the individual and again recommend treatment."
584,"According to Rush et al. (2005), public attitudes toward people with mental illness seem to become more stigmatizing over the last decade. As we discussed and learned this week, stigmatization has detrimental effects that either promotes more stigma from society and/or self-stigma for those living with a mental illness. I think that the best way to combat stigma is through education on various levels (schools, documentaries, political programs, local news, etc.). While thinking of curriculum for elementary students, I believe the best way to incorporate mental illness is how we introduce other medical issues to children. I think that information should be presented in the capacity of which children can understand and comprehend the information. Slowly students should be introduced to different facts as they become older. Elementary school:  I recall in elementary school being given health pamphlets that were inviting, colorful, and written in easy to understand language which discussed various medical issues. For elementary school children, they should be presented and introduced to mental illness in a similar fashion. The pamphlets can include types of mental illness and misconceptions. Explaining that those with a mental illness are similar to those with physical medical issues and are everyday people. For elementary school students, I think that it is crucial to keep the conversation as open as possible but not over flooding children with information they may not fully understand. Similar to sex education classes, parents should be provided with related information so they can continue to have those types of conversations with their children outside of the classroom.  Middle & High School:  For middle school and high school students, I think that organizations such as NAMI and other behavioral health agencies should come into the schools and present information. For older students, they should be introduced to the historical treatment of persons with mental illness. I think that presenting some of the mistreatment of PWMI will allow for students to feel empathic and more humanistic towards those with a mental illness. Similar to the elementary-aged students, middle and high schoolers should be presented with the fact that those with a mental illness are: not more violent, they do not need to be feared, and that PWMI's are more likely to be victims (Lecture 2.3). I also think that high schoolers should be informed"
585,"Hi Alyse,   While thinking of curriculum for students to combat stigma, I had a similar thought process as you, presenting the essential information and going from there with older students. I think that showing interviews of individuals with mental illness is great. Students will be able to see that those with a mental illness do not look much different. I also think that starting with younger children will reduce stigma in the future because the discussion is being had early on. I believe that mental illness should be discussed as similarly as we speak and teach children about disease, terminal illness, and death; sensitively and openly. You brought up a valid point regarding high school-aged children. By this age, some may have a diagnosis or may be diagnosed in adulthood, and by reducing stigma at that age point, hopefully, those who are diagnosed later in life do not become label avoidant."
586,"Hi Gabby,   For high school students, I think that you bring up a very valid point. Unfortunately, suicide does occur in high schools and could be correlated to undiagnosed mental illnesses. I think it would be beneficial to introduce symptoms and 'red flags"" so students know what to look for in their peers as well as themselves. By reducing stigma, hopefully, more students would be more open to looking and receiving help. Schools should also integrate into their curriculum supports for if students are experiencing a crisis or other mental health issues and questions. It unfortunate how people band together after a tragedy but are still uncomfortable having those difficult conversations."
587," Specificity and sensitivity can be beneficial for decisions about civil commitment if the results are accurate. As discussed in the video, true positives and true negatives are the best results but are rare. In regards to civil commitment, the goal is to reduce the number of false negatives and false positives, and the way to do so is to maximize sensitivity. We want to ensure that if an individual has a mental illness and predicted to have a problem in the future that this is accurate. A positive diagnosis (a false negative and false positive) can be impactful on one's life resulting in an unnecessary sentence, unnecessary treatment, and unnecessary medication. The video mentions that it is unlikely that a test will be specific and sensitive and that it is a trade-off. However, if sensitivity is maximized, we will be able to accurately identify a diagnosis and determine the possibility of future problems thus reducing unnecessary treatment, medication, and sentencing   "
588," I think that involuntary commitment of a sex offender after they complete their sentences is a bad idea. Many sex offenders have served lengthy sentences, and per the video and lecture, it is challenging to predict future behavior and say that a behavior will reoccur for ALL offenders. I agree that involuntary commitment after serving time is a deprivation of one's liberty. Moreover, involuntary commitment is supposed to be therapeutic treatment rather than punitive, but sending someone straight to inpatient services is punitive because you are enforcing them to receive treatment for a past offense. I think that the limited hours of treatment is unfair. Offenders are having treatment 3 hours a week could quickly achieve that through an outpatient treatment facility. Due to the limited amount of therapeutic hours, I think that involuntary commitment is entirely punitive. I believe that there has to be a better solution than involuntary commitment. Possibly an assessment or interview that can determine those who are more likely to offend and based on different levels does that person receive involuntary commitment — or even adding treatment to the prison sentence."
589," I would consider inpatient commitment to be the larger reach of state authority into an individual's liberty. As we watched in the last video regarding SVP's, inpatient commitment is not therapeutic, therapy/treatment times are limited, and you are confined in a similar setting like a prison. With outpatient commitment, although criticized for being corrosive, there is still more freedom available to individuals. As research indicated with outpatient treatment, individuals are more compliant with their medication, are more willing to engage in treatment, and have a better quality of life. With outpatient commitment, individuals are still able to create and have lives outside of their treatment."
590,"    Inpatient Civil Commitment: Inpatient civil commitment is when the state intervenes to treat a person with a mental illness without their consent due to incapacitation of harm to self (Slate et al.,2013 ). The social goals for inpatient civil commitment are that the state provides care and treatment for those who need is, relieves society/families from having to provide care for the individual's needs, society is protected, and it prevents the individual from harming themselves (Lecture 3.2). To be civilly committed there is the ""need for treatment"" standard as well as the following criteria, one must have a mental illness, pose danger to self or others, have a grave disability, incompetent to consents and the least restrictive alternative is not available (Burley & Morris, 2015)(Lecture 3.2). I think that one of the pros related to inpatient civil commitment is that if the individual poses dangerousness towards self or others, they immediately receive care to stop the action from occurring as well as providing care for individuals who are mentally incapacitated and unable to recognize that treatment is needed or unable to afford treatment (Lecture 3.2). However, there are cons to inpatient civil commitment. One of the most significant issues is that it is coercive because patients are deprived of their rights and do not get a say in their treatment or if they want treatment (Slate et al., 2013 ). Another con is that inpatient commitment contributes to false beliefs about those with mental illnesses. As discussed by Slate et al. ( 2013), it adds to the false belief that individuals with mental illnesses are violent and are in need of confined treatment. Lastly, inpatient civil commitment has been criticized for being driven by money rather than providing treatment for those who genuinely need it (Slate et al., 2013). I think that inpatient civil commitment could be successful for individuals if specific adjustments are made to the process. As mentioned, the most significant criticism is that it is coercive I thi"
591,"Just some other things I was thinking about this week:     I think that inpatient civil commitment and outpatient commitment could be successful for individuals if certain adjustments were made to the process. As mentioned, the most significant criticism for inpatient public commitment and outpatient commitment is that it is coercive I think to overcome this once an individual is diagnosed with a debilitating mental illness that a power of attorney is established and that mental incapability due to mental illness is included. This would enforce that someone other than the state is deeming that an individual needs to receive inpatient treatment. Additionally, in regards to inpatient civil commitment, to reduce the stigma associated with inpatient commitment is to complete a questioner that mental health professionals use to determine danger to self or others truly — possibly creating crisis plans if needed rather than immediate inpatient. Lastly, for inpatient civil commitment, I think that the federal government should provide more money to the state for mental health facilities that promote a therapeutic atmosphere that is beneficial and offers true treatment. I think the best way to overcome some of the cons associated with outpatient commitment is not to enforce medication. I believe that a mental health professional should recommend it if needed but allowing for individuals to have the final stay on their needs and wants. If an individual declines medication, then therapy services should be in place as a safety net."
592,"Hi Clara,  I enjoyed the information you presented this week. I agree that we should follow up with individuals when they are released back into society. I would say not even in a short term aspect but long term as well. I think it would be beneficial for the individual to report their own updates in treatment and for there to be changes made to their treatment. For example if they are receiving therapy services there should be updated quarterly to determine their progress towards therapeutic goals and if there are new goals to add. I think that this would help made service feel force and allow for individuals to have more say in their treatment and potentially more involvement in their treatment. Do you think that this would help them with gaining stability as well? or even access to community resources? Do you think that limited funding could make this unsuccessful to accomplish? "
593,"Hi Asia,   I, too, discussed that the first measure of success for both inpatient and outpatient would be to have patients that actually want to be in treatment. I liked your recommendation that educating patients about their mental illness would help them to understand better the necessity of the treatment or even why they are receiving treatment. To add to your suggestion, I think more interactive therapeutic services. In addition to traditional therapy, possibly group therapy to show that there are others with similar struggles and symptoms. Accomplishing this would be tricky, but I think that it would be achievable. I would be interested to know how we would know if treatment was successful and that patients were able to sustain healthy and meaningful relationships. Would this only be during treatment time or long term? "
594,"Hello Dr. Turner,  I have used Zoom only a handful of times but I am very familiar with Power Point. "
595," I think that the most challenging stage of the criminal process for PWMI would be the adjudication stage. I believe that this would be the most difficult because, in this stage, defendants are first read their charges; it is challenging to know if they fully understand the charges against them. Here the defendant may not know whether or not to plead guilty or not guilty and if the case does go to trial the cons and pros of taking a plea bargain as well as the consequences that follow a plea bargain. For PWMI, the trial process itself could be triggering, stressful, and they may not know how to navigate the system properly or comprehend what is occurring."
596,"Some benefits for PWMI with recent changes in California corrections to shift responsibility for large numbers of felons from the state to local jurisdictions includes that further reincarceration may not occur. With Realignment, PWMI may not return to prisons for violations, especially for misdemeanors and petty crimes. Additionally, Prop 47 PWMI, who have non-violent, non-serious drug and property felonies' will have their offenses dropped to a misdemeanor, which results in shorter sentences. Prop 47 also provides the benefit that offenders, including PWMI, can ""clean up"" their prior offenses. With Prop 57 PWMI who do receive a prison time will be able to receive rehabilitation services. The challenge that comes for the changes in California corrections is PWMI may be granted early parole too soon. To clear prisons, PWMI may not receive the benefits of rehabilitation. With Prop 57, PWMI can earn additional credits for participation in programs resulting in early release. However, early release does not guarantee a smooth transition out of the justice system or ensure that recidivism will not occur."
597," I do not think that it is fair that police often serve as first responders to situations involving PWMI. Due to their minimal training in dealing with PWMI, I do not think that they should respond to situations involving PWMI. I think that officers should be accompanied by a trained mental health professional, possibly someone who is a co-liaison that works in the field of mental health and with the department. For officers to respond solely is unfair to them and the individual. Officers are not trained to determine if someone requires hospitalization if they are having an effect due to mediation, if they are experiencing active psychosis or if they are experiencing suicidal ideation. Although officers are able to deescalate situations and training are improving to include the PWMI population, I do not think that they should have to determine steps for the individual once de-escalation has occurred."
598," Based on this week's reading and lecture, CIT is related to stigma because its use reduces stigma and provides more insight into mental illness. For example, the components of training are to identify signs and symptoms of mental illness, introduce the types of psychotropic drugs and their side-effects, discusses de-escalation techniques, and creates interaction with consumers of mental health services. CIT promotes more education regarding PWMI  for officers. One of the benefits of CIT is that it reduces the officer's stigmatizing behaviors towards PWMI. It also lowers arrest rates, which reduces the thought that PWMIs are ""criminals"" or ""violent."" "
599," Taheri (2016) discusses the successes of Crisis Intervention Training, stating, contact with law enforcement may be the only opportunity that PWMIs have to connect with treatment. Crisis Intervention Training CIT's curriculum includes basic information about mental illness, local mental health systems and laws, psychotropic drugs, and their symptoms (Lecture 4.4)(Taheri, 2016). While CIT has shown some benefits which include, lowered arrest rates, reducing officer's stigmatizing PWMI, and officer safety, Taheri (2016) found mixed results regarding the effectiveness of CITs. Taheri (2016) stated that CIT has no effect on the outcome of arrest and increase use of force by CIT officers. However, Taheri (2016) did find that CIT officers transported mentally ill to more community-based services rather than arrest them in comparison to non-CIT officers. I do think that the CIT model can be successful as CIT comes with the benefits of fewer deaths for officers and PWMI, reduction in jail suicides, and shooting of PWMI (Lecture 4.4). What I would suggest based on the Taheri (2016) findings is that there should be yearly training and follow-ups. I do not think that CIT should be a ""one and done"" training. With more research presented about PWMI and information regarding psychotropic drugs, there should be new training with new information yearly. In addition to yearly trainings, Taheri (2016) mentioned that officers are introduced to ""basic information of mental illness."" I think that there should be more education/training about the different mental illnesses and the symptoms associated with it. Moreover, I think that officers should have some CIT background but that there should be a specific unit that responds to calls for PWMI, as discussed by Ruiz (1993). If there is a specific unit that dispatches, the preparation of the call for officers can occur, and they can triage the situation accordingly. Lastly, Taheri (2016) mentioned that there is a lack of communication between mental health agencies and law enforcement. I think that a mental health specialist should be apart of the CIT law enforcement team where they can respond to calls with officers to also provide support to the individual with mental illness and the officers. If a mental health professional is included, they may be able to assist where CIT officers fall short possibil"
600,"Hi Amber,   Great post! You brought up an excellent point and one I failed to consider regarding officers responding to the same location or about the same individual on multiple occasions. You are absolutely correct that this would result in CIT being ineffective. I agree that the use of the CIT model should be implemented for longer than 60 days. I made a similar comment that there should be yearly training/follow-ups because of the change in behaviors over a period of time. Like you mentioned, PWMI require specialized attention and treatment that the criminal justice system fails to provide. I found it interesting that different states and cities had mixed results and wondered how one state could have successful outcomes where others do not. Your post made me wonder how the justice system can provide consistency in their teachings/training across the country.       "
601,"Reflecting on the video, I think that it would be incredibly frustrating to be a mentally ill person who has been arrested and jailed more than 100 times. As discussed in the lecture, jails are notoriously underfunded and only fulfill basic needs. Because of this, those with mental illness receive limited treatment (typically just medication) and then released. As mentioned, persons with mental illness are released back onto the streets with a bag full of pills and no plan. This only induces ""sickness"" (PWMI going on and off medication) as many will probably not see outpatient treatment (or know how to) and creates the revolving door. Not to mention the inconsistency with treatment where some receive treatment where others do not. For a PWMI in jail and who has been jailed over 100 times, I would feel hopeless, that treatment and stability may not ever happen."
602,"The three key indicators I feel jails should measure about mental illness include (1) co-morbidities / how many diagnoses a person has. I think that this is an essential indicator for jails to look at because it can determine how individuals can be treated and provide possible insight into their past and current, as well as, future behaviors the individual may experience while in jail. (2) present/active symptoms this could help to determine if a person is currently in crisis to triage the situation and deescalate them. (3) how long the individual has been with or without medication to ensure that they are evaluated as soon as possible to receive treatment and for a social worker to assist with what will occur once their jail sentence is over (if outpatient services are needed or follow up by psychiatrist if convicted and placed in a prison)."
603,"This was a difficult question for me to answer. I honestly feel that jail inmates are given the appropriate amount of rights. Inmates have the right to freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of expression, the right to health care, and right of due process. While some may be awaiting trial, they are still there for a crime committed, and while some offenses are less severe than others, there needs to be consistency for all inmates. The rights awarded to jail inmates are based on the 1st, 5th, 8th, and 14 Amendments. However, if I have to choose, I would say that jail inmates are given too many rights. I made this decision based on the fact that inmates are able to refuse treatment. Although this is controversial, I think that inmates should have to have an adversarial hearing before a judge and for the judge to make this determination. I believe that this is extremely important especially for those who have a mental illness because, for many, this may be the only place they receive treatment."
604," I think that the most common form of treatment for persons with mental illness is medication because it is a ""quick fix."" After an individual is on psychotropic medication for some time their mood begins to stabilize in comparison to providing therapy and coping skills that take months or even years to master. Since jail sentences are typically less than a year, jails may want to ensure stability of an individual quickly.  I also think that medication is used because it can subdue behaviors rapidly and reduce the risk of danger to self and others. Lastly, I believe that medication is used because of the limited amount of funding that jails receive. Jails cannot afford to pay for mental health professionals to be there around the clock to provide therapy. "
605," According to Torrey et al. (2010), there are more than three times more seriously mentally ill persons in jail than there are in hospitals. An estimated 630,000 people are incarcerated in the US, and at least 16% of inmates in jails and prisons have a severe mental illness, and 40% of individuals with serious mental illness have been in jail or prisons at some time (lecture 5.1) (Torret et al., 2010). County jails are known for being underfunded and understaffed in comparison to prisons that are more generously funded (lecture 5.1). Based on the information and reading from this week, I think that jails do the best they can, given the amount of funding they receive for seriously mentally ill inmates. I would not say that jails are most appropriate setting for the seriously mentally ill, but they are appropriate given the limited funds, architectural, and operational constraints. With Ruiz v. Estelle, seriously mentally ill, inmates received appropriate treatment/rights such as being screened and evaluated for mental illness, assessment of mental health treatment, trained mental health professionals to treat mentally ill inmates, and appropriate use of behavioral altering medication (Slate et al., 2013). Additionally, The Consensus Project recommends that jails should have the capacity to provide immediate crisis intervention as well as short term treatment (Slate et al., 2013). Jails have attempted to assist seriously mentally ill inmates with crises, reducing isolation, providing staff observations/monitoring and telepsychiatry with the limited amount of funds they do have (Slate et al., 2013) However, jails are essentially inappropriate for the seriously mentally ill. Torrey et al. (2010) stated that jails are not structurally appropriate for those with mental illness. According to Slate et al. (2013), individuals with mental illness spend longer periods in jail, and those with severe mental illness may be particularly sensitive to excessive sensory stimuli. Additionally, inmates with severe mental illness have major management problems with rates of disciplinary infractions (Slate et al., 2013). Most importantly, jails have limited mental health services. While Ruiz v. Estelle was to ensure screening, appropriate medication, suicide prevention, and treatment, few jails are (especially smaller jails) are equipped to provide comp"
606," Hi Karen, I cannot agree more about the negative effects realignment has for jails. While realignment helped the prisons, it hurt the jail system and intensifies the revolving door. I like how you stated that due to realignment, jails are an inappropriate practice in the context of funding, architectural, and operational constraints. I think that if there was more funding to jail then and PWMI's mental health and physical health needs were met, it may be a different story, but I do not think that the state thoroughly thought out the negative consequences associated with realignment. I agree that those who commit a crime should serve time but what are your thoughts about  referring a seriously mentally ill inmate  out to a treatment facility until trial?"
607," Hi Suze,      You made a very excellent point! Jails are not only inappropriate for those with mental illness, but they are also unsuitable for the inmates that are not mentally ill as they are not structurally built to house the inmates placed within them after realignment - they lack the capacity and space. Even if more funding was available and more staff members were in jails, jails are not large enough to house everyone. I made a similar comment in my post that realignment induces poor care in jails. Because there are so many individuals in jails with limited staff, this could result in staff giving the severely mentally ill medication and over-medicating them to manage everyone. More inmates but limited funding lead to only basic needs being met for the PWMI population. Although realignment reduces the prison population, it only creates a perpetual cycle for PWMI in jails and increases recidivism.  "
608,"I do think that it is fair to use risk assessment tools although they are not 100% accurate. As Jesse Sorkness discussed in the video the CJ system is ""outcome focused"". Risk assessment can help in determining the success an individual may have in the future and work to prevent/reduce recidivism. I think that there can be improvements to risk assessments and information is always changing so I would hope that they would be come more accurate than they currently are. However, people differ from one another and I think that there will never be a risk assessment tool that is 100% accurate. Risk assessment tools are truly just tools. They are not meant to give a hard stance on the individual and possible future crimes. I think that they are better used to determine the appropriate services one needs to prevent recidivism. "
609,"I think that mental health professionals would be in support of the RNR approach with PWMI in the justice system. Compared to other ""treatments"" we have discussed the RNR model does take into account the individuals criminogenic needs and helps to provide services and treatment that are consistent that are created specifically for the offenders.  The RNR model focuses on the higher risk offenders so other factors I think they should be concerned about it diagnosis, treatment history, medication (if they are currently on medication), medication side effects/are they stable on medication and history of prior CJ system involvement. "
610," I do not think that probation is set up well to address supervision and treatment of PWMI. As discussed in the text, most probation officers are not adequately skilled to deal with persons with mental illness in terms of community supervision. The video states that that 400,000 people in the state of California are under probation, indicating that caseloads for probation officers are high. For probation officers to have high caseloads plus individuals with mental illness could mean that they are not receiving the necessary supervision they need. Individuals with mental illness need more accessibility from their probation officers. However, I support the idea of caseloads specifically for PWMI. I think that probation could be successful in the supervision and treatment of PWMI if probation officers were more equipped in dealing with PWMI and had fewer probationers to supervise. In comparison to jails, I think that probation is a better alternative since probation officers set up probationers with resources, and their conditions of probation are explicitly created for them. In jails, the individual may not even receive treatment, but with probation, they have accessibility to community mental health services and are held accountable for participating in services."
611,"If I had to participate in a mental health court, I would feel relieved. As we learned so far throughout the quarter, PWMI do not receive the treatment they desperately need either through outpatient services or in jails/prisons. I prefer a mental health court over a traditional court because mental health courts do not focus on crime and punishment but rather treatment. Mental health courts focus on individualized treatment plans for the individual and give mandates treatment/services they may not otherwise receive or have access to. Mental health courts are effective because participants receive support, such as housing, medication, caseworkers, etc that allow them to be held accountable but also receive various assistance. If I had to participate in a mental health court I would feel that there is an opportunity and freedom available to me that can assist me on various levels reducing the ""revolving door"". "
612," Skeem et al. (2015) discuss that approximately two million admissions into U.S. jails are persons with mental illness, with 75-80% of them having co-occurring substance use disorders. Policymakers have attempted to reduce recidivism rates by implementing the Risk-Need-Responsivity model (RNR). Skeem et al. (2015) described the RNR model as a that focuses directly on public safety goals such as reduced recidivism, jail days, and criminal justice cost. Overall, RNR's goal is to reduce symptoms for PWMI and improve functioning (Skeem et al., 2015). The main components of RNR are to focus on higher-risk offenders, focusing on the offenders' criminogenic needs and providing services and treatment that is consistent (lecture 6.1). RNR has been widely adopted because of the main components. However, Skeem et al. (2015) state that acceptance of this model should occur with caution as there is a limited about of empirical support for the model and its beliefs. According to Slate et al. (2013), most probation officers are not adequately skilled to deal with persons with mental illness who are released into the community on probation. However, probation is the most common form of sentencing in the US since correctional services delivered in the community come at a lower cost and is more effective in reducing recidivism (Skeem et al. 2013). Many agencies across the country have implemented specialized probation programs for individuals with mental illness (Slate et al., 2013). I would recommend to the Chief Probation Officer similar principles of these specialized probation programs or a hybrid approach similar to what Skeem et al. (2015) discuss. I would first recommend that there be specialized probation officers who are familiar with mental illnesses and have a background in understanding mental health symptoms, medication and medication symptoms, and how to engage with PWMI appropriately. In addition to specialized probation officers, I would recommend that specialized probation officers receive limited caseloads of PWMI. With limited caseloads and specialized training, probation officers can assist probationer and ensure they are compliant with the terms of their probation but also allows for probation officers to help probationers be proactive about their probation acting as additional support and resource. I think that limited cases would help probationers and specialized probation"
613," Hi Cornise,  I liked how you mentioned the comparison between jails/prions versus probation and how prison does not necessarily change behavior to add to that statement I would also add that with jail and/or prison treatment is not a grantee due to funding. I agree that there needs to be extensive training for probation officers, specialized probation officers, and those who are working with even low-level offenders. I think that if there is more training and use, there can be more empirical research done and can indicate the true success of it."
614," Hi Wendy, I think that you brought forth a fascinating perspective of merging programs such as CBT programs with the RNR model. I agree that there does not need to be empirical evidence to support its effectiveness, and to add to that, CBT has empirical evidence to support it, so it is not necessary. A merging CBT with RNR allows for more treatment to be provided and, as you mentioned, an opportunity for mental stability for PWMI. I think to reduce PWMI's interaction with law enforcement and reduce recidivism needs need to be met, physical and sociological needs, something that merging CBT can provide."
615,"I think that prison can aggravate the conditions of persons with mental illness because it can be sensory overload or not enough stimuli to keep their symptoms at ease. For a person with mental illness, the loud noises of other prisoners or behaviors of other prisoners can be overwhelming. They individual may already struggle with anxiety or schizophrenia, and their symptoms could worsen. Also, four walls to stare at or solitary confinement can cause an individual with a mental illness (depression or bipolar disorder) to feel lost, underwhelmed, hopeless, and helpless. I think that prions and correctional officers do not understand symptoms associated with mental illness and in return, continue punitive punishments."
616," No, I do not think that it is possible to ever truly rehabilitate prisoners with mental illness. Mental illness and symptoms associated with mental illness never truly ""go away."" The symptoms become more manageable with medication and therapy services, but they are still there with the individual. The issue also becomes that some prisoners with mental illness will decline medication, so their symptoms never stabilize, or once they are released, they are non-compliant with medication services. I agree with the video that prison brings on various symptoms/ mental illness at the beginning of an individual's sentence because of the transition. Then stress eases off, but at release, the next transition, the individual will again experience symptoms."
617,"This is difficult to answer as I see the necessity of solitary confinement. If an inmate is deemed a threat to security or the safety of others, they will be placed in solitary confinement for up to 23 hours at a time. Solitary confinement can ensure the individual's safety, worker's safety, and peers' safety. However, I do not think that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. As we learned in previous weeks, solitary confinement can exacerbate symptoms related to an individual's mental illness and intensify feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, and depressive symptoms when individuals are placed in solitary confinement the likelihood of suicide increases. The video discusses how the individual begins to feel aggression and wanted to seek revenge for being left alone. I think that solitary confinement does more harm than good. It may temporarily assist workers, but it can be detrimental to the offender in confinement."
618," I feel disappointed about how our tax dollars are currently being spent on treating mentally ill inmates. The video discusses how inmates require mental health services; however, many are not receiving the treatment they need. Based on the video, If my tax dollars were spent to help with the classification of inmates to place them in specialized facilities similar to the stat of Illinois, I think that this would be an incredible change in how PWMI are treated within prisons. I would be in support of my tax dollars going into revamping old buildings, hiring appropriate staff (possibly mental health professionals), and more therapeutic treatment for PWMI. I do agree that we could save money by providing community based treatment however, I feel that it is vital that PWMI inmates still receive treatment. As discussed in previous videos many PWMI receive treatment for the first time in prison. If treatment is taken care of in prisons this may reduce the recidivism rate. In all I just do not think that there is enough money to go around for community services and prison services. "
619," Approximately 7.1 million people are under the supervision of adult correctional authorities in the U.S. I 2010 (Slate et al., 2013). Between 15% to 30% of prisoners are taking medication or on medication ad the time of arrest for various mental disorders (lecture 7.2). Adams and Ferrandion (2008) stated that there is a serious disjuncture between treatment and needs of the offenders and the resources available for treatment; thus, there is a resource gap between has a substantial effect on administrative handling of the mentally ill. Slate et al. (2013) made a similar statement that while prisons, jails, and administrations are working to improve treatment of inmates, correctional executives continue to struggle to balance the demands of maintaining security with treatment needs of PWMI in an institutional setting. One of the biggest issues with PWMI in institutional settings is that they get sicker, stay longer, suffer more and wind up back in prison after release (Ball, 2010). I think that prisons can best meet the need to keeping inmates and staff safe, provide needed treatment for those suffering from mental illness while containing cost by extending their allotted for services for PWMI. Slate et al. (2013) stated that millions of dollars had been spent to build new prisons, but spending on treatment has been lacking. It is estimated that the cost of severe mental illness is $317, billion-plus the cost of incarceration (Slate et al., 2013). The state of California received 8 million dollars in funding in 2015 (Vera, 2019). I think that correctional executives should priorities the needs of PWMI first and use the remaining funds for non-PWMI prisoners. The first thing that prisons can do to best meet the need to keep inmates and staff safe is to provide separate hosing for intimates accurately screened as having a mental illness. PWMI housing should not be supermax confinement but rather an environment that they can thrive in because they receive more support. Slate et at (2013) discussed specialized housing units that provide residential treatment and supportive living units. I think that this is the most important because PWMI is more likely to experience disciplinary rates/actions, be victims of abuse (physical and/or sexual) higher rates of suicide and self-injurious behaviors (Slate et al, 2013). Additionally, Carr et al. (2006) stated that integrating mentally ill in"
620," Hi Clara, I enjoyed reading your post. I agree PWMI should receive more resources simply because they are the most in need of it. You brought up a very important point. PWMI, who are not psychologically assessed and treated with therapy or necessary medication, can become agitated and aggressive in jail, which ultimately creates a danger to the inmate, staff, and other inmates. Like you mentioned, and Slate et al. (2013) stated that limited staffing due to budgets and/or heavy workloads for behavioral health professionals, may lead to PWMI being screened improperly. I made a similar statement that budgets should focus on ensuring that necessary employees are hired so this does not occur. However, a thought I had for myself when I made this statement is whether more staff member would really change anything. Behavioral health professionals experience high rates of burn out how do you think prisons can ensure that employees stay?"
621," Hi Amber,  I think you made an essential point, ""no matter how expensive"" treatment is necessary for PWMI. As I wrote this week's post, I reflected on one of the lecture videos that discussed our tax dollars. I would not be upset if taxes were raised if it were to support treatment for incarcerated PWMI. I would be interested to know if the general public would. I do not think that we can put a price on treatment, stability, and safety, so I think you made an excellent point there."
622,"I would feel good about the construction of the new Fulton State Hospital because the new layout that will be safer for patients and more conducive to treatment. One of the issues in the past regarding state hospitals is that the physical layouts are not conducive to treatment. The photos of the new facility do not look prison like structures but housing units. Similar to what Nixon stated in the video, they have learned from the past and ready to have new humane and effective treatments so I would be in support for the new updated facility. "
623,"This is difficult for me, I would say yes and no.  ""Not guilty by reason of insanity""   is and  is not a get out of jail free card. If an individual is deemed not guilty by reason of insanity the individual will still be sent to a state hospital where they stay for a period equal to the maximum sentence of most serious offense. Although not jail the individual is not ""free"" to be a member in the community however they are not confined to the restrictions of jail/prison. "
624,"I would say that state hospital can best deal with patients and staff safety while providing treatment by ensuring that staff members are properly trained in crisis intervention techniques. Sate hospitals can provide defensive training that will protect staff members and patients. Many crisis intervention training teach staff members how to protect themselves without causing harm to patients which could be beneficial. I would also recommend more security staff that can step in to assist an individual in danger or that can deescalate the situation. I think that security is the most important as more security  can ensure that outside drugs are not brought into the center and that those who may try to harm themselves are watched. Additionally, more staff in general is needed in state hospitals. As discussed in the previous lectures many state hospitals lack enough staff members. There should be more trained professionals in state hospitals that can assist with watching patients and assisting other workers. "
625," I am not against doctors using deep brain stimulation as a treatment for depression, especially for individuals whose depressive symptoms have become so debilitating even with various forms of treatment. I would say that it should not be the first type of treatment one receives but rather the last option if nothing else has been successful since it is a risky surgery. I think that if there is something to alleviate the pain for those with severe depression that it should be explored and an option available to them. "
626," Fisher et al. (2009) stated that during the first half of the 20th-century state, hospitals were the primary locus of care for those in need of long-term care and treatment suffering from mental illness. Currently, state hospitals are known for managing populations deemed inappropriate for other settings (Fisher et al., 2009). I think that the most appropriate role for state hospitals in relation to the criminal justice system is to hold individuals who have been declared incompetent to stand trial or to hold individuals who have been deemed not guilty by reason of insanity (lecture 8.2). I think the most appropriate role of state hospitals is to ensure that the individual does become ""restored"" to competency and/or receives the necessary treatment while hospitalized (lecture 8.2). Currently, 90% of the Department of State Hospitals population is forensic patients (lecture 8.2). Fisher et al. (2009) define forensic patients as those who are committed by the criminal courts because their competency to stand trial has been questioned; they have been found incompetent. They have not regained competency, or they were adjudicated as not guilty by reason of insanity. It is difficult to say that state hospitals should be used exclusively for forensic patients. I do see the possible benefits associated with state hospitals only having forensic patients. As it could alleviate overcrowding, allow staff to treat and manage patients appropriately, and it may even allow for specialty treatment for forensic patients with the use of consolidated hospitals (Fisher et al., 2009). However, without state hospitals, I think that we would see more PWMI being swept into the criminal justice system continue, and there are still populations that are in need of the structure state hospitals provide, such as 24-hour care (lecture 8.1). I would say no; state hospitals should not be used almost exclusively for forensic patients; instead, it should be used for forensic patients and the small minority that needs 24-hour care. This weeks' lecture stated that for the small minority, if they do not receive the structure of a state hospital, this could lead to these PWMI to lead chaotic and dysphoric lives in the community, thus increasing homelessness and incarceration (lecture 8.1). If money were not a factor I would be in support of consolidating hospital populations, those with a serious mental illness tha"
627,"clarification: I said,   I would say no; state hospitals should not be used almost exclusively for forensic patients; instead, it should be used for forensic patients and the small minority that needs 24-hour care.  but I meant to say, yes, state hospitals should be used almost exclusively for forensic patient in additional the the smiall minority that needs 24-hour care. "
628,"Hi Asia,  I had a similar thought that you mentioned. Currently California state hospitals are comprised almost exclusively for forensic patient so implementing this policy would not change for the state of California. I agree that although many state hospitals are old, prison like structures it is a better alternative than a person with mental illness being place in jails or prisons. As we discussed in previous weeks PWMIs in jails/prisons experience more maltreatment, abuse and neglect. "
629,"Hi Stephanie,  I enjoyed reading your post. While answering this question I was going back and forth on what state hospitals roles should be. I have to agree with you, the most important and appropriate role is just to be an alternative place for treatment especially considering that state hospitals are well equipped for caring/treating very disturbed patients and state hospitals are  supportive enviroment which in itself is therapeutic. Another difference is that state hospital staff are more understanding and knowledgeable to symptoms related to major depressive disorder, bipolar, schizophrenia and schizoaffective which could reduce PWMI from feeling isolated, hopeless and helpless. "
630," No, I do not think that the described forms of data sharing are satisfactory for really understanding the link between CJ and MH systems and their clients. As discussed in the video, there is a lapse that occurs, and each party is not properly notified. To improve this link, I think that clients should sign a release of information at the first opportunity, either their first arrest or intake for MH services. This release can only indicate that they are receiving or sought treatment of previously incarcerated but does not divulge in-depth information out treatment or past histories of substance use. This can ensure that the opposing party can be notified in a database as soon as possible."
631,I think that the CIT trained approach appears more calming and less confrontational. The CIT trained officer came in stating that he was there to help the individual. I like how they just asked general questions initially about his medication to ensure he is safe or if he did take more than his needed dosage what to prepare for medically. I also liked how they had him walk through his concerns that are upsetting him and showing him that there are solutions to help him.  It seemed more liked they cared about him and his wellbeing. 
632,I think that if often take a court order or other legal actions for departments of corrections to change the way PWMI are treated because there is push back and different ideas/trainings on how or what is the proper way to care for PWMI. I also think that lack of staff is an issue as there may be more turnover which means limited trainings or knowledge for officers.
633,"I think that mental health workers might have to deal with in a correctional enviroment is possibly pushback from prisoners. As discussed in the video, there are some prisoners who can tell when someone is disingenuous and that they are used to being reminded of the past actions and not use to someone caring about helping them. I think that for correctional authorities they may not be familiar with mental health service and what occurs in treatment. As discussed in previous lectures they may not understand symptoms of mental illness or medication side effects. On the other side, MH professionals may not be familiar with correctional proceedings. I think  that cross training bridges that gap and keeps both parties informed to better assist inmates. Ensuring that they are able to recieve appropriate treatment. "
634," I think that overall the most essential training for mental health and criminal justice is actors is to know what each other's role is. Trainings can occur yearly and remind both parties what each other's role is, what one another offers, and who to communicate with. I think that there should be more communication between the two, and this type of training will bridge the existing gap. Watson and Fulambaker (2012) stated that they found that mental health professionals and law enforcement officers did not trust one another, although they often rely on one another for assistance. I think that if law enforcement/criminal justice actors understood mental illness, symptoms, response options, and conducted on scene assessments, this will promote with knowledge and confidence to support offenders without punitive action (lecture 9.2). CIT training, in my opinion, is the most appropriate because it encompasses the understanding of mental illness and how to appropriately care and deescalate PWMI. Parker (2006) stated that correctional officers can play a vital role in ensuring appropriate treatment of offenders with mental illness but that they receive little training in mental health issues. As discussed in previous weeks, those in the CJ system are unfamiliar with mental illness and how to appropriately interact and care for PWMI. Training includes information on signs and symptoms of mental illness, mental health treatment, co-occurring disorders, legal issues, and de-escalation techniques (Watson, Fulambaker, 2012). Additionally, I think that CIT training is essential is because one of the core elements of the model is collaboration with community partners (mental health providers) (Watson & Fulambaker, 2012). I think that it would be beneficial for MH professionals to receive similar training to CIT that encompasses all they need to know about the CJ system (understanding attorney, officers, probation, and correctional officers' role as well as jail/correctional classification procedures) (lecture 9.4). If the CJ actors and MH professionals received this type of training, I think that it would allow reduce PWMI being victims of the revolving door and ensuring that they receive treatment as soon as they encounter the MH or CJ system."
635,"Hi Caroline,   I enjoyed reading your post and could not agree more that the two systems need one another. People with mental illness are vulnerable populations and require assistance and intervention as soon as possible. I think that we are on our way to mending the gap between the two systems but still have a way to go. You discussed specialized teams, and I think that if more agencies implemented a co-location individual who works for both systems, we could see the gap close. I was curious though what your thoughts are about shared information. I think that this would be the most significant barrier in mending the gap. What do you think either system can do to communicate effectively without breaching personal information?"
636,"Hi Amber, I agree CIT training is the essential training for mental health and criminal justice actors. As you mentioned, the best way to assist PWMI is to have all major parties be interactive with one another, which is the foundation of CIT training. I struggled with finding the essential training for mental health professionals. I am curious about what training you think is essential for them to improve the link with the appropriate and necessary parties. I think that CIT is an all-encompassing training for those in the criminal justice field, but I think that the mental health field also has a lot to learn and understand about the legal system/structure."
637,"I think that diversion programs focuses on non-violent offenders because they pose a low risk as the Fairfax program first sends non-violent PWMI to treatment rather than prison. In my opinion it is the least restive method for those who are non-violent and do not pose as big of a threat or a risk. I could also be that non-violent offenders may be more compliant with services/treatment in comparison to violent offenders. I think that violent offenders should still be offered the oppurtunity to participate in diversion programs if they want to participate in treatment. I think that non-violent offenders could have an ""interview"" that assess their risk since I think that diversion programs are err on the side of caution. Like one of the officers mentioned, any inmate should be screened to determine eligibility and I think that this should include all offenders with a mental illness.   "
638,"I think that the hurdles are different for criminal justice and mental health agencies to implement evidence based practices. I think that many mental health agencies are familiar with evidence based practices and do implement them into their treatment models. I would think that mental health agencies would have an easier time incorporating evidence based treatment because they have access to be ""on top"" of the current research. I think that it would be more difficult for the CJ system because their focus is not always on treatment but rather on public safety so they may not be as up to date on current evidence based research or practices. I also think that it would be more difficult for the CJ system because it is very structed and changing their daily practices and functioning may be more difficult to manage and ensure that everyone is on the same page.  "
639,"I think that an integrated MH and Substance Abuse model like the one discussed in the video would help the justice system with their own understandings and raise awareness of mental disorders and the effective and symptoms of a co-occurring disorder. I think that it would also benefit the justice system because they can see what the treatment process is for client's with co-occurring disorders and feel comfortable interacting with them and how to appropriately interact with them. I think that it is also a safety net ensuring that individuals do not get lost in the system and that both groups, mental health and the justice system are there to help and support the individual "
640," I think that peer mentoring is helpful in addressing stigma of mental illness because it allows for those with mental illness to not feel isolated and alone, that someone else knows and can emphasize what the other is feeling and experiencing. I think that it also allows the opportunity for the peer to hold the other accountable in completing tasks, helping one another identify their feelings and how to manage them appropriately as well as keeping one another uplifted and motivated. "
641," I think that the full implementation of the recommendations discussed in the American College of Physicians Position Paper would positively affect the involvement, identification, and outcomes of the mentally ill in the CJ system. Crowely et al. (2015) recommended that there should be better integration of behavioral health into the primary care setting. I think that better integration of behavioral health into the primary care setting creates its own sequential intercept funnel where those with mental illness can be caught before facing incarceration or any interaction with the CJ system. Crowely et al. (2015) stated that for many people with behavioral health concerns, their first point of contact is their primary care physician. An estimated 32% of undiagnosed adults likely turn to their primary care physician to help with mental health issues as opposed to 4% who would turn to a mental health professional. With integrated services (mental health and primary care), individuals with mental illnesses could be caught sooner. Integrated health services also offer the opportunity for individuals to receive treatment sooner. Crowely et al. (2015) stated that literature shows opportunities in the primary care setting to address not only behavioral health but also its server as a platform to promote and prevent at-risk populations. Additionally, integrating behavioral health and primary care can help reduce symptoms related to mental illness. Crowely et al. (2015) recommended that policymakers, insurance payers, primary care, and behavioral health care professionals work to remove payment barriers that impede behavioral health and primary care integration because integrating behavioral health and primary care leads to improved mental health. If more individuals have access to both services as a ""one-stop shop,"" they can reduce the occurrence of symptoms related to the three serious mental disorders (schizophrenia, mania, and major depression)(Munetz & Teller, 2004). As we have discussed in previous weeks many law enforcement official, do not know how to appropriately respond to PWMI. While integrated health service may not stop PWMIs interaction with the CJ system integrated health services may help to reduce the number of PWMIs interaction with the CJ system because they are ""stable"" and receiving treatment. <p style=""margin:"
642,"Hi Elise,   I could not agree with your opinion more. I agree that integrating behavioral health and primary care would act as a safety net and reduce assessments needed before incarceration as well as promote positive coping skills/treatment that may reduce those with mental illness's interaction with the CJ system. I agree with the authors that the benefits associated with integrating services could impact the lives of many. However, why do you think that there is pushback for integrating the two disciplines?"
643,"Hi Caroline,   I agree with your position; the type of care patients receive should be our top priority to help decrease recidivism within both systems to reduce the revolving door. You also stated that there should be a reduction of medication use and while I couldn't agree more, what is your opinion about prescribers that feel that medication with therapeutic treatment being the most beneficial for individuals? Many therapists believe that medication with therapy services is the best practice in ensuring stability."
644,"Non-medical considerations have driven the revolution of treatment and care for people with mental illness by opening up need ideas and methods on how to treat mental health issues. Hippocrates tried to “cure” symptoms of mental illness, which had physical symptoms, by conducting surgery on patients. This opened up doors nowadays by proving that some mental illness symptoms/conditions have a physical role on the body, not just mental. It progressed over the years by proving that the symptoms in our head play a huge role on the rest of our body, inside and outside of it. The ancient Greeks and Romans were cautious when it came to treating people with mental illness, showing that over time that we should treat people with mental illness very carefully because we don’t know what is going on inside of their head exactly. This issue is huge issue for people with schizophrenia (seeing things that aren’t always there.) Foucault thought that economic and cultural factors were associated with mental illness, and with plenty of research studies done now, we know this is true. How those who are financially struggling are more likely to suffer from depression or how some cultures don’t allow their children to seek psychiatric help because they don’t believe they should talk to strangers about their problems, forcing the children to hold it in, by the stigma their ancestor believed in."
645,"In terms of gun violence, I do not think we need a national registry of mentally ill people because I don’t think it will reduce gun violence. If only 4% of mentally ill people are likely to become violent, then we shouldn’t be targeting them. I do believe that we should have a registry of all mentally ill people in general, so we can have it for research or for emergencies. For example, if someone with schizophrenia goes missing we can easily put an amber alert out for them with detail and a picture, immediately, and where they are most likely to go and do. I also, think that if they are the family they are living with has a weapon/gun then that should be on the account as well, but not specifically targeting that factor. I do not think there should be a separate registry for guns in regards to mentally ill people."
646,"Awareness, 1 in 5 people have a mental illness at one point in their life, but they aren’t always public about it to their family or friends. If we break the stigma that mental illness is deemed a “bad” thing then we would be more open to talking about it on a worldwide scale. People would feel more comfortable opening up about the problems they are facing and surprisingly will notice that it is not just them and that what they are feeling is normal. If we break that stigma, we will be able to help/treat more PWMI. We can educate more people with what mental illness really is, and how to finds signs of someone who is starting to show symptoms of a mental illness. We also will be able to provide resources and material for people who have a mental illness or know someone with a mental illness. We need to break the stigma that a mental illness is something to be hidden and ashamed of, and rather something we need to embrace as reality.2"
647,"People who have been diagnosed with a mental illness have been viewed as “outcasts” throughout the centuries. In my opinion, logistically, they have been deemed as not equal people who should be treated as untouchables.  People with mental illness are being wrongfully categorized, under the criminal justice system, therefore, portraying them as dangerous people. Once someone is labeled dangerous it is extremely difficult to change the public opinion of them. Throughout the centuries, society's views of people with a mental illness have mostly stayed the same, and nothing drastic has happened to change that stigma. Different cultures and eras have viewed people with a mental illness in their own context, especially areas with low socioeconomic problems. Cultures and families with less money did not have the means to take care of themselves physically and especially mentally. Back when mental health issues were not covered by insurance, getting mental health help was a luxury. Therefore, those who could afford it were treated/helped, and those who could not be stuck dealing with their mental illness and struggling even more. This is a huge setback for mentally ill people who are trying to create self-determination and consider themselves full-fledged members of society. Why is society only helping those who can afford it, creating an economic problem for those who need help but can’t afford it?  There will always be a debate about mental illness and what symptoms are from physical issues or if their mental illness is creating physical illness. For example, major depressive disorder mental symptoms are feeling extreme lows, but physically it can be seen as fatigue or sleep deprivation. In the past, around fifty years ago, mental illnesses were not considered diseases they were considered political parties’ disapprovals (Szasz, 2011). If society did not agree with something, they then labeled it a “mental illness” for example being gay back then was a mental illness, because it was looked down upon. Now, those stigmas have been turned around by physicians, claiming that mental health and physical health are one. The brain can be damaged or impaired just as much as a heart or leg. In the judicial system, when someone is characterized as mentally ill, officials have to determine if they are a threat to themselves or others, and if they are released, will they continue to be a threat (Farreras, 2019)? The problem with the judicial syste"
648,"Elise,             Agreed, social norms are sadly the stigma that has been and still is associated with mental illness and care. Researching old social norms and how they have progressed and changed throughout time made me think of the Salem Witch Trials. Back in 1648, women were thought of as witches if they were able to do math or were unable to conceive a baby, but if someone in the 1950’s wanted to date someone of the same sex was thought of as mentally ill. Social norms fluctuate over time, and sadly we don’t know where mental illness will be in the next 100 years, but it does seem that we are on the right track. Society is starting to socially accept mental illness and talking about it more publicly. People share their stories and are more open to express how they feel and come to terms that they need help. Do you think there should be segregation of mentally ill people and society? Also, do you think there should be segregation between the mentally ill and jails (meaning no more psych wards in jails/prisons)? I think mental illness is becoming more acceptable to talk about, especially with all the platforms we have now and social media, spreading it faster than ever creating a healthy relationship for mentally ill people and full-fledged members of society.    References Beckmann, L. (2019). 17 Signs That You'd Qualify as a Witch in 1692. Mentalfloss.com."
649,"Steve-                   When you stated “the dispatcher is sending two units to a complaint in which the reporting party wants a man and a woman living in an RV moved from his street.  They have done nothing wrong.  He just wants them ""moved along,"" it reminds me of the mentally ill trying to reintegrate and society agrees that they should be treated the same and reintegrate with a community, but all of them stated “not in my community” or “not in my neighborhood.” People want to accept the fact that the mentally ill is a norm in itself and they should be treated as so. How are they going to be full-fledged members of society if they aren’t a part of society? If people want them to be socially normal, they need to treat them as if they are socially normal, because they are. I think that a lot of societies homeless people have a mental illness because of our health care system. People in the low end of the socioeconomic system can’t afford health insurance, therefore aren’t allowed treatment for mental illnesses. If we accept the fact that mental illness is equivalent to physical illness, then why do we have places where homeless or poor people can walk into and get physical treatment, but we don’t have the same for mental illness? We need to create a place where mental illness can be treated/addressed when walked in to. For example, a free clinic with therapists, supplies, and resources."
650,"Shayda- I like/agree with you that deinstitutionalization was a turning point for people with mental illnesses and their willingness to consider them full-fledged members of society. We are slowly stopping the segregation of mentally ill people by reintegration. None the less, there still is the stigma that people with mental illness are dangerous and should reintegrate, but not reintegrate into neighborhoods and communities where they can ""harm"" people. It somewhat sounds like society wants to treat people with a mental illness like pedophiles, giving them restrictions on where they should live, where they should go. It will not be surprised if within the next 10 years, with the progression of mental illness awareness, that the government/society will ask doctors to register a mentally ill person into a system that is public for the community to access. Do you think that violent mentally ill people should have restrictions if reintegrated?"
651,"The President has a platform that reaches the whole world, and everyone will listen. Not everyone may agree but it will spark a conversation throughout social media, newspapers, and will have other world leaders doing the same. The President can be effective by bringing about an end to stigmas about mental health and mental illness by, creating a national-level discussion about the topic. He can help bring stigmas out into the open and let people know they are not alone.  He can create support for our people and inform our society about the topic and spark a conversation about the matter publicly and openly."
652,"There should not be a movement to reduce benefits for mental health care and I think that it makes policymakers look incompetent. The mental health crisis is a national emergency and disaster. Mental health patients are now becoming victims. If they were to get the care they needed immediately it wouldn’t worsen their condition and make them get worse, all while sitting in a waiting room. Hospitals need to treat mental health patients as physical health patients that need immediate actions. Policymakers need to step up to the mental health crisis or get out of office."
653,"Veterans and active military have support from their VA services. Sadly, it is a reality that the VA highly medicates their veterans until they die, and if they do not report the physical or mental issue when in the service, they will not get it covered once retired or unable to be active anymore. Personally, I have seen veterans become victims of the corrupt health care system. Many veterans have brain trauma which could possibly be a TBI, but MRIs are not covered from the VA so the doctors prescribe psychiatric drugs. I think that this is the main reason veterans are prescribed drugs because alternatives are more money. Yes, a lot of veterans have mental health issues especially PTSD. Counseling is the #1 treatment that should be prescribed by the VA. Veterans should not be seen by a psychiatrist until last resort. They should see a psychologist first so they are not prescribed drugs until everything else is ruled out."
654,"Yes, society should be allowed to step in and mandate treatment for the mentally ill. I am a strong believer in 5150’s, 5250’s and 5350’s. The mentally ill are not always thinking clearly for certain illness’s, therefore we need to do the thinking for them. I think that when we need to intervene professionals need to take the patient off their medication for 72 hours to see what the underlying issues are. The mentally ill may not realize when they need help or might believe that they are fine. Therefore, we as a society have the obligation to step in and help those who may not realize they need help and give them the resources they need because we need to look out for each other."
655,"Working in an elementary school, as their school counselor (TK-8), I personally know that ending the stigma related to PWMI will not be easy. I worked in a highly Hispanic, religious, and poor school environment, which was very hostile towards mental health and a counselor. I would get many degrading comments including, “we do not tell our secrets to strangers, there’s nothing wrong with you (to their child), my child is not crazy.” These are the statements that make people hesitate to seek out help and continue on the outdated stigma related to PWMI. Then, there was the opposite position, in which parents would try to manipulate the counselor’s position. They would state: “can you fix my child, can you parent my kid or my kid plays too much video games you need to make them stop.” There is a wrong idea for the job description of a counselor or children with mental illness. I think that we can end that stigma by briefing parents in an elementary setting. Including, counselor/parent’s night, like parent/teacher night. We could simply explain who we are, the jobs we do at the schools, and the resources at their disposal. At that time, they can express any needs they have, or ask questions regarding their child/children, or even ask us to see their kid. This is a great time for parents to also ask, how they can help. I tell my parents constantly, “I see your child 30mins-1 hour a week, you are with them for over 100 hours a week, so you play a big part in their healing process,” and this shocks them. I do not know why this is brand new information, parents and teachers need to know that they are shaping their children all year round, so they need to know what to do if their kids have a mental break down or need to talk to someone. Let’s break that stigma first in elementary schools because the earlier the better. There was stigma’s I didn’t even consider before working with parents, teachers, and children, which results in social isolation. In the end, these stigmas and statements don’t help/treat anyone, they push people towards a false belief about mental health and wellness. I have personally experienced PWMI who distrusts the system with paranoia. Also, clients whose medications may be masking their medical illness, but on the other side, clients turn to medications as a first step/only steps to help with mental illnesses. One, of my 3rd graders, was in my office and said, “I can’t sleep,” and before I could step in, they said, “maybe I"
656,"Sayla-                   I loved your idea about implementing stories and songs about mental illness to young children; this would help engage the children into wanting to learn/know about mental illness. I genuinely don’t think children know what mental illness is, or what it looks like. If you were to think back to when you first learned about mental illness, how old were you? I never thought about that question, but it must have been late high school/early college. This is to late to know about something that occurs in everyone, and can tragically take a turn for the worst without any knowledge of it. Therefore, we need to educate everyone as early as possible.                   I agree about your autism position, and full handedly understand that children (who do not know better), treat/look at people with disorders differently. This stigma needs to end by telling children that there are no differences and that they are equal and want to be treated like everyone else. The stigma needs to start with the parents because children will copy what they do and how they act. How do you think we can change parents from their “old ways,” so their children do not do the same? “Parents provide nurturance, and discipline; they promote language development and act as teachers; and they are responsible for monitoring and managing the care the child receives from other adults (Maccoby & Martin 1983, Bornstein 2002).” Parents are where mental illness and mental wellness talks start, so let’s start by teaching parents about mental illness.                   Your idea of high school students seeing their psychologist every week is a good idea, but a school counselor does not have time to know every student. So, what is your plan for them to do so? I 100% agree that all staff needs to be trained on noticing symptoms or noticing when something changes and when they should go seek help. Some students don’t even see the change or know who to go to. Therefore the teachers need to realize how to help and what to do.  Reference Maccoby EE, Martin JA. 1983. Socialization in the context of the family: parent-child interaction. In Handbook of Child Psychology, ed. EM Hetherington, pp. 1–101. New York: Wiley & Sons. 4th ed."
657,"Danielle-                   I think that we need to teach mental illness courses (or not even courses) before we start teaching them about the criminal justice system. I do not agree that most schools implicate mental wellness courses (because I work in an elementary school), I think that most parents assume that the school will cover it, therefore they do not teach their child about mental illness. Not once have I seen or heard about a health class teaching the curriculum of mental health, I wish this was the case. We should take your idea and start a program that implements mental health sciences in health curriculum. Great idea! I also like the idea of guest/school speakers, this would make the kids feel like it is a “special day,” therefore they would pay more attention to what the speaker is saying. This would help give the students a place to ask questions, and there should be one student speaker each time who does research on the topic that day so the children can relate and ask them questions when the speaker was gone. Cost shifting is a huge issue, so who would you have fund the outreach and ally programs (Class Lecture, 2.3)? I think this is one of the main issues is that this a lot of money, so where should it come from? "
658,"Civil commitment seeks to prevent future behavior, so false positives and false negatives would represent huge risks to an individual and a society. False negatives and false positives would put the wrong person behind bars and keep the criminal on the streets risking everyone’s safety. Also, you would be putting the wrong person through punishment mentally and physically in which they did not deserve nor do anything wrong to deserve so. Civil services need to be specific and sensitive in regard to a state parens patria, so the state can properly act on behalf of children. It is the state’s job to protects the individual and so they can properly treat said individual if they needed medical treatment.  "
659,"In my opinion, it can be a bad idea because some sex offenders are a danger to themselves or others because some might have a mental illness. I do think that those sex offenders should be committed to temporary custody through the state. This would help them prevent harming others or themselves and would help themselves rush their commitment hearing because we don’t want to keep them in confinement too long (in regard to money and well-being). I also agree with the statement, that “the presence of mental illness alone is not sufficient for commitment.” Therefore, if a sex offender needs to be involuntarily committed then they need to be required to complete a mental illness evaluation. If they do not pass their evaluation then yes, commit them involuntarily but if they do pass then their case should immediately be presented to a judge. The longer they are in there, I think it is worsening their case. There should be a mandated turn over rate because if someone is being involuntarily committed on a Friday night, a judge will not be available until Monday. This is also a huge issue in regards to the commitment process.  "
660,"Yes, inpatient and/or outpatient can be seen as a large reach of state authority for someone’s personal liberty, but I think that is the state authorities' job. The law and the system are put into place to keep everyone safe, even if someone can’t make rational decisions to keep themselves safe. The state authorities need to step in and find help/treatment for said patient. Inpatient and outpatients need an advocate or even sometimes a proxy, therefore the state authority can act on what is best for the patient and society. Even, though multiple involuntary hospitalizations are in public facilities, privately-owned organizations need to implement a program for that purpose alone. Involuntary hospitalization is a progressive liberty issue that authorities need to update the protocols for."
661,"The pros of inpatient commitment are that a doctor has the ability to admit a patient to a hospital. I think that this is a good thing because the patient might not always realize they need help, and people tend to listen to doctors. There still needs to be more research and in house studies for inpatient commitment, and I believe that is one of the issues with studying people with mental illness. The cons for inpatient commitment are that sometime the authorities need to get involved. Sadly, when the outpatient refused to comply with the treatment plan the doctor will get officials involved to transfer the patient to a different facility to be evaluated (Swanson, Swartz, Dorn, Monahan, McGuire, Steadman, Robbins, 2009). I think that this makes the patient believe that they are “in trouble.” When authorities get involved I think that takes their mental health to a negative place, rather than support. Sending the patient to a court hearing can sometimes be excessive/coercive but necessary. The pros of outpatient commitment are that the patient is that there is a decline in homelessness (Class Lecture, 3.3). There a number amount of homeless people with a mental illness, who are not seeking treatment because they do not know they have a mental illness. If we commit them and give them the care they need and release them treated or even better, then they are less likely going to be on the streets. Outpatients are required to follow a treatment plan that may include: “self-help groups, psychotherapy, medication and may require supervised living, and urine or blood tests (Virtual Mentor. 2003),” but if the patient is not compliant then they are forced to comply. Research has also shown that outpatients who have a severe psychiatric illness are enjoying their quality of living after intervention and treatment (Class Lecture, 3.3). Also, research has shown that outpatient commitment increases the likelihood that a patient will continue their treatment after being released (Class Lecture, 3.3). This means that they understand they need help and are willing to continue to receive it without fighting it. The cons of outpatient commitment are that it can be seen as coercive by the public when they are not educated (Class Lecture, 3.3). For example, patents are forced to take medication, but people do not fully understand that those patients need medication. They have been evaluated and have been assigned to take the right medication"
662,"Stephanie-                   I found it interesting about your treatment plan for patients with mental illness. There does need to be enough staff on call for patients with needs, and no overcrowding. When you mentioned overcrowding it made me think of AB109 and the release of prisoners because they were too many to a cell. Do you think this would ever happen to a psych hospital? If so, why or why not? I do understand that people with mental illnesses need necessary treatment and therapy, therefore, they need to be committed, but what is the downfall for society?                   I agree, that when the same patient returns over and over again something needs to change drastically. The turnover rate is because there is a flaw in the system. What would you change/fix so there would be less of a turnover rate? Thank you for sharing your point of view of working wit inpatient teenagers in rehab, helped see it from a different point of view. Since you work with inpatients, how would you limit who needs more attention and where they should go? Great post, Steph!"
663,"Elise-                   I personally can see the attraction to outpatient care. I, too, would be more compliant to take medications and to continue my mental health treatment, if I was maintaining my regular routine. You mentioned that their 14 th amendment was violated, the right to due process, but in some way isn’t us forcing them to get treatment, fair? Sometimes the mentally ill do not have the mental capacity to make their own decisions or to see that they are putting themselves or society in danger. Don’t we have the right to step in to prevent that? Isn’t that the exact same thing we do with criminals? Outpatient commitment orders entail the patient to be compliant with their treatment, and if they are not compliant, then legally, they are permitted to be forced their treatment (Swanson, Swartz, Dorn, Monahan, McGuire, Steadman, Robbins, 2009).                   I like your input about how patients should be looked at and evaluated based on a case by case to protect them. I think there should be a set criterion for the professionals to abide by (Virtual Mentor, 2003). What criteria/plan would you implement for the staff? We should consider your suggestions, especially having a forensic psychologist assess “the patient before, during, and after their stay in both the outpatient and inpatient treatments.” Great idea, I would suggest the same!   Reference Jeffrey Swanson, Marvin Swartz, Richard A. Van Dorn, John Monahan, Thomas G. McGuire, Henry J. Steadman, and Pamela Clark Robbins. 2009. Racial Disparities In Involuntary Outpatient Commitment: Are They Real? Health Affairs. 28:3, 816-826. Virtual Mentor. 2003;5(10):324-327. doi: 10.1001/virtualmentor.2003.5.10.jdsc1-0310."
664,I have used and am familiar with both zoom and powerpoint!
665,"I think it depends on the mental illness, as we all know each mental illness has altering symptoms. For example, someone with schizophrenia may be hallucinating and the officer may not know they are schizophrenic. Therefore I believe that entering into the system would be the most difficult stage of the criminal process for them. Being interviewed might be difficult for them because they might not understand what is going on or the questions being asked. Also, the arrest might be difficult because they might think that the officer is trying to harm them, and trying to get them to settle down might be hard. I think that during an investigation the first question that should be asked is, “does this person (or do you) have a mental illness.”"
666,"Local jurisdictions do not have the time, money, nor the resources to care for people with mental illness. The state needs to stop taking budget cuts against mental illness and the criminal justice system. If we don’t provide the money for inmates and people with mental illness then public safety will be even worse then it is now. Cutting the funding for mental health and hospitals had driven PWMI into the criminal justice system where they are not getting the proper care they need to get better. Therefore when they get released they are going to end up back in the system again and again."
667,"No, it is not “fair” that police often serve as first responders to situations involving PWMI. I think there should be a “proxy” sent with the police if there is a person with a mental illness involved. No one should approach the PWMI until an expert is there. Only, if there is a life or death issue escalating should an officer approach someone with a mental illness. If then, they should only try to deescalate the situation and not pull out a weapon unless necessary. First responders should be sent with someone from a mental health hospital who knows how to talk to someone with a mental illness."
668,"Crisis intervention training is related to stigma because it is related to mental health. CIT is a new and upcoming system for criminal justice programs. Since CIT is not equal to other areas of training by authorities, therefore, people are not as open to it. If authorities spent just as much time training de-escalation as they do firearm training (58 hours) then there would be more expertise in the area. If 1/10 police calls are involving a mentally ill person then we also need to implement more time towards crisis intervention phone training and tactical training."
669," We need to create a positive relationship between the criminal justice system and people with mental illnesses. A great start in doing so is the start of crisis intervention training programs. The prisons are overcrowded and with a portion of that being from people with a mental illness, we need to come up with a system the breaks the barrier between the two, to help both parties out. Crisis intervention training (CIT) is still an up incoming program that is still progressing over the years (NAMI, 2012; Wood et al., 2011).  The first use of CIT models was to create arrest reduction and officer safety  (Franz & Borum, 2011; Steadman, Deane, Borum, & Morrissey, 2000; Kerr, Morabito, & Watson, 2010). Authorities need to be trained in deescalating situations involving all people, especially people with a mental illness.  Continuing crisis intervention training should be more specific in what it entails. For example, CIT models should outline why, who, where, and what they need (Canada et al., 2012). As I said in this week's previous discussions, it is not only the police authorities who need to be trained, it is everyone associated with them. For example, dispatchers need specific training (which I believe are the people who are receiving the most crisis intervention training so far). A call-for-se"
670,"Briana- Do you think that injury is the #1 predicament the mental health and criminal justice system are worried about in regards to crisis intervention training?  If so how can CIT minimize them, in your opinion? I agree that there needs to be a differentiation of authorities and specified CIT trained officers. All officers should be trained in CIT and learn how to de-escalate people with mental illnesses, but there should also be officers who are experts in the area. How many hours of training do you think is enough for a CIT officer vs a “regular” officer? Statistially, police officers receive 58 hours of firearm training and 8 hours of training about people with mental illness (Week 4 Lecture Video). Do you think there needs to be changed in this curriculum, if so where? You mentioned a great point that people with mental illnesses usually call 911/officers first, or people call complaining about them. I think there should be a different number called for these scenarios, or their call should be transferred to someone with CIT expertise. Therefore, these individuals will be treated and responded to appropriately, and hopefully lessening the amount of mentally ill people in the criminal justice system when they should be being evaluated and treated."
671,"Viviana- You discussed the one discrepancy of the CIT model being how different people and organizations define people with a mental illness, so how would you define someone with a mental illness if you were conducting the CIT program? I think that mental illness can be both a diagnosed mental illness and a mental crisis that could be temporary or even drug-induced (Taheri, 2016). As we all know people who are on drugs on not in their right mind. Knowing this would you differentiate during crisis interventions, between people on drugs and people with a mental illness? If so, how? The differentiated can cause confusion on what to do, how to act, or what service should be sent to the scene. It also has caused the issue of where the person should be sent to. Either a cell or to a hospital to be evaluated and treated. I agree that de-escalation training and CIT should be just as intense and as long as any other training received by authorities. Statistically, police officers receive 58 hours of firearm training and 8 hours of training about people with mental illness (Week 4 Lecture Video), and that statistic needs to change now. I appreciate your input about how people who are arrested have consequences and can be avoided because it can, but how? I think that we can elaborate on your idea of knowledge regarding mental health resources and involving the community. How can we integrate the two? I think that getting the community involved is a great start because the more aware they are the more they can help. What do you suggest on how to continue the crisis intervention training model for people with a mental illness?  Reference Taheri, S. A. (2016). Do crisis intervention teams reduce arrests and improve officer safety? A systematic review and meta-analysis.  Criminal Justice Policy Review,  27(1), 76-96."
672,"Bobbie- Thank you. I think that the dispatchers should be the ones coding the services needed for the person with a mental illness. Therefore, they know who to send an where. Possibly, the officer can assist on who what service to send once the scenes evaluated, but I feel there should be PWMI first responders that get sent regardless of the situation. No, I do not think that emphasizing more on one mental illness based on location is necessary for a good source of priorities. "
673,"Ka-  Thank you! Ex-military conflict resolution seems the best-case scenario, and I think they should start right now with a trial round. "
674,"Elise- Thank you! I would hope that the guidelines for training would follow the same points each training session, there would be a strict outline on what teach, to follow. I don't know where funding would come from but I would think that the mental health and criminal justice systems would apply their funding resources to this program to help them in the long run."
675,"It must be depressing and confusing for a person with mental illness to be arrested and jailed more than 100 times. As the video said, the mentally ill are only incarcerated for a couple of days or months and leave with pills and no plan. There should be a system in place that implements a plan for mentally ill inmates once released. I feel that is the reason they keep returning over 100 times. It might make them feel confused because they may not understand why they are being punished for living how they always have lived. Also, being locked up makes the mentally ill more mentally ill and can be worsening their depression. It is a vicious cycle that needs to be broken, and it starts with taking the mentally ill out of jail/prisons. "
676,"Three key indicators I feel jails should measure about mental illness   Health Status   We should measure the health status of the mentally ill so we can indicate if they are getting better or worse when released from jails/prisons. Also, we need to know if the pills provided once they leave are being taken regularly or if they have stopped taking them once they ran out.   Quality of Care  We need to measure the quality of care the mentally ill receives inside the criminal justice system. We should measure if the confinement is worsening their care or benefiting them. Also, how they are treated compared to those who are confined and not mentally ill.   Homelessness   We should measure the homelessness of the mentally ill so we can monitor if they have somewhere to go when released from jail or prison. There needs to be a census on how many mentally ill are homeless and how that affects their care."
677,"I think that there is a thin line between Jails trying to balance inmates' safety needs and their due process rights. If diagnosed no, I do not think inmates and mentally ill people should be given the right to refuse treatment or medication. They obviously are incarcerated for a reason and sometimes that reason is that their brain needs help, and they are not the person to determine that, that is not true. Maybe they can be given a family proxy who is mentally in their right mind to determine/sign off if they can receive treatment or medications. Therefore it does not feel forced upon them. So, yes I feel jail inmates are given too many rights while incarcerated. "
678,"I think it is the most common form of treatment for a person with mental illness in jails because it gets them out the door faster. What I mean by that is that medication is a bandaid for mental illness. They take the medication while in jail and it temporarily fixes their symptoms and makes them “look” better, but in reality, on the inside, it doesn’t help. So, when they get released they don’t have the funds to refill their medication or forget to take it, and they end up back in the system. Temporary fixes do not fix mental illness, and that is what the criminal justice system wants to believe. it is common to go with the easiest solution, but that solution is not treating the root of the problem. "
679,"I don’t think any part of a seriously mentally ill person being in jail is appropriate. The issue of using jails for people with a mental illness is that the size of the population has increased 4x over the past 25 years (Wilper et al., 2009). In jail alone, not prison, there are more than 730,000 people incarcerated (Minton, 2012) and in 2009 there was a study that showed every 1 out of 100 people were incarcerated (Pew Center on the States, 2008). Along, with an uprise of the jail population, there is a decline in psychiatric capacities. Sadly, there are only 14 beds in psychiatric hospitals for every 100,000 psychiatric patients who need them (Torrey et al. 2012). With jails being the new psychiatric institutions, it has caused huge constraints on both the justice system and the mentally ill and, this is unsuitable for the mentally ill patients who deserve the care they need in order to get better. There is a shortage of mental health care available in communities, and there is a lack of inpatient availability for people with mental illnesses. With a lack of bed availability, the mentally ill have to be sent to jail and are incarcerated until someone is able to assess them (Torrey et al., 2010). A study found that 40-50% of mentally ill people have been arrested at least once (Frankle et al., 2001). Operationally, this puts a constraint on the mentally ill in jail because they stay in jail longer than if they were being treated in a psychiatric institute. We could be working on how to function effectively if we spent time and resources on reverting people with a mental illness to a psychiatric institute but releasing them faster, creating more room and a better cycle throughout the institute rather than in jails.   Architecturally, the settings inside a jail are not suitable for a mentally ill person to live in (Scheyett, Vaghn, & Taylor, 2009). If anyone, especially a mentally ill person has not properly taken their medication or are abusing drugs and/or alcohol, it can worsen the arresting of a mentally ill person (Buffington-Vollum, 2011). Also, with there being overcrowding, because of increased populations in jail, there are huge constraints and limitations to their health conditions, lack of privacy, food, sleep, lighting, sounds, and the boredom/stress is affected.   I think that the number one issue with a seriously mentally ill person being incarcerated is the funding. If there is low funding then they are not get"
680,"Elise- Thank you. I would try to start over completely. Since it seems that not much is working in favor of the mentally ill, we should start with a clean slate. Both state and federal levels will fund the reform, but in the end, I think it would save money, rather than wasting it, which is what is happening now. I hope that a new reform is in the process of being started because we sincerely need one. "
681,"Elise- Your input was insightful. So, how is their well-being inappropriate in the criminal justice system and in jails? How can we realign and reform jails to have more funding, space and fewer constraints on the mentally ill? Great point that their 8 th amendment right is being violated because I think for a mentally ill person to be in jail is cruel and unusual punishment. I don’t think it’s the referrals of PWMI to mental health facilities that are the issue, I think they are being referred but there is no room for them. As we spoke about last week authorities should be training in crisis intervention training but not all mentally ill scenes are crisis, some only are being arrested for petty crimes (i.e. trespassing or theft) and are being incarcerated over and over again because they were stealing food or trying to find a place to sleep (Taheri, 2014).  What do you think we should do about this issue? Inmates and especially mentally ill inmates are not receiving the care they need. In 2004, 100,439 psychiatric beds were available in all psychiatric hospitals and in general hospitals (Torrey, Kennard, Eslinger, Lamb, Pavle, 2010). This means there was 1 bed for every 3,000 people which is 1/10 th the amount of space since 1955. This causes the mentally ill to be pushed from a bed in a psych hospital to a jail cell with no care. In studies and research, there has been evidence that suggests people who have a mental illness in jails are at higher risk of being assaulted and victimized and will likely not receive sufficient enough mental health services while incarcerated (Raphael & Stoll, 2013). We as a society are transinsitutionalizing the mentally ill to jails instead of intensive care facilities and that needs to come to an end.   References Raphael, Steven & Stoll, Michael. (2013). Assessing the Contribution of the Deinstitutionalization of the Mentally Ill to Growth in the U.S. Incarceration Rate. The Journal of Legal Studies. 42. 187-222. 10.1086/667773. Taheri, S. A. (2014).

682,"Viviana- You mentioned the poor physical and mental health of people in jails but how is it worse for people with a severe mental illness? Also, do you think that this is in violation of their 8 th amendment right? If so, how? I agree, that there is a huge need to reform and reconstruct the criminal justice system, especially persons with mental illness. They do not deserve to be in the criminal justice system, that is not the place for them. Therefore, I agree with your statement is that people with mental illness who commit crimes should not be in jails. I think that the mentally ill commit not so serious crimes but re-offend more. Their re-offenses for petty crimes are what affects them the most because they cycle through jail over and over again. Great idea about having a diversion program and treatment plan created for people with mental illness who commit crimes. How would the program and treatment be designed? Also, who would fund it? I think that the community needs to be more involved to help provide the necessities for people with a mental illness. Realignment is aimed to send the least violent offenders to jails, but why would the mentally ill be part of this category? They are currently serving longer sentences while incarcerated than those who are not mentally ill and who have committed the same offense. The funding is directed towards beds health services and activities, how can we redirect this funding’s so the mentally ill can benefit from it (Lofstrom et al., 2010)? The community needs to be involved and integrated into helping solve the realignment of people with mental illness in the criminal justice system. Reference Lofstrom, M., Bird, M., & Martin, B. (2016). California's historic corrections reforms. San Francisco, CA: Public Policy Institute of California."
683,"Yes, I think it is fair because it gives us an idea. If they can give us the slightest prediction of future recidivism then why not use them? Also, what would we use instead? How would we assess someone as a criminal? As said in the video, 1 in 5 people go back to jail after probation. How can we make that number almost 0 in 5 people? We should use cognitive-behavioral techniques to help provide a consistent database to help with the ability and learning styles of offenders so we can track consistent trends of incarcerated people."
684,"Mental health professionals would be somewhat receptive to the Risk Needs Responsivity Model. I think that the professionals and specialists who have been in the fields awhile, would not be very open to trying something new because they see what does and does not work. Changing your ways after a period of time would be difficult. Teaching people cognitive behavioral techniques is difficult, especially if you are just learning them after many decades of not being in school. Young individuals would be more receptive, especially those right out of college because they would be taught RNR right away and would not know any other model. An issue that can arise besides recidivism is the focus on the higher-risk offenders. This means they are not focusing on low-risk offenders, possibly pedophiles or theft. Also, another low crime would be crimes linked to homelessness in which a portion of the criminal justice system and mental health system consists of. RNR would be useful to provide services and treatment that are consistent with offenders with mental illness who have a set ability and learning style."
685,"Probation is not designed for people with a mental illness. It was created for criminals so I cant believe that there would be any design of supervision nor treatment for persons with mental illness specifically. There are 400,000 people on probation at the moment and most are felons, but we do not know what percentage of those are mentally ill. Those on probation need to be held accountable for their actions and for a lot of mental illnesses people cannot be held accountable. Comparing probation to jail, I think probation is the smarter choice for those who are not dangerous, violent, or mentally ill. Jail is not the answer for the mentally ill either, but probation is cost-effective. Probation is the appropriate sanction for lawbreakers because it allows them to remain in the community but under supervision and rules. If those rules are broken, then yes they should go to jail. As said in the video, prison does not change behavior, therefore, prison nor jail is not the answer."
686,"I would love to participate in a mental health court. No, I would not prefer the traditional court processing. I would like to treat the people within the criminal justice system, to help improve recidivism rates. I would like to help oversee the therapeutic progress of people with mental illness and help return them to their homes and families. I would like to also educate the families on their loved one's condition for signs to look out for and resources to reach out to incase needed. I do not want to criminalize the mentally ill for something they cannot control, whereas I would like to educate the community on what steps to take to help prevent the criminalization of the mentally ill. The mentally ill have rights too, and they should not be taken for granted. Costs can be high for mental health court but it is cheaper than to incarcerate them. We need to help expand the mental health court as we need to expand mental health hospitals. Doing so would reduce the incarceration of mentally ill inmates."
687,"The risk-need-responsivity (RNR) model is used to reduce recidivism (Skeem, Steadman, and Manchak, 2015). This new policy aims to provide correctional treatment services to reduce recidivism in the criminal justice system. As mentioned in the article by Skeem et al. (2015), we need to inform the Chief Probation Officer that we need to apply these methods to a population with unique characteristics. He needs to combine the mental illness population with the criminal justice system population. If he is trying to reduce mass incarceration then we need to study both populations separately and together (Skeem, Manachak, & Montoya, 2017). Comparing We can improve the outcome of people with mental illness not ending up in the criminal justice system, which everyone wants. The Chief Probation Officer needs to supervise violence in order to reduce general recidivism (Skeem, Manachak, & Montoya, 2017). The chief should be looking for better public safety and with that starts a reform of the whole probation process of people with mental illness. He needs to reform the people with mental illness within the justice system, by creating a different budget for them. Also, he needs to have specific professionals and specialists in charge of people with mental illness on probation. He needs to assign a team of people who are professionals in forensic psychology to be their probation officers, not “regular” probation officers. This is where part of the budget will go to, and also part of it towards rehabilitation services while on probation. People on probation with mental illness need special care and services to help them return back to society. Yes, everyone on probation might need these services, but people with mental illness specifically need them. I think that this would help with reducing recidivism and go beyond treating just the psychiatric symptoms by address the variable risk factors for crime.    References Jennifer L. Skeem, Henry J.

688,"Stephanie- I like your idea to monitor substance abuse and to get people with mental illness treatment. I mentioned that rehabilitative services should be more prone to them while on probation. How would we or the Chief monitor the substance abuse for treatment? I didn’t even consider the point you made about violent behavior with people with mental illness, a great point. I usually, consider delusion or hallucinations or even psychotic breaks. Violent behavior is a huge issue, even could be the reason the person is in the criminal justice system, to begin with. Great consideration. We need to lower recidivism by lower risk factors, and drugs are a huge part of violent risks, but what if the person with mental illness is the opposite (Skeem, Steadman, and Manchak, 2015). What if they didn’t take their medication? As we know it is important for them to consistently take their medication, therefore if they have stopped taking it how could the Chief manipulate a program to help control the intake of the mentally ill to take their medication responsibly? We do need to do more studies on RNR because it is a new policy, and with any new policy we need more research. I also stated that we need specialists to work in the criminal justice probation system to help with recidivism rates and rehabilitation. Do you think this would be a good role for a forensic psychologist? If not then who? Great post!    References Jennifer L. Skeem, Henry J. Steadman, and Sarah M. Manchak, 2015.

689,"Nicolle- The new policy of the risk-need-responsivity (RNR) model is used to reduce recidivism (Skeem, Steadman, and Manchak, 2015). There needs to be more research on the RNR Model policy to create enough data to work off of and make it successful. You mentioned the study by Skeem, Polaschek, and Manchak in 2009 and it mentioned that it figured out how to decrease violence and antisocial behaviors among high risk and psychiatric patients when exposed to intensive treatment. How can The Chief Probation Officer use this research to help with the supervision of Mental illness on probation? There need to be more trial interventions to help people with mental illness who are on probation. I agree that we need to treat risk factors that lead people with mental illnesses to criminal behavior (Skeem, Steadman, & Manchak, 2015). Therefore, they do not end up in the criminal justice system, to begin with, and don’t end up on probation. I like that you mentioned that the mentally ill are rarely violent but rather are arrested on petty theft crimes or trespassing (Grzanich, 2013). How can the Chief Probation Officer take this information and help those on probation with a mental illness? How can he turn it around to help them? I think that we need a reform-based mainly on budgets and funding. I think this would help with recidivism rates. Good post.    References  Grzanich, S.

690,"I think that the prison environment strips away the dignity of a human by making them feel inhumane. For people with mental illness, I think that this feeling is enhanced by 10x. The prison environment is harsh and cruel for criminals in general, but people with mental illness do not have the same mentality. They go through harsher living by just existing. What goes on in their head is already enough cruelty to live with but to live in a confined condition can worsen their mentality. I think that it can make them have a psychotic break or make their condition worse, and harder to rehabilitate."
691,"Yes, I think that we can rehabilitate prisoners with mental illness, but mental illness never goes away completely. It is something people have to live with for the rest of their lives, and that includes prisoners. Insufficient funds are the core issue for rehabilitating prisoners with mental illness. I agree with the video, that prison can worsen mental illness and that can worsen their rehabilitation. I think that we need to help with consistency. Meaning that in the video they were worried not about if they are getting the help they need in prison but when they get out. We need to create a system that gives them consistent rehabilitation both inside and outside of prison, or recidivism will occur. The rehabilitation focus should be: what can we do for them! Community monitoring would help with rehabilitating prisoners with mental illness once released from prison."
692,"I don’t agree with solitary confinement. There are too many disadvantages for the inmates, including paranoia, anger, losing their senses, losing a sense of control, antisocial disorders, and lack of emotion. If you make some take away their senses, then they are not considered a human being anymore. Making someone not feel alive or have a will to live is worthless. I believe that solitary confinement can push someone to have a psychiatric breakdown, and this is someone who does not have a mental illness. I think you can cause someone in solitary confinement to break and then cause them to be mentally ill. The paranoia can cause hysteria, delusion, PTSD, etc. I don’t think the advantages of solitary confinement help maintain prisons at all. I think a better time could be spent rehabilitating or deescalating the person. Inmates are people too, therefore we should treat them as a human. "
693,"Based on the video, I think that taxpayers' dollars can be better spent on treating the mentally ill in psych institutes, not prison. As stated, it takes $2,200 taxpayers dollars to help treat someone who is severely mentally ill and $22,000 to take care of them in a prison. We need to reform and reconstruct finances for the mentally ill and how we spend taxpayers' money on them. If there are 1 in 4 people in prison who need mental health care then there is a problem the criminal justice system is not taking care of, and the mentally ill are not getting the proper health care they need nor treatment. We are wasting 18 million dollars in the wrong places rather than rerouting the money to mental health care rather than criminal justice care. There is poor money management towards health care of mental illness. We need to conduct more evidence-based treatment to care for our mentally ill community."
694,"Prisons number one priority should be to maintain a safe and protected upkeep for staff and inmates. They can meet the needs by obtaining all previous information from the inmate before processing them into the prison. What I mean by that is gather as much information they can on the prisoner before they enter the prison. They should do this so they can group together individuals who are less likely to start fights or collude with other prisoners. I think if there was an assessment before entering prison then it will decrease the amount of unsafety for inmates and staff, to help keep everyone safe. I think the main issue with people with mental illness in prison is costs and funding. I don’t think we should provide treatment for people with mental illness in a prison. I think they should be treated at mental hospitals only.  Costs should be diverted from prisons to mental hospitals so people with mental illness can consistently receive treatment, so they do not end up in prison/criminal justice system. That is how we contain costs by not having people with mental illness in prison to begin with. I think that reform of both the criminal justice system and mental hospitals is what is needed to relocate funding and costs for inmates and for people with mental illness. Reforming where prisoners and people with mental illness are sent and how money is spent on both is where we need to change how the money is spent. I would like to see a spreadsheet for prisons and mental hospitals so I know where costs are going because the smallest change could help. Yes, people with mental illness should receive more resources, specially allocated staff and programming, but not in prison. People with mental illnesses have more issues that need hands-on care. They need to be watched for symptoms and interactions. I think that they should also be highly evaluated before entered into any system, and thoroughly. I think people with mental illness need rehabilitative sources and programs. I think if we allocate their programs as modules to go through weekly, then they would feel more rewarded and accomplish more rehabilitation."
695,"Briana- Different residential environments for inmates and people with mental illness would be a great start to reforming the prison system. Possible, by dividing them by color or number, for example, the higher the number the more dangerous the inmate/mentally ill person is. Don’ you think that people with mental illness should be diverted from correctional facilities? They therapeutic environments for people with mental illness should be in mental hospitals. I like that you stated we should classify people with mental illness who have committed a crime differently than those inmates who are not mentally ill, but how would we properly diagnose and treat those inmates or people with mental illness? Great idea to use screening tools to help maintain costs, but what specific screening tools and assessment tools would be used to classify inmates with mental illness differently than those who are not mentally ill? I think we should use specialists who are trained in their specific diagnoses to help treat, reform and assess inmates with mental illness. I don’t think the main issues are properly diagnosing and treating inmates with mental illness. I think the main issue is that people with mental illness are in the criminal justice system, to begin with. You mentioned having a safer housing united and environment but what would make the environment safer for them? I never compared their mental health treatment to their physical health treatment, but that does seem what is happening in prison for treatment. I think they are going to one appointment and possible receiving medication and not be assessed further. What resources do you think they need more of? I agree with you that when people with mental illness are released from prison it is harder for them to receive treatment and maintain a strict rehabilitative mindset. I hope in the near future we reassess people with mental illness in the prison system. Great post!"
696,"Elise- Great thoughts, we agreed on most of the same issues. When you talked about screen assessments by Adams & Ferrandino, what specific screening tools would you want to implement in the prison system (2018)? The issues that arise are the potential mental health problems that are cohabitating inmates with mentally ill people. I don’t think that they should both be in the prison/criminal justice system. There should be a controlled area for them both, but not together. How can we better asses the need for treatment of potentially risky mentally ill inmates to better equip staff (Adams & Ferrandino, 2018)? I also stated that we need to previously evaluate them before entering any system so we can do a better job caring for them. We need to put them in the right facility so they can rehabilitate them properly. Great point that it will help them become more socially effective citizens. I think that if we have better resources in the system then when they are out in the community it will decrease the amount of recidivism. We need to help everyone be safe while in the system including staff and inmates, and I think by doing so we should separate the two. Agreed, that there needs to be a change in funding. We should allocate more money toward people with mental illness and deterring them away from the prison population. we need to relocate people who have offended and are mentally ill to mental hospitals. This would help lower the rates of recidivism and money will be better spent on mental health care of those who have offended. People with mental illness deserve more resources and care to receive the proper necessary treatment in and out of the system.  Reference Adams, K., & Ferrandino, J. (2008). Managing mentally ill inmates in prisons. Criminal Justice and Behavior, 35(8), 913-927."
697,"If I were a taxpayer in Missouri I would be so happy about the construction of the new Fulton State Hospital. I think all mental hospitals need a modern renovation to implement modern treatment for the mentally ill community. I think the construction of the hospital brings back humanity to the community. I think a new administration along with new hospitals is a great start to modernly helping those with mental illness. I think this will help stop people with mental illness being swept in the criminal justice system. I think we need to help draw a line between who becomes administered in the criminal justice system and who ends up at the mental hospital. People with mental illness will get the 24 hour care they deserve and without the care, people with mental illness will lead a chaotic and dysphoric lifestyle in the community, and will contribute to the population of homeless mentally ill and mentally ill in jails."
698,"No, I would not describe the not guilty by reason of insanity a “get out of jail free” card. Only 1% of cases use not guilty by reason of insanity and only a quarter of that succeed in their cases. I think the definition explains not guilty by reason of insanity nicely as “a defendant labored under such defect of reason from disease of the mind as to not realize what he was doing or why it was a crime.” Yes, sometimes people use the plea not guilty by reason of insanity as a last case scenario when they know they are going away for life so they might as well try to go to a psych hospital rather than prison. I don’t think they are not guilty they are. I think they should rename it as guilty by reason of insanity because they are guilty of the crime but may not know it."
699,"I would first like to see the protocol in place at state hospitals for patient and staff safety. I think it should be against the law to have unqualified staff take care of and be in charge of people with mental illness. I don’t think it is just the safety of patients and staff but also the community. Especially, if the hospital is in the middle of the city, and someone escapes. What is the protocol then? Most likely the police are called, but as we know the police are not always the best and someone else should help retrieve the patient. We need to deal with patient care so the staff is safe by providing better more calming treatment. If a patient gets too out of hand the staff might become aggressive, creating their treatment to go back to square one. People with mental illness deserve the best treatment under highly pressurized circumstances."
700,"I like deep brain stimulation as a last resort for the treatment of depression. It is still experimental therefore it is still questionable. As we know brain surgery is very dangerous so I believe deep brain stimulation should be the last treatment tried for depression by the patient. After they try psychiatric medication, counseling, brain scans, and different kinds of therapy, then they should result in deep brain stimulation. Only if they are right for the treatment should they have it because only 2/3 of patients have positive results from it? I think there could also be a placebo effect that goes along with deep brain stimulation, meaning, they believe they are getting treated daily so they feel better and less depressed. I also think that along with the deep brain stimulation the patient receives counseling treatment so the depression does not come back differently."
701,"I think the most appropriate role is for state hospitals to provide the utmost care for those with mental illness in the criminal justice system. Those who are incarcerated with mental health conditions are receiving treatment from the state hospitals. There they have several rights under State and Federal laws given to them by the Constitutional and Statutory laws. Their rights are even modified so the staff and patients are ensured their safety and security (Dsh.ca.gov, 2019). I was curious about what rights those incarcerated have that are subject to be held in state hospitals. Under Title 9 of the California Code of Regulations, Section 883, they are as followed: Forensic Patients have the following rights:   A right to privacy, dignity, respect, and humane care. A right to receive treatment for a diagnosed mental disorder that is provided in a method least restrictive of individual liberty and promotes personal independence. A right to medical care and treatment for physical ailments and conditions according to accepted clinical standards and practices. A right to refuse psychosurgery, electroconvulsive therapy, experimental and other hazardous procedures. A right to be free from harm including abuse or neglect, and unnecessary or excessive medication, restraint, seclusion, or protective or administrative isolation. Medication, restraint, seclusion, or protective or administrative isolation shall not be used as punishment, as retaliation for filing complaints, for the convenience of staff, as a substitute for a treatment program or in quantities that interfere with the patient's treatment. A right to confidential case discussions, consultation, examination, and patient records. Confidential information shall only be provided to those people providing evaluation and/or treatment or as authorized by law. A right to be informed of the procedures for filing complaints and the process for appeals when complaints are not resolved to the patient's satisfaction. A right to access the services of a Patients' Rights Advocate. A right to confidential communications with an attorney, either through correspondence or through private consultation, during regularly scheduled visiting days and hours. A right to religious freedom and practice, within the context of the environment of a secure treatment facility. A right to opportunities for physi"
702,"Elise- Great point, those with mental illness should not be turned away based on the fact that the state hospitals are funding all their money and resources towards forensic patients exclusively. Rather, they should be working alongside them. They shouldn’t be against each other they should both be able to cohabitate in the same facility but different levels. We should reform and reconstruct the hospitals, but if we can’t fund more important aspects of the mental health and criminal justice system, then how will they find funding to reconstruct over 200+ hospitals (Fisher, Geller, Pandiani, 2009)? What would the guidelines and rights be for patients who are incriminated with violent crimes? Those who are violent may act out and try to harm those who are mentally ill. How would we prevent that? We could possibly put them on different levels, but inmates can escape and try to be violent, so how can we create a system the cohabitates both the mentally ill and criminal justice system?  References Fisher WH, Geller JL, Pandiani JA. (2009). The changing role of the state psychiatric hospital. Implementation Science and Practice Advances Research Center Publications.  "
703,"Viviana- Interesting point of view, but I don’t think that patients' wellbeing and care should be compromised because prison staff is not capable of treating people with mental illness due to trying to balance their institutional security and patient wellbeing (Sisti, Segal, & Emanuel, 2015). They should be sufficiently trained to work under those conditions, and if they are not they should not be treating those with mental illness or work in the criminal justice system. We should not segregate the two because we have been doing so for long enough and it isn’t working. We now have up and coming research, studies, and sufficient workers to treat those who have been incriminated with mental illness. For example, we are trained and have researched both mental illness and the criminal justice system. Forensic psychologists should come up with a perfect balance to help reform both systems. Yes, we should care for those with severe mental illness as humanely as possible, but I do not think the hospitals should be providing refuge, but rather care (Sisti et al., 2015). I agree, that if the patients don’t receive sufficient care when released then they will come back and that’s how recidivism rates rise. How do you think we can lower recidivism rates for those in state hospitals with a mental illness who are also in the criminal justice system?  References Sisti, D. A., Segal, A. G., & Emanuel, E. J. (2015). Improving long-term psychiatric care: bring back the asylum. Jama, 313(3), 243-244.  "
704,"I think we are a long way from a satisfactory understanding of the link between the criminal justice and mental health systems and their clients. We need to take the research we have and implement it into both systems. It seems that no one is progressing the research, just conducting it. That’s great, but why do the research if you aren’t going to act on it? If 1/3 of people who are arrested have unresolved mental issues, then we need to screen everyone before we process them. We only provide 40% of mentally ill inmates with services when they are released, then they will re-offend and raise recidivism rates. We need to have a place in between prison/psych hospitals for the mentally ill to stay that is safe and provides them aftercare services. We need more coordinating care, increased services, and fewer barriers."
705,"The crisis intervention training approach appeared not as hands-on as I would hope for in a crisis situation. I did like that they provided services and had face to face intervention with the wife to talk about what was going on. I wish they were showing a more mentally ill situation because this guy complied with everything they told him to do. In my mind, that isn’t realistic and to learn about crisis intervention training I would learn more from seeing someone who wasn’t complying with the officers, and see how the officers would react in the situation. Everyone seemed easy going and happy as if it were easy, and I know it is not. Therefore, this video did not properly show the tasks of crisis intervention training."
706,"I think persons with mental illnesses is a sensitive subject for those who are not familiar with it. So, those who have had an awful extreme loss or situation involving a person with mental illness complain and make a public disagreement of their situation. Some write letters and complaints to the city stating the problems they have been involved in regarding those with mental illnesses. I think after awhile the city has had enough complaints to the point where they will finally do something public, like implement a legal action or court order. It reminds me of the huge legal issues involving cops planting drugs, or assaulting people they are arresting, so a court order forced police to wear body cams. It takes enough complaints to compile to finally make a change."
707,"I think mental health workers in the correctional environment have the main challenge of the stigma. The stigma that comes with working with mentally ill criminals, the first thing people think of is dangerous, but as the clinical worker stated in the video, “we are just working with other people, that’s it they are people.” I think sometimes people can forget that, and assume the worst (and ill admit sometimes I think that way). It is a case of habit and it is hard to get rid of but the workers communicating and engaging with the criminally mentally ill is a great way to deal with it in the correctional environment. I think cross-training with correction staff/agencies would help network their work and promote that the stigma is gone, and the staff is helping these people, community, and society. How we treat prisoners is how we treat the most vulnerable people in our society, and we should care for them as if we knew them personally. "
708,"In the last 4 decades, people with mental health issues and law enforcement have had some policies created to intertwine the two systems to create a safer, more amicable community (Lurigio & Watson, 2010). The criminal justice system needs to implement a team to be specifically trained to assist in all persons with mental illness criteria. I think that there should be one specified person at all times on call for persons with mental illness crisis scenes. When needed they can meet at the scene and assist when needed. In addition, I agreed with the criteria Dr. Parker studied, which made correctional officers take a 10-hour mental health training program  (Parker, 2009). This was created by the Indiana chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI-Indiana) for those who were housed in supermax prison/special housing units. They were taught for 5 weeks and repeated after every 15 months for those who were new on staff. If I was creating an essential training for mental health and criminal justice actors to benefit those with mental illness I would have the program run longer because the results shown for just 5 weeks were great, but I would have had it for 10 weeks. The 5-week program decreased the number of reported incidents by staff  (Parker, 2009). Also, there was less use of force, battery, use of bodily waste on the officers. I think we can decrease the use of force if there was someone present specialized in mental health and if they were trained every 6 months. The correctional officers seemed to enjoy the training and learned a lot of new skills to implement. Therefore, I think that we should conduct it worldwide. Since, law enforcement works with a lot of people with mental illness we need to make the two systems one, meaning an essential reform. We want fewer incidents and the results from this study showed a significant decrease in instances, suggesting that we should provide an essential mental health training program for the criminal justice actors to benefit the people with mental illness to create a safer working environment and living conditions for offenders. People with mental illness are a vulnerable population therefore we need the interactions between mental health and criminal justice actors to help people with mental illness, not damage them further. I hope to see a better interaction and a step towards the essential reform of these two systems in the near future.   Referenc"
709,"Serenity- Great ideas. I agree that criminal justice actors should be trained in responding to PWMI crisis situations, both in public and behind jail and prison walls. I thought that too but what de-escalation techniques should they be taught? Who will teach them these techniques? How long are they taught these techniques? I think there should be some form of the certification process and at least one person who is certified in the training should be at every crisis scene. Yes, it is essential to properly comprehend mental health and the crisis situations that come along with dangerous situations. The safety issues are the main problem when working with persons with mental illness who are in crisis. I concur that we need to have de-escalating techniques to have unwanted injuries and deaths, and also promote officers from taking persons with mental illness to prison and rather to a safer place with resources for them.   I think mental health workers in the correctional environment have the main challenge of the stigma. The stigma that comes with working with mentally ill criminals, the first thing people think of is dangerous, but as the clinical worker stated in the video, “we are just working with other people, that’s it they are people.” I think sometimes people can forget that, and assume the worst (and I’ll admit sometimes I think that way). It is a case of habit and it is hard to get rid of but the workers communicating and engaging with the criminally mentally ill is a great way to deal with it in the correctional environment. I think cross-training with correction staff/agencies would help network their work and promote that the stigma is gone, and the staff is helping these people, community, and society. I agree with your point about their rights because not a lot of people think people with mental illness have rights. The officers need to notice the signs and symptoms of people with mental illness so they can accommodate them. I think that all incoming crisis situations personnel need to be evaluated before being sent anywhere, whether that be in an ambulance, or at a police station, etc. I think this would help by creating less prison and hospital overpopulation. It could be as simple as they missed a dose of their medication, and that’s all they need. So, evaluating them would help break that barrier, and give them what they need so they don’t have to waste the criminal justices’ time and money."
710,"Karen- In my opinion I think that the crisis intervention training model is considered the “best practice” because it is the only practice taught to criminal justice personnel. Do you think that the crisis intervention training model needs adjustment? If so, what would you change? I think that there should be a fourth aspect included in law enforcement, ambulances, and mental health services that arrive on the scene of a crisis situation (Watson & Fulambarker, 2012). I think that there should be certified forensic psychologists onsite for every situation involving persons with mental illness, especially crisis’. I agree that there needs to be law enforcement designated psychiatric emergency drop off (Watson & Fulambarker, 2012). I think this would help divert persons with mental illness away from prisons and more to psych hospitals or emergency rooms. This would also help with treatment options, mental illness’ relationship with crime, and strategies for interacting with PWMI that would include roleplaying. I concur with your thoughts about symptoms linked to persons with mental illness and that law enforcement needs to be able to recognize them. The should recognize symptoms so they can properly access the situation of the crisis. They need to be able to de-escalate the scenario and be able to relay the information onto the next person. Persons with mental illness deserve a safe environment and community just as much as the next person. We can do so by creating more international training based off our research to help integrate law enforcement and forensic psychology.    Reference Watson, A.C., & Fulambarker, A.J. (2012). The Crisis Intervention Team Model of Police Response to Mental Health Crises: A Primer for Mental Health Practitioners. Best practices in mental health, 8 2, 71  ."
711,"I think that there should be a similar program in place for violent offenders with mental health issues. For example, an officer can drop off a violent offender at a rehabilitative establishment and give custody to another officer specialized in crisis intervention team training. There should be crisis response care for both non-violent and violent offenders. They need rehabilitative services therefore they need treatment, not incarceration. I think this would help divert nonviolent to rehab rather than jail.  I find it great that there are more and more diversion efforts in place for mentally ill offenders. I think there should be one hospital near all prisons and jails so offenders can be easily accessible. There should be on the floor for non-violent offenders and a floor for violent offenders."
712,"I think that we can implement evidence-based practices in both the mental health system and the criminal justice system. They might not be the same, but they are both rigorous in classification. I think the mental health evidence-based practice is newer and upcoming and the criminal justice system evidence-based practices have been around longer. They both need more objective measures and more research to implement a new integrated system between the two systems. We should build on scientific principles of testing each evidence-based practice effectiveness. The hurdles are more the same than different because they both have standardized treatment and services subjected to controlled research with objective measures and more than one research group."
713,"I think that there would be a decrease in the number of people we have in the criminal justice system, along with lower recidivism rates. I think local agencies can partner together to integrate mental health and substance abuse, models. I think that finances would actually have more ebb and flow because we will be transitioning funds from the criminal justice system to more mental health system and substance abuse model services. I think there will be different funding streams along with different providers and limited benefits for drug arrests. I think that licenses for mental health and substance abuse should be handled separately unless it has been stabled that they have co-occurring disorders. If research shows that comprehensive integrated efforts with dually diagnosed help reduce substance abuse and sustain mental health recovery. Therefore, I think that there would be a reduction in hospital utilization, psychiatric symptomatology, and lower recidivism rates."
714,"I think that peer mentoring would be helpful in addressing the mental illness stigma by helping people through association. People like to know that someone else is going through the exact same thing as them and that they are not alone. Sometimes people with mental illness don’t like talking about their problems because they are worried, they are the only one going through it or that it makes them an outcast. Meanwhile, it is the opposite, not enough people talk about their mental illness therefore there is a stigma. I think that at one point in time everyone goes through some time of mental illness either big or small. We all have our own way of dealing with it, but talking about it with peer mentoring will help."
715,"The implications of the recommendations by the American College of Physicians will affect the criminal justice system. I think that the paper applied for the important goals regarding advocacy, research, and practice to help achieve the outcomes of the mentally ill in the criminal justice system (Crowley and Kirschner, 2015). Behavioral health care is a very important aspect of the mental health crisis in the criminal justice system. Patients' care and conditions should be our top priority to help decrease recidivism within both systems and find prolonged care, therefore they don’t end up back where they started. It is important for the health care system to address these issues to help create a safe and inhabitable environment for people in the mentally ill and criminal justice systems. To help address these issues and conditions we need to do a better job integrating behavioral health into the primary care setting (Crowley and Kirschner, 2015). I think there are too many barriers in the way of trying to help make this process simple and easy for the mentally ill and their families. Primary care should not be that difficult especially for those who are not fully coherent to make their own decisions, sometimes. Here are the recommendations by the American College of Physicians, and my thoughts:   The ACP supports the integration of behavioral health care into primary care and encourages its members to address behavioral health issues within the limits of their competencies and resources. (I think that recommendation #1 is a great start and should be implemented immediately. The mental health and criminal justice communities are very vulnerable and do not have the full competencies and resources to act on what is always best for themselves). The ACP recommends that public and private health insurance payers, policymakers, and primary care and behavioral health care professionals work toward removing payment barriers that impede behavioral health and primary care integration. Stakeholders should also ensure the availability of adequate financial resources to support the practice infrastructure required to effectively provide such care. (I agree that payment barriers are a huge issue into recidivism because what we learned in another module is that debt, child support, and unpaid payments is a huge barrier once released. There needs to be a forgiveness period once released. The ACP recommends that federal and state"
716,"Alyse- I too saw the connection between previous modules and how they helped with the connection between mental health and the criminal justice systems crisis of behavioral health care. I think if we were to manipulate both systems to stray away from medication as treatment, we would see a flourish in every aspect of behavioral health for people with mental illness in the prison system. I agree that this is a risk for future recidivism as it fixes nothing. When they are released from both systems they return to their same lifestyles with barriers. Great suggestion, we should integrate the fields of mental health care within the criminal justice system. Where should they start? I don’t think it will be cost-effective, to begin with, but in the end,  I think it will decrease recidivism rates and repeat offenders. I think that is where we need to start, by keeping inmates off the streets, preventing future mental illness outbreaks, and creating deep reform/strategies in behavioral health care. Great post!

717,"Viviana- I think that we need to fuse the mental health system with the criminal justice system together so they can come up with a better integration process for the two. I don’t think that treatment is the main issue, but one of them. Primary care all together should fuse on having primary care doctors address mental health, removing payment barriers, strengthening non-discrimination policies, streamlining the most effective treatment and integration approaches, providing continuing education and cross-training for mental health and primary care physicians and, reducing stigma held by the general population and the medical community (Crowley and Kirschner, 2015). Where should they start, and how would they implement all these issues? Do you think currently they are upheld to the same ethical standards as others? I think the stigma is a huge issue and the root of most of their problems. How could we as a community help get rid of this stigma of mentally ill people in the criminal justice system? I think we could help educate the general population to teach about how these people are upon our community just like we are. If we educate those who need it, then I think we can help break this stigma. Great input.

718,"I think that we should increase research because the system is not trained well enough in identifying people with mental illness in the criminal justice system. If we sought out more people with mental illness and trained/educated professionals in identifying them, then we would have fewer people with mental illness in prisons and jails. We would be able to divert them away from incarceration and more towards facilities with prolonged health care for their needs, to help reduce recidivism and reoffending. The effect on the outcomes for people with mental illness is that they will receive better care, leading to less risk for the community and less money towards rehabilitation. If we provide more research towards people with mental illness about identifying who they are, more training for enforcement agencies on how to identify a person with mental illness, and education on treatment staff, then we should be able to decrease the number of people with mental illness ending up incarcerated."
719,"It seems so simple.  Timothy Souders was in a mental crisis.  He needed psychiatric help.  He needed coping mechanisms, alleviation of stimulus, medication, resources, and professional help.  In his last four days, during which he exhibited the most acute symptoms of crisis, he received none of those.  It is easy for us to look at it from our 10,000-foot view and Monday-morning quarterback Timothy Souders' passing.  But even the most untrained officers must have recognized that there was a problem.  He was getting weaker and less responsive as time passed.  I cannot imagine that if they had brought mental health professionals to bear on the situation that it would have borne out in the same manner.  "
720,"Non-medical considerations must first be defined.  We have to understand that those manifesting hallucinations or delusions are clearly exhibiting signs of medical mental illness.  Conversely, those who merely do not fit into social norms are not showing medical signs of mental illness.  For example, a woman who dresses like a man or acts outside society's expectations of female behavior may have been identified as mentally ill, yet she is not  medically mentally ill.   Those who are odd, strange, or don't fit in have been sent to asylums to hide them from ""normal"" society.  Essentially, ""out-of-sight, out-of-mind.""  This drives treatment and care for people with mental illness by proliferating the idea that mental illness is more widespread.  It permeates every aspect of society, from the rich to the poor.  Those who are not accepted outside the walls may be placed within the walls to ensure they do not reflect poorly upon the rest of us.   I recognize this was in the earlier expansion of asylums, particularly in the 19th century.  Even now, though, we are not as strong as we could be at identifying, treating, and supporting mental illness.  "
721,"I am torn on this topic.  On one hand, I have guns in my home.  Being a police officer affords some necessity to be armed and protect myself coming to and from work.  As a result, I have a safe with several firearms I've accumulated over the years.  And in a sporting sense, I do enjoy target shooting with my friends.  So from the Second Amendment perspective, I don't want any external entity telling me I cannot have guns.   On the other side of the issue, I have seen firsthand what depression and access to firearms can achieve.  I have been to suicides, homicides, and accidental deaths involving firearms and those suffering from depression, schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders.  In this argument, I support gun violence restraining orders and the penal code section prohibiting weapons if someone is a danger to themselves or others.   So this one, for me, is a hard answer.  I want it both ways.  I want to have the registry to protect others, but I don't want anyone to touch my guns or put me in the registry.  This kind of hypocrisy is the very reason we get into trouble.  "
722,"The most important problem to fix is public perception and comfortability regarding PWMI.  At the end of Crystal Dieleman's talk, she said it best.  People need to feel they are socially accepted.  We, as humans, long for social interactions and connections.  The more we isolate those PWMI, the more likely they are to engage in mental illness behaviors and possibly violence.  As we heard in both the lecture and the TED video, NIMBY is the biggest blockage in the system.   We all understand, conceptually, that treating people with dignity and respect, giving them a home, structure, autonomy, employment, and relationships are the strongest indicators of successful inclusion.  However, we thinking of it existentially.  We recognize the hypothesis, but we do not want to be immersed in its execution.  We do not want to live next door to community-supported housing for the mentally ill.  This is such an issue that if you were to have a house next door to you, you would have to disclose it when selling your own home.  Often, it would be a deterrent for your potential buyers, as well.  If we can normalize the idea of mental illness and take away the stigma, we might be able to take the first steps to ""fix"" this problem.  According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, ~20% of adults experience mental illness each year.  Only one to two percent of the population has red hair.  We are less afraid of redheads than we are of those who suffer from mental illness.  Yet redheads are 10 times rarer and just as likely to commit violent crime.  I truly believe this is an education issue.  People just don't know how common mental illness really is, and they don't understand it.  People are afraid of things they don't understand.  "
723,"Both the lecture and the book outlined the ebb and flow of society's view on mental health over the ages.  For example, mental illness has been characterized as an imbalance in bodily fluids, demonic possession, immorality, a biological inevitability, and an abnormality in the brain.  Likewise, treatments have varied the gamut from therapy as it's known today to bathing, bleeding, torture, and even death.  The common thread in the historical perspective of mental illness was a lack of humanization.  It wasn't until the last century that we really began to see PWMI as people worthy of humane conditions and individualized treatments.  I say this with trepidation, knowing that even in the last century some facilities had absolutely inhumane conditions.   I was unaware of the history behind mental illness and its initial foray into the law.  I really only knew of the current state of affairs in the intersection between the criminal justice system and PWMI.  For example, I know our homeless population in San Jose has reached an all-time high.  It increased by over 40% over the last two years.  A great number of our homeless population suffers from mental illness.  Our department is now called upon to deal with these individuals.  Yet, being homeless is not illegal.  Having a mental illness is not illegal.  It is clear from the daily calls to 9-1-1 that most people do not see our homeless population as full-fledged members of society.  They are the ""others.""  They are the masses we wish to be hidden from our streets.  We don't want their tents on our corners or their RVs in front of our houses.  We do not see them as people, individuals, with stories.  We see them as a blight.  As a matter of fact, as I am writing this the dispatcher is sending two units to a complaint in which the reporting party wants a man and a woman living in an RV moved from his street.  They have done nothing wrong.  He just wants them ""moved along."" In talking to PWMI and our homeless, they know how they are viewed.  Many have accepted it.  Some resent it.  But seemingly all of them recognize the perception they are not equal to those who live in highrise townhomes or single-home houses in neighborhoods.   I don't know that PWMI will ever be seen equally, at least not in my foreseeable future.  Society is slow to develop and there is no revolutionary conceptual movement to change perceptions.  On the contrary, every mass shooting involves an aspect, how"
724,"Hi Alyse, great post.  Thank you.  I appreciate the way you focused on the Greek and Roman period.  I noticed that, too.  I think it would be interesting to look more at this time.  Did they get it right?  Did they really see PWMI as a part of the family, to be nurtured and cared for within the family structure?  How much of the madness was cared for in and outside the home?  And what did they mean by humane cures and treatments?  Humane is an adjective, subject to perception.  What you and I may belive is appropriate may not be that way in other cultures.   I also like how you mentioned the mental health registry.  I wonder what you think of that.  I might interpret from your phrasing that you do not agree with it.  However, when framed as a registry against firearm possession, would that change your views?  For example, if the mental health registry would be used to limit the purchase and possession of firearms, does that make it more desirable?  Just a few thoughts.  Thanks Alyse.  -Steve"
725,"Hi Danielle,  Great post. Thank you.  I like that you mentioned NIMBY.  I also love that you mentioned Brene Brown.  I've read two of her books.  I just want to address one thing... you reiterated that the people who have the most contact with the mentally ill are less likely to believe they are dangerous.  I think this has ties to the NIMBY argument.   On one hand, I agree that there is an intimacy in getting to know people that allows us to get past our fears of the unknown.  The more time we spend with someone, the less scary they are to us.  The same is true for PWMI.  The more time we spend with them, the more likely we are to understand and embrace them, rather than fear them.  That being said, there is often a NIMBY factor.  The PWMI that people most often fear these days are those who are homeless or have drug problems.  They are unkempt, dirty, and associated with quality-of-life and theft crimes.  These are the people that nobody wants in their back yards.  They are often the overlooked masses that nobody takes the time to get to know.  It's definitely a Catch-22.  Because of their very nature, they bring with them baggage that most people have difficulty getting past.   So, I would have to say, as long as we have the NIMBY perception, we're going to continually miss the opportunity to get past the strangeness and oddities creating fear.  Thereby, we miss the chance to get to know people for who they truly are.   In that way, familiarity and NIMBY are related.  Thanks, Steve"
726,"The President of the United States (POTUS) is supposed to be the spokesperson for the ethical standards of the nation.  They reflect the pulse of the nation and the movement of our focus.  When POTUS talks about mental illness, there can be no higher person in our country bringing the discussion to the forefront of our attention.  I truly appreciate how Barack Obama spoke of mental illness.  He succinctly, and in a manner that is totally digestible to the average person, talked about ending the stigma behind having a mental illness.  The president's voice is powerful.  Their support in a cause like this can speak volumes and move mountains.  "
727,"I think it's relatively self-evident what the general consensus is regarding PWMI when examined through the lens of funding.  Essentially, we put money into things we care about.  As we make cuts to the mental health care system, we are articulating it perceived unnecessariness.  Money is a great barometer of our attention and focus.  If, for example, we increase funding, we are telling the public this is important to us.  Unfortunately, in this case, the inverse is true.  We are cutting and redistributing, therefore we are illustrating a lack of importance.   Mental illness is an existential idea for a lot of people.  It is unseen, unfelt, and unnoticed.  For that reason, there is very little personification.  The general public (although a significant portion will be affected by it) does not really understand its consequences.  As a result, the public apparently feels those who are affected by mental illness are not  worthy of our attention.  It is for that reason, that funding is redistributed these issues go unheard.  "
728,"I actually disagree with this servicemember's accounting of what should be done upon return from the war.  The video demonized the use of psychiatric medication in the treatment of mental illness.  I believe there is a place for both medical and cognitive-behavioral treatment for PTSD, depression, and anxiety.  I've also seen an uptick in EMDR as a treatment.  The psychiatric medications may not eliminate the issue, but they may cover it enough to allow the patient the opportunity to put coping mechanisms into place.  Just ""taking the edge off"" might be enough to create a gap that will allow the veteran an opportunity to eke past the tipping point toward recovery.  Along those lines, I wholeheartedly agree with his assessment that group therapy is a major component of appropriate, long-term treatment.  "
729,"Self-awareness is key to seeking treatment for an illness or condition.  If I am unaware that I am ill or that treatment may cure something that I'm feeling, then there is no drive for me to seek treatment.  If I do not know that hearing voices is unusual or my never-ending sadness is abnormal, I won't seek treatment or help.  It is imperative that those around us help us to see the unusualness of our situation.  Not only those close to us, but society as a whole must have the ability to help us to help ourselves.  I recognize there must be a willingness to change or be treated for success, but without the camera lens facing in, we may not have the ability to recognize what must be changed or treated.  "
730,"Cancer is normal.  It is an unfortunate condition that affects us all.  Cancer, in many cases, can be treated and cured.  There is no stigma, it is not contagious, it is unseen, yet it may be completely debilitating to the individual.  Mental illness is very similar.  We cannot see it (even if we can see its effects), it is not contagious, and it may be debilitating.  Yet, there is a tremendous stigma surrounding mental illness.   Normalcy is learned.  It is taught from a young age and carries throughout one's life.  As such, we should be teaching that the same way cancer affects people, mental illness affects people.  We have a responsibility to those suffering from mental illness to remove the stigma surrounding their condition.  I truly believe we should be talking about mental illness in biology classes throughout our educational continuum.  Just imagine the sensitivity we could develop by helping the general public to understand what happens with mental illness and how the person is affecting, not just how they are different from us.   Early on, elementary schools should teach that it exists, it is normal, and touch on how the body is simply developing differently.  It is akin to having different color eyes and hair.  The brain is just developing differently.  Then as children proceed into middle and high school, they learn more about the anatomical development.  They learn about chemical imbalances, cortisol levels, neurotransmitters, etc.  They can learn how certain medications affect the distribution or receptions of neurotransmitters, such as MAOIs.  Ultimately, we have taken away the ""weirdness"" of people with mental illnesses.  We have, over the course of an educational career, turned it into something that can be lived with and treated.   I think the hardest thing to really explain will be the coping mechanisms and psycho or social treatments.  They are more existential.  They vary so much from therapist to therapist that it may be challenging to explain.  Perhaps simply defining and explaining the concept of treatment, rather than exploring the depth of their purview would be better suited for pre-collegiate understanding.    "
731,"Hi Danielle, great post!  I especially like two things: criminal justice courses and clubs.  I know it's not really related to mental illness, but what a great idea to have basic CJ courses brought to younger students so they know their rights.  For most kids, it isn't until later in high school and college that they find out they really do have rights that cannot be infringed upon.  I'm all for bringing that to them earlier in life.  The clubs and programs are excellent ideas to erase the isolation and stigma of mental illness.  Kids are diagnosed at younger and younger ages with issues like depression and anxiety.  Having peers suffering from the same or similar situations accessible would speak volumes to the normalcy.  Great call.  The only holdback I have is the idea of ""speaking your truth.""  Kids are mean.  They're downright vicious in middle school.  I've seen firsthand how they will come out of the woodwork to assassinate the character of another student in an effort to gain even a modicum of attention from their peers.  I would hate for the child ""speaking their truth"" to be publicly lambasted because they deviate from the norm.  It's going to be tough to create an environment in which this is not only accepted but encouraged.  Don't get me wrong - I'd like to see this.  I just don't trust that kids right now have the ability not to lash out on each other.   Thanks, Steve  "
732,"Hi Alyse, thank you for your post.  I like what you said about increasing the complexity of the discussion with high school kids.  I didn't even consider the co-occurrence issues when I laid out my plan.  Kids are being exposed to drugs and alcohol in middle school now.  I'd suggest we start there, not waiting for high school.  Granted, we should be more in-depth and more vigorous about our interventions in high school, but we need to start the process at the same time it starts for these kids.   Substance abuse is a sensitive topic at any age.  Perhaps if we take away some of  its stigma, we might be able to have some kids see that they're using it as a crutch for an otherwise treatable condition.  Imagine if we can imprint the concept in the to the mind of a child that drug use is only a way to mask a condition that can be treated long-term with the appropriate medication and therapies.  If nothing else, we could at least help prevent other substance abuse issues inherent with using more dangerous drugs, such as methamphetamine.  Thanks for bringing that up.  -Steve"
733,"Regarding PWMI, sensitivity refers to those who have mental illness and also show to have a mental illness when evaluated by professionals.  Conversely, specificity refers to those who do not have a mental illness and are not diagnosed with one by professionals.  The best way to illustrate how this would look is the following table:       Has a Mental Illness Does not have a Mental Illness   Diagnosed with Mental Illness True positive - both diagnosed with a mental illness and actually has a mental illness False-positive - Does not have a mental illness, but was diagnosed with one   Not Diagnosed with Mental Illness False-negative - Has a mental illness, but was not diagnosed with one True negative - not diagnosed with a mental illness and doesn't have a mental illness  </tbody> </table> Mental illness is unseen.  It's not an easily-identifiable condition like blue eyes or a rash on the skin.  There are no real outward appearances.  In many cases, it can be faked and it can be hidden.  As a result, we need to test for it.  As the video stated, tests don't give us an <em>answer</em>, they give us a <em>result</em>.   When we have someone who as not diagnosed with a mental illness, but actually has one, it can be detrimental to the individual in several ways, not the least of which is not being provided or receiving services.  Without a diagnosis, they will not be pharmacologically treated, hospitalized, or participate in outpatient management. On the other hand, when someone is diagnosed with a mental illness, yet they don't actually have one, they are put into a system of self-fulfilling prophecy.  Often, the patients in this situation enter the mental health system and find themselves labeled or stigmatized without reason.  They are assumed to be needing services and treatments, but do not actually have the mental illness necessitating them.  This takes away from those who truly need them, such as the true positives or the false-negatives above.    "
734,"This  Due Process video was a good, albeit brief debate to watch about whether the involuntary commitment of sex offenders is a good practice.  It was interesting to watch a defense attorney and law professor speak on opposite sides of the issue.   I believe civil commitment for SVPs is not only warranted but necessary for the safety of the public in some, limited circumstances.  I do not believe it should be a broad sweeping brush by which we paint all those who committed a sexual offense.  Rather, I believe those who are unable to control their impulses or discern between right and wrong must be held until such time as they are no longer a threat to society.    "
735,"Inpatient therapy is the most restrictive to the freedom of movement for an individual, therefore it is the most restrictive of their personal liberties.  As such, inpatient therapy has the largest reach of state authority.  Conversely, outpatient therapy does not detain or restrict one's movement. It allows for the most personal freedom and is the shortest governmental reach.  When we talk about inpatient therapy, it is supported by the parens patriae doctrine of the government's responsibility to care for the individual when they are least able to care for themselves.  "
736,"Inpatient (IP) or outpatient (OP), that is the question. We have learned arguments for and against both sides. IP is coercive, anti-therapeutic, stigmatizing, discriminatory, and financially-driven. Yet, despite all that, it is still seen as a means to protect both society and the individual. OP is less restrictive, more flexible, provides for the best societal integration, and has the best rate for medication compliance. Yet, it is often ineffective, underutilized, and still holds stigma and coercion. So, thus far, it’s fair to say we don’t have a perfect system for dealing with PWMI. OP is often required due to the lack of available hospital beds, legislation, and programming. However, that does not mean OP is the best option for every patient. IP may be more effective for some clients, even if they are unable to obtain it right away. I believe the best way to measure the effectiveness of treatment is by standardized measures presented by caseworkers. If, for example, a guy named  Jack Sprat needs mental health services, he should be assigned a caseworker, regardless of whether it’s IP or OP. Then, upon completion of treatment, Jack should be able to meet with his caseworker to determine the effectiveness of the treatment. Without using someone familiar with Jack’s situation, we will not be able to determine progress. This, of course, is a hypothetical scenario because we simply do not have enough caseworkers or funding to be able to track every PWMI that receives IP or OP. As a society, we still shy away from the scariness of PWMI. We are haunted by news stories, active shooters, and allegations of mental illness creating bloodshed. It’s false and misleading, but it sells commercials so people eat it up. I believe this can all be attributed to a lack of understanding and education. As we’ve talked about before, we need to normalize mental illness so we can get past these fictitious ideas that PWMI massacre schoolkids."
737,"Hi Briana,  Thank you for your post.  You very clearly delineated the pros and cons of both IP and OP.  I agree with what you said about normalizing mental illness.  I also mentioned this in my post.  I would expect that the more we make PWMI feel they are just like everyone else, the less stigma would surround their individual afflictions.  Consequently, having less stigma would open them up to more treatment options, even if those treatments were within the public's sight.   I also appreciated that you mentioned evaluation at the beginning, middle, and end.  I only talked about before and after.  I like your idea of having a median measurement as well.   If, for example, something isn't working.  That mid-point would allow the therapist to pivot, hopefully providing better care for the patient.   Thanks again,  Steve"
738,"Hi Jennifer,  Thanks for your post.  Something you said got me thinking... You were talking about someone who is a danger to themselves.  Often, in law enforcement, this comes up as they told someone that they wanted to kill themselves.  Then, the police are called, we arrive, and we ask them if they want to hurt themselves.  The answer, almost always, is, ""No.""  This puts the police in a difficult position.  On one hand, the victim (that's what we'll call them) told someone they wanted to commit suicide.  On the other hand, when the police got there, for whatever reason, they no longer want to do it.  Should the police leave them there in the hope that they won't get the idea in their head again?  Should the police even believe them, because they could very well be lying?  Whose responsibility is it to provide for their safety and well-being.   Today, regardless of whether or not the victim tells  an officer they want to die, if they told someone else, the police will take them into custody.  Often, this is motivated by the idea that there is liability if the officer walks away and the person kills themselves.  The question will be asked, ""Could they have been saved?""   It's sad to think of it in terms of civil liability, rather than the best thing for the individual.  The compass is not calibrated correctly in this example.  Yet, the best thing did happen for the individual, even if it was not motivated correctly.   Thanks, Steve"
739,"I would say the first three stages are the most difficult for PWMI to navigate.  In Stage 1, they are being interviewed by law enforcement.  Often, they may not know their rights and may be subject to investigation beyond their understanding.  In Stage 2, they begin the court process.  It's a difficult process to navigate, even for educated, non-challenged individuals.  PWMI would struggle greatly to comprehend the process and nuances.  Then, during the criminal proceedings in Stage 3, they are appearing before judges and juries.  The pressure is great and the rules are infinite and detailed.  Therefore, I would say that all of the first three stages would be incredibly problematic for PWMI."
740,"As the responsibility for housing inmates shifts from prisons to county jails, PWMI may receive more individualized attention.  There are 110 county jails in California, but only 33 prisons.  Purely looking at the numbers, if each facility has some sort of mental health services, inmates are more likely to have an opportunity to receive those services in individualized treatment.  In addition, PWMI may be able to avoid incarceration in the first place by the reduction of non-violent, non-serious drug and property felonies to misdemeanors.  Therefore, theoretically, realignment, Prop 47, and Prop 57 may have some benefits for PWMI. On the other hand, one of the major concerns after Prop 47 was that the people who would normally receive treatment in jail for drugs or mental health problems would no longer be able to receive that treatment because their offenses would not put them in jail.  If someone afflicted by MI no longer had access to medications and treatments they received within the penal system, that could be extremely detrimental to their well-being.  Therefore, the propositions and realignment could have some significant negative impacts for PWMI.  "
741,"Fairness isn't the issue.  Police are the first responders because people cal 9-1-1.  That's not going to change anytime soon.  Even the fire department won't enter a scene until law enforcement makes it safe.  I think the question we need to ask is if police are provided all the tools, training, and resources necessary to be the first responders to PWMI.  Within the last five years, I would say that my Department (San Jose POlice) can answer that question with a resounding, ""Yes.""  (1) Every officer, regardless of tenure, is required to go through the CIT academy.  (2) Every officer, regardless of tenure, is required to go through de-escalation training.  (3) Every event involving a PWMI will have less-lethal options on scene.  (4) Every event involving PWMI will notify mobile mental health and have them either on standby or en route.  (5) Every event will be dealt with according to a  Tactical Conduct policy utilizing resources, cover, distance, time, and negotiation.  Despite my Department's progressive approach to PWMI, it is not something that is universal throughout the county, much less the state or the nation.  "
742,"Stigma is the attitude one has toward PWMI.  By putting officers through a week-long training on PWMI, their signs, symptoms, treatments, and stigmas, officers are being taught to understand and relate, rather than to judge.  Just the fact an officer gets to experience, first hand, what it's like to have a mental illness alleviates some of the stigmas.  Then providing them with tools and procedures that de-escalate situations will equip officers with more knowledge and understanding, rather than exacerbating preconceived notions and attitudes.  "
743,"The Taheri article suggested Crisis Intervention Teams (CITs) may be a ""blindly adopted novelty.""  While this is a bit of an inflammatory statement, Taheri went on to discuss her findings.  There is insufficient evidence of several claims promoting CITs.  For example, whether or not they reduce the use of force, arrests, or officer injuries.  Taheri called for more research, particularly focusing on outcomes.   I think an underlying issue here is that CIT requires training.  In that training officers spend time talking to PWMI, simulating being affected by PWMI in a police encounter, and studying signs, symptoms, treatments, and medications.  It is a tremendous class bringing information and light to a huge issue in law enforcement.  So, inherently, CIT classes reduce stigma and bring understanding to those who have the most common contact with PWMI.   I would argue that despite the lack of proven effectiveness, I still want to see officers trained in CIT.  Having attended the class, I know how useful it is to be equipped with more knowledge and understanding.  As Taheri suggested, we should study ways in which to make CIT more effective.  It is not a matter of eliminating CIT - it is a matter of improving it.  "
744,"Hi Briana,  Thanks for your post.  We said a lot of the same things.  I agree that CIT should continue, but we should definitely look at finding best practices for improving the program.  I appreciate what you said about stigma.  I glanced over that in my post.  You're correct in that this is a big issue with PWMI.  Stigma can be a huge detractor from successfully navigating an event in which mental illness is a factor.  During CIT there is one part of the class I'd like to describe.  A (trainee) officer sits in a chair, in a room.  Three other officers stand behind them.  Each of the standing officers has a narrative they say, whispering into the sitting officer's ear.  Another (trainee) officer has to come into the room and deal with the sitting officer.  As this happens, the voices get louder.  The students get to both experience what it is like to have schizophrenia and experience what it's like trying to deal with someone who has schizophrenia.  It's an excellent exercise.  After this part of the class, it's nearly impossible not to empathize (even if only a little) with someone suffering from mental illness.  If nothing else, this exercise takes away the stigma that often manifests when seeing someone talk to themselves in response to the voices in their head.  Thanks, Steve  "
745,"Hi Alyse,  Great post.  Thank you.  I like that you touched on de-escalation.  Our Department has really put a huge effort into creating an environment of de-escalation.  We are training every single officer in the Department in the Crisis Intervention Team course.  So far, about 80% have gone through the class.  Every new officer has to go through the CIT training before they get out of the academy.  On top of that, we have a written de-escalation policy we call ""Tactical Conduct.""  For this policy, we have to abide by five things:   (1) You must have a core transaction  (a detention or some kind of law violation) before you use any force.  (2) You must have a level of urgency that the suspect presents a credible threat of immediate physical harm to someone before you use any force.  (3) If possible, you must conduct a threat assessment using all reasonable means of gathering information to determine if there are other ways to address the issue without using force.  (4) If possible, you must use cover, concealment, distance, and time to try to avoid using force.   (5) You must request a CIT officer respond if there is any indication the suspect may be mentally ill. Theoretically, by following these procedures, you will mitigate or avoid using force.  I don't know what the statistical results are after this policy was enacted.  I do know, however, that it has brought options to the forefront of our minds on how to avoid using force.  I hear officers ask for CIT or identify themselves as CIT on every call in which there is any indication, whatsoever, that force might be used or mental illness might be an issue.  Merely by making the line officers think about this has helped to slow things down.  We now have officers stage, waiting for additional units.  We have them develop plans and gather intelligence when time allows.  Ultimately, this has been a great addition to our policies and procedures. Thanks, Steve"
746,"I can't imagine the frustration and exasperation felt by these repetitive inmates.  They enter for minor offenses, often perpetrated in an effort to sustain the individual or a drug habit.  Then they are briefly assessed, treated, and kicked right back out onto the street with little or no support network in place.  It is mind-boggling that we have inmates in and out of jail hundreds of times.  Something is indisputably wrong with the system.  There is no way this can be good for the patient in the long term.  "
747,"Indicators for mental health measurement need to be specific, measurable, and comparable.  As such, I believe the following would be good measurements for jail inmates:    The overall number of times incarcerated Length of the periods between incarcerations Violence index of the offending charge Past clinical diagnoses Pharmacological treatment history Current pharmacological treatment(s), if any Offenses or disturbances while incarcerated Weight (before, during, and upon exit) APA-approved Depression Measurement APA-approved Anxiety Measurement APA-approved Drug and Alcohol Measurement </ul> I suppose I could go on for a long time.  These are merely indicators that might be able to give us a glimpse into the effectiveness of treatment and the services provided at the jail facilities.  It is, by no means, a determination about sound ways to house and treat those with mental illness."
748,"I think that prisoners gave up their rights when they were convicted.  It's hard for me to fathom the idea that after a prisoner has committed an intentional act, victimizing someone else, taking away their rights, then we must work hard to preserve the rights of the prisoner.  It's hypocritical.  The victim didn't have the choice not to be violated.  So, perhaps if we say this is a choice - to commit crimes and victimize others - we can say the prisoner has voluntarily given up their rights.  Sometimes, I think too many rights are afforded to prisoners.  Let's take one small example: the freedom of religion.  Prisoners are allowed to hold rituals, wear clothing, and possess religious artifacts based on their freedom of religion.  Yet when you enter the military, you don't have those rights.  If you are a Muslim male in the US military, you cannot wear a kufi.  You have a uniform, a standard.  If we don't allow Muslim males serving our country to express themselves in this manner, why then are we allowing it for those who have victimized others? "
749,"I think, unfortunately, this is a simple answer.  While it's the most expensive, it's also the easiest.  Medications are hands-off.  They require very little staff intervention, and they are quick and easy to administer.  In higher doses, many medications also make the inmates more docile.  If you have an inmate who is acting out and you can administer some lithium to calm them down, rather than have them sit and talk to a psychologist for an hour, you'd be better suited for the faster, easier solution.  "
750,"Here’s what we know: Jails are overcrowded. They’re underfunded and understaffed. There are approximately 615,000 people incarcerated in local jails in the US (Prison Policy Initiative, 2018). Estimates of those with mental illness vary widely within the jail population. Some estimates are as low as 6% and some are as high as 24% (Torrey, Kennard, Eslinger, Lamp, & Pavle, 2010). As a result, we are looking at, roughly, between 37,000 and 147,000 jail inmates with serious mental illness (SMI). Those with SMI have difficulty functioning in smaller, more confined spaces. Jails are more chaotic, smaller facilities, and often rely on dorm-like housing. PWMI have difficulty with unpredictable environments where there is little support and programs for those with mental illness. In county jails, felons are housed with misdemeanants. Theoretically, someone who is in jail for stealing $20 in food from Trader Joes can be housed in a cell with a gang member who stabbed someone. PWMI tend to commit more misdemeanors than felonies. This may be a matter of necessity or a matter of circumstances, but PWMI have more theft and drug charges than violence. Furthermore, inmates entering jail tend to be sicker than those entering prison, particularly with the drug-addicted community. Realignment has dramatically increased the jail population. As such, prisons have less strain on their financial resources, while jails have a higher strain on county resources. Prisons are funded by more generous state correctional budgets, as opposed to county budgets that are forced to rely upon tax revenue and property taxes from their populous. This strain has forced county jails to focus on staffing, housing, and containing inmates, rather than treating them. Programs have gone by the wayside for the ability to incarcerate larger numbers. When taking all the above into account, it is clear to see jails may be inappropriate for housing PWMI, especially when their crimes do not present an ongoing threat to the public."
751,"Operationally, jails are unable to staff the tiers in an appropriate manner to supervise PWMI unless they are in solitary confinement, which we know is detrimental.  It is not uncommon for a jail to have one or two staff in a pod with up to a hundred prisoners.  In that case, there is no way for the staff to recognize when an inmate is in crisis, without that inmate acting out or drawing attention in some way.  A PWMI sitting quietly in their cell, suffering from an acute anxiety attack will easily go unnoticed.  And that is assuming the inmates are all out of their cells, allowing for visual recognition in an open pod.  During lockdowns, when the inmates are in their cells, room checks are done hourly according to Title 15 ( http://www.bscc.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/Adult-Titles-15-Effect-4-1-17.pdf).  A lot can happen in an hour, especially during a mental health crisis.  Architecturally, jails are made to warehouse people.  They are stark, cold, hard, and small.  Cells only 6' wide by 8' long.  In that space is two beds, a toilet, a small desk, and shelves.  The items are made from steel and concrete.  We know that PWMI do not like confined spaces, where their symptoms are often exacerbated.  Now, imagine being locked in a cell that's only 48 sq ft for 23-hours a day.  That would cause anyone to struggle.  One of the often-overlooked architectural issues is sound.  In a jail or prison, it's loud.  The steel and concrete do not absorb sound.  Therefore, it can be incredibly loud when people are talking, yelling, singing, or making any noise whatsoever.  Compound that on a PWMI and it can be infuriating.  Voices in one's head ring louder to be heard over the noise.  Altogether, the architecture is not designed for PWMI, it's designed for safety and security only. "
752,"Hi Clara,  Great post.  Thank you.  I looked for your post because I wanted to see if you gave any indication about what you thought about realignment.  I know our local jail grew substantially in population during realignment.  So much so that we built another facility and moved more people out of downtown into our satellite facility.  In Santa Clara County we have a main jail downtown.  That has two sides - the ""old"" jail and the ""new"" jail.  We also have a satellite facility we call Elmwood.  Elmwood is for long-term, medium-to-low risk offenders.  They stay in pods with open doors the majority of the day.  They are allowed to freely move about the pod.  Yard time is allowed every day, but it's limited to ensure the pods are kept separate.   Downtown the ""old"" jail has some nasty old solitary cells and mostly dorm-like cells.  Rather than keep the individual cells up, the jail made some modifications to keep the inmates in larger groups, 20 or 30 to a room.  The ""new"" jail is where we put people with SMI.  We have a floor dedicated to housing mentally ill patients.  They have 15-minute room checks, we have safety rooms, food is brought to them, and they are provided counseling and medical services as needed.  We have on-site psychiatrists and counselors who work there 24-7.  I think they're doing a (relatively) good job with PWMI at our jail, all things considered.  Sure, there are problems as we've seen throughout the penal system.  But, for the most part, they're doing what they can.   Thanks, Steve"
753,"Hi Karen,  Thanks for your post.  I thought it was really interesting.  One thing you said - that PWMI should be treated in their own facilities - got me thinking.  I found some statistics in my research before my post.  With 615,000 people incarcerated in jails (Prison Policy Initiative, 2018) and between 6% and 25% suffering from mental illness, we are looking at between 37,000 and 147,000 people.  I'm not sure our infrastructure has the ability to create new facilities just to house this population.  While I completely agree with you in theory, I think practice may be another story.  We would need to find land, build structures, inject new technologies, staff for security, and staff for treatment.  The costs, time, and resources necessary would likely overwhelm the penal system.   Rather than find or build new facilities, could we just retrofit the ones we have?  Imagine if we save on the ground-up construction costs to divert those funds into redesign and remodeling.  Could we structure existing facilities in a manner that would be more appropriate for PWMI?   In addition, we could provide funding for training and hiring of professional staff.  Every jail could have on-site psychiatrists for pharmacology and psychologists to oversee counseling.  Each tier could have an on-site counselor familiar with the inmates, their needs, and their diagnoses.   I know it's a pipe-dream, but with enough people pushing for change, it might just work.  Thanks, Steve"
754,"Risk assessment tools are not 100% accurate, but they are at least a benchmark to begin the analysis of risk assessment.  In order to really understand whether or not someone poses a risk to the community, one must look at the totality of the circumstances.  What was the crime they committed?  What kind of threat did it pose to the community?  What kind of work have they done since the incident to improve themselves or ensure this does not happen again?  What kind of support networks do they have in place?   Once we begin to build an overall picture of the individual, their environment, and their circumstances, we can compare that information against the risk assessment tools.  Essentially, no single part of the investigation is definitive.  It is all information that must be weighed against the entire investigation to determine an outcome.   I believe ""fairness"" is not an issue.  It is a matter of conducting a comprehensive investigation involving all aspects of the individual's life now and the events or experiences all the way back to the incident.  Once we have that information, it is evaluated to determine if this person poses an ongoing risk to the public.  "
755,"The RNR approach focuses on higher-risk offenders' criminogenic needs.  In other words, it focuses on those risk factors that can be changed such as antisocial personalities, behaviors, cognition, and associations.  In addition, it focuses on family discord, work and school performance, leisure and recreation activities, and substance abuse.  These factors have been found to have the most effect on recidivism rates, as well as being the ablest to be changed or treated.  I would imagine mental health professionals would embrace this idea.  By applying cognitive-behavioral therapies, they would have the largest impact on the recidivism of PWMI.  It appears to me, at first glance, that if we are effective in treating the symptoms, the resulting illnesses would be kept within a range that coping mechanisms could be employed.   Regarding other risk factors in the community, I would worry about:    Financial stability Criminal associations or environments Social bonding and social-emotional ties to the community Stress levels or personal sources of stress for the individual Employment of coping strategies in small, controlled, measurable environments Long-term planning or goals Individualized small, measurable successes to establish positive patterns Faith-based associations </ul>"
756,"The video was brief and only mentioned probation officers developing individualized case plans as a concrete step toward addressing behavioral issues.  The chief said all the right buzz words with, ""We're criminal justice behavioralists,"" facilitating behavioral change, management, recidivism, etc.  I just didn't see a lot of substance in what he was saying.   Using what I know about probation, particularly in my county, I can say that the probation officers are completely overwhelmed.  They have caseloads far exceeding what a normal person can manage.  Expecting them to develop individualized treatment and service plans for every probationer is incredibly difficult, but may be possible.  Holding their probationers accountable and ensuring they are participating in the programs is not.  There are just not enough hours in the day.   Despite these challenges, probation is definitely a better option than jail.  We know PWMI struggle when they're incarcerated (as we talked about extensively last week).  Keeping them confined, with minimal medical and psychiatric resources places PWMI in an environment in which they are bound for failure and negative outcomes.  Probation, on the other hand, theoretically provides all the resources society has to offer.  But probation takes it a step further in having the ability to require using those services.    Probation officers may make attending counseling, drug treatment, and classes mandatory as a condition of probation.  This makes seeking treatment slightly more requisite than it would be if the PWMI was incarcerated.  "
757,"In this era of 21st Century Policing, we have shifted our mindset to include the treatment of symptoms, not simply the punishment for the act.  In looking at mental health courts, there is a level of giving participants a voice that you don't normally see in the criminal justice system.  Participants are able to speak with judges, social workers, and probation officers that are better equipped to understand their individual problems.  Diagnoses do not carry peculiarity or stigma that they would normally carry in a courtroom.  Behaviors that are dismissed or misunderstood are now able to be interpreted as symptoms.   If I had a mental illness and found myself involved with the criminal justice system, I would much rather have the ability to participate in a mental health court process.  Merely through their focus on therapy and treatment, I will be better off then if I were to be housed and stored in a jail or prison.  In addition, mental health courts utilize services throughout the community.  As we have seen, mental health services in the penal system are limited, overstretched, and rarely effective.  "
758,"Chief,  The purpose of this email is to address our new risk-need-responsivity (RNR) plan regarding the supervision of probationers with mental illness.  I read a study by Skeem, Steadman, and Manchak (2015) that provides an excellent analysis of our pending RNR program.  A copy is attached to this email.  Below is a synopsis of the information I learned.   Need (1) Approximately 2M people suffering from acute mental illness are incarcerated annually.  (2) The majority of those incarcerated with mental illness also have substance abuse disorders.  (3) The RNR model addresses the risk factors associated with recidivism.  (4) Those risk factors are broken down into two categories: substance abuse and antisocial behaviors.  (5) Theoretically, by addressing substance abuse and antisocial behaviors, we will substantially reduce the risk of recidivism in our probationary population.  Support (1) Programs targeting psychiatric issues are more effective when used in combination with risk factor treatment.  Alone, our psychiatric outpatient services only go so far.  When we combine them with attacking substance abuse and antisocial behaviors, they should be far more effective.  (2) Antisocial behaviors include individual personality traits, cognition or thinking, personal associations, school and work performance, and recreational activities.  (3) Intensive treatment programs focusing on the highest-risk offenders are the most effective at reducing their recidivism.    Warnings (1) We do not want to trade our outpatient psychiatric program for the RNR model - it is not meant to replace, only to reinforce.  We know there are positive outcomes in our outpatient psychiatric programs already, so we want to enhance these programs with RNR.  (2) Much of the information driving the RNR model is derived from little empirical data.  Essentially, despite the relatively prudent nature of the plan, there are very few studies experimentally substantiating the claims of the RNR model.  (3) When targeting high-risk offenders for intensive treatment, we cannot ignore low- and medium-risk offenders.  If our goal is to improve overall recidivism, while improving the health and welfare of our clientele, we cannot overlook those populations, even if their statistical benefit is low.  (4) Due to th"
759,"Hi Suz,  Great post, thank you.  I appreciate you mentioning symptom control.  I didn't address it in my post.  I've found that the symptoms of mental illness can be so widespread and encompassing that it would be hard to differentiate between a symptom and ""life.""  Allow me to explain... Earlier today I was a little stressed because I feel like I'm a little behind in school.  This week was a tough one for me.  We had an officer-involved shooting in which our special operations Violent Crimes Enforcement Team shot and killed a man.  I was the watch commander when it occurred, so I was in charge of the event.  I had planned on studying that day, but I was completely unable to due to this event.  What that means is I had to finish up this week's work today.   As my wife and I were driving back from our workout, she asked me what my plan was.  I told her how stressed I was and that I needed the day to study.  Before I did, though, we needed to clean the house.  She asked me why I would need to clean the house if I was so stressed and needed to study.  To me, the explanation was simple - I need the house clean so my mind is settled, everything is in order, and I can focus on my classes.  This made perfect sense to me.  My little bit of OCD means I need things in order before I can concentrate.  Chaos unfocuses me when it comes to my school work.  At work, I'm the opposite.  I am calm in the chaos.  I can handle anything - even an officer-involved shooting, with calm and relative ease.  So when you mentioned symptom control, it made me think of this.  I have a coping mechanism I developed at work that allows me to function very well in chaos.  At home, though, I need order.  It's odd, but it's my little bit of symptom control.  When I said before that symptom control can be ""life,"" I mean that it can be indistinguishable from the appearance of normal functioning.  Most people would never have any idea about the settling or unsettling nature of chaos and order in my life. For them, they just see me handling things at work or tidying up at home.  It's only when I explain it that my normal ""life"" activity has value in the scheme of mental illness.  Thanks, Steve   "
760,"Hi Asia,  Thanks for your post.  I liked your clear explanation of what the RNR model is.  As a matter of fact, I copied it and pasted it into my notes for this week.  Great job.   In point #1 you mentioned that ""comparably few crimes are directly driven by symptoms of mental disorders."" While this may be true, it does not, necessarily, determine the usefulness of the RNR model.  The idea that crimes are not  driven by mental illness does not mitigate the fact that mental illness is a contributing factor to the commission and prosecution of crime.  This is illustrated by the prevalence of mental illness in penal institutions.  Comparatively speaking, there is a much higher incidence of mental illness in jail than in the general population of society.  This, in and of itself, should indicate the relationship between mental illness and the criminal justice system.  In point #2 you said, ""The RNR model may have different outcomes when applied to PWMI and persons without mental illness.""  What are those different outcomes?  How do they play into the applicability or needs of an RNR model?  What differentiation must be applied to ensure the outcomes are comparable between PWMI and persons without mental illness at the conclusion of an RNR treatment plan?  In point #3 you said, ""Rehabilitation is vital to helping PWMI function in the community after arrest.""  You reiterated this statement later in your explanation by saying, ""Rehabilitation in the community is one of the key solutions to reducing recidivism rates.""  Generally speaking, we know this.  Without rehabilitation, recidivism rates will not reduce.  What rehabilitation are you talking about?  Its about substance abuse?  Mental illness?  Rehabilitation programs while incarcerated?  Social service programs?  Social adaptability therapy?    As a Chief of a Probation Department, you would have to explain a lot more to help me to understand the RNR model, what it does, why we need it, what we should look out for, and how we could implement it.   Thanks, Steve"
761,"I watched the video from this lecture and another one about Rikers Island that was in the sidebar on YouTube when this video played.  I thought it was interesting that both videos talked about how psychologically damaging prison can be.   When we have PWMI in a prison environment, they are confined to a small, bleak cell.  There is no positive intellectual stimulation. They are surrounded by violence and noise and confusion.  PWMI do not get appropriate psychological services, no long-term counseling or therapies to reduce symptoms.  The medication is designed to be the treatment, to make warehousing PWMI easier for the staff and guards.  Solitary confinement is meant to remove stimulus, yet it only creates an environment of more aggravating stimuli.  People are yelling, but not talking.  There the rooms are painted, but they're bland.  There is furniture and facilities, but they're sterile and cold.  Privileges are taken away and prisoners are subjected to violent physical altercations with jail guards.  Essentially, it seems that every negative hindrance to appropriate treatment is invoked.  "
762,"I understand the theoretical purpose of incarceration is to correct behavior (rehabilitate) and establish a standard.  But, I also know this is not a reality.  In California, our recidivism rate is approximately 65% meaning 65 out of 100 inmates will return to prison within three years of their release.  So, even in the best of circumstances, we fail the majority of the time.  When you compound this with mental illness, I would imagine the number of rehabilitated prisoners drops significantly.  Mental illness is not temporary.  People (usually) have it their entire lives.  It may be treated, coped with, or kept at bay, but it's still there.  We are never going to rehabilitate those with mental illness, particularly in the current prison environment.  We have discussed so many of the detrimental aspects of prison on PWMI.  Everything inside from the environment to treatment to staffing and facilities contributes to the negative outcomes.  I think rehabilitation is a pipe dream, especially when it comes to PWMI.  "
763,"Solitary confinement is a catch-22.  On one hand, you will often have inmates you need to separate from the general population.  Perhaps they are violent or they are preying on others.  For whatever the reason, you need to provide for the safety of the rest of the prisoners, so they must be separated.  When that happens, placing them in a cell alone becomes a necessity.  There is a lot that happens in prison for gaining and relinquishing power.  When power is taken away by incarceration, exploitation by guards, or exploitation by other inmates, it must be regained somehow.  Often, that manifests as the victimization of the weaker.  It is the government's responsibility to provide for their safety, then, rather than allow inmates to regain power through violence.   Conversely, we know how incredibly detrimental to the psyche solitary confinement is.  Inmates feel a loss of control, depression, anxiety, and signs of psychosis.  They have cognitive issues, memory difficulties, and sometimes hallucinations.   Knowing the deleterious effects, one must weigh the need to provide for the safety of the group against the negative outcomes for the individual.  Each case must be looked at on its face, taken in context with the totality of the circumstances.  By weighing these dichotomous issues, we might be able to see whether solitary confinement is necessary or unnecessary.  "
764,"I have absolutely no problem with my tax dollars going to treating mental illness in prison.  We need prisons to keep the populous safe.  PWMI are in prison.  It is our responsibility to provide for the safety and welfare of those we incarcerate.  Therefore, it is our responsibility to fund the services needed by PWMI in prison.  It's a simple issue for me.  I would never want to withhold necessary treatment or services from anyone, even those who have made mistakes landing themselves in prison.  "
765,"There are, essentially, three stages of incarceration when we look at PWMI: coming in, while they're in, and when they leave.   Entering prison, intake, is when PWMI are evaluated for threat level and risk assessment.  Here begin the diverging goals of the prison system.  On one hand, the prison must warehouse the individuals assigned to it, keeping them safe, fed, and healthy for the length of their terms.  While in custody, it is the government's responsibility to provide for the needs of the individuals within their care.  However, sometimes the needs of the individual diverge from the needs of the prison.  For example, PWMI need medications and treatment for their conditions.  Much like a diabetic entering an institution, the government must provide the necessary tools to survive their ailment.  This intake period is when the needs are identified.  Prisoners are given classification ratings and treatment needs are apprised.  The Adams and Ferrandino (2008) article discussed how these determinations are made: by clinical analysis or by actuarial assessment.   Intake is the first place prisons can make some positive changes without increasing costs.  Banks and colleagues (2004) were cited in Adams and Ferrandino (2008) as having developed a multitest approach to actuarial risk.  They scored prisoners on a battery of instruments, finding this method to be more precise at predicting risk.  Perhaps by changing our approach to risk assessment during intake, prisons might be able to maintain the same cost and time, while increasing precision and depth.   While inside, prisoners are provided various levels of treatment including group therapy, individual therapy, counseling, and pharmacological management.  As illustrated in our textbook, departments of corrections spend a significant portion of their budgets on psychotropic medications for the treatment of PWMI in prison (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson (2013).  That cost cannot, necessarily, be reduced.  Imagine if we were to withhold a portion of necessary medical treatment for mental illness for a budgetary constraint.  Not only would the liability be ridiculous, but the social backlash would be unfathomable.  Yet, we do this every day by missing the other portion of treatment necessary for PWMI - psychotherapy.   The second place I think we should spend money to save money is in cognitive-behavioral therapy.  We have discussed several times this quarter, in the l"
766,"Hi Janae,  Thanks for your post.  When you talked about community-based resources, were you talking about using them inside the prison system our outside?  Are you talking about state-managed post-release programs or programs that are owned and operated by the community but come into the prison to support the state programs?   You also talked about focusing funds on creating community-based programs.  It sounds like what you're talking about here is more of a state-funded post-release program.  I thought that was an interesting idea.  Often, we rely on community programs run by community-based organizations, sometimes partially funded by state grants or investment, to support inmates after release from prison.  These need to meet some mandated requirements, but they are able to establish their own protocols and criteria for services.  For this reason, they are often faith-based or related to a faith-based organization.   I wonder how this would look if the post-release programs were completely state-funded.  What do you think?  -Steve"
767,"Hi Suz,  I totally appreciate what you said about increasing funding and keeping medication for PWMI in prison.  I had an analogy for this... Imagine an inmate enters prison with diabetes.  Their at-home daily dose of insulin was 100 mg.  Let's say that 100 mg costs the prison $5 per day.  However, if the prison only provides 90 mg of insulin, they can save 50 cents a day.  It's only 10 mg less.  The inmate should be fine, they probably won't feel great, but they'll survive.  The objective, after all, is to do the most good for the most people and saving that 50 cents per day can become a lot of money.  Over the course of a 10-year sentence, it adds up to $1,825.  Ultimately, (a) the inmate is receiving treatment, even though it's not, necessarily, the treatment they need; (b) the prison is providing the treatment, keeping the prisoner alive and relatively healthy; and (c) the prison is saving money that may be spent elsewhere in the budget to improve the system for other inmates.   This is how the prison system sees mental health.  Sure, they can spend more money on mental illness treatment, but what do they ultimately get out of it?  I hope that as people like us continue to educate ourselves on the benefits of mental health treatment, lowering recidivism rates, and long-term solutions to short-term problems, we are able to positively affect the prison system.  Once wardens really understand that the little investment now creates a better system later, our prison system might just improve. Thanks, Steve"
768,"If I was a taxpayer in Missouri, knowing what I know about PWMI and incarceration, I would wholeheartedly support the construction of the new facility.  However, I think that might only be because we've studied this.  If I was a normal Missouri resident, without a deeper understanding of PWMI, I would probably wonder, ""Why do we need this?""  The messaging from the state would need to explain to me what the need is for a new state-of-the-art facility.  They would have to show me why the old facility no longer works.  If they only talk about techniques and practices, I would wonder why those techniques and practices cannot be accomplished in the old facility.  Perhaps I am a skeptic, but if I did not know much about PWMI, you'd have a tougher time selling me on the idea of a new facility at such a high cost to taxpayers. "
769,"Absolutely not.  The NGRI defense is not a ""get out of jail free card.""  First, it is rarely used in less than one percent of cases.  Even when it is used, it is only successful a fraction of the time.  There are several standards by which NGRI is judged, including the M'Naughten rule, the Durham rule, and most-recently under the Comprehensive Crime Control Act (1984).  As it stands now in federal courts, the defendant must show through ""clear and convincing evidence"" they were unable to understand the nature and quality of their acts at the time of the acts (18 USC 17).  Even if one is able to achieve the NGRI decision, they are often kept in custody as long as the maximum amount of time prescribed by the committing offense.  Therefore, even in the rarest of circumstances, NGRI causes one to be committed for longer than they would have received in the event of a standard guilty conviction.  "
770,"Safety is a huge issue in these facilities.  Remember, approximately 90% of the patients have committed a crime, often a violent crime, resulting in the necessity to hold them in a facility.  Not only did they show a propensity for violence at some point, but this is exacerbated by mental illness.  Treatment and security need to go hand-in-hand in these facilities.  The best way to ensure this happens is adequate staffing, safety procedures, training, and funding.  It's sad to say, but everyone is always ""short-staffed and underfunded.""  I used the terms ""everyone"" and ""always"" because in all my years in law enforcement, I have never heard anyone say, ""We have plenty of people and plenty of money.""  Regardless, I think it is important to divert resources to the most-needed areas.  These facilities have a difficult job, in dangerous circumstances.  It is imperative to provide the staff with adequate support, training, and tools to do their jobs.  "
771,"This is fantastic.  In patients with deep depression, untreatable by conventional means, this is providing a light at the end of the tunnel.  I recognize it is not a universal cure, as it is not working in all patients.  But as technology develops and we begin to understand the effect of brain stimulation, we are able to treat conditions that are often untreatable.  I know someone who has used this for Parkinson's and it was immensely successful.  I love the idea that we are developing an ability for patients to have some sort of recourse when conventional treatments don't work.  I cannot imagine the depth of the pain Edie felt for all those years.  I love the ways she explained it - that it does not cause her joy, but it gives her the ability to experience joy.  "
772,"Historically, state mental hospitals used to exclusively be occupied by the mentally ill, outside the criminal justice system (Fisher, Geller and Pandiani, 2009).  Over time, however, their demographics have shifted to include those with histories of incarceration or arrest (Fisher, Geller, & Pandiani, 2009).  Concurrently, the number of available psychiatric beds in mental hospitals disappeared by more than 90% (Sisti, Segal, and Emanuel, 2015).  Today, state mental hospitals are used primarily for forensic patients.  90% of state hospital occupants are forensic patients who have committed a crime and are now held pending, in lieu of, or subject to their trial.  The question at hand is whether or not state hospitals should be used almost exclusively for this purpose.   Over this quarter we have talked about deinstitutionalization and transinstitutionalization, both of which contribute to the growing penal population in mental hospitals. It is important to recognize that mental hospitals are more used as a pseudo-prisons, rather than treatment facilities.  They are designed and constructed to house mentally ill patients, in a secure facility, with limited programs.  State hospitals are underfunded, understaffed, and decaying.  They are not, necessarily, appropriate for non-criminal mental health treatment.   I would argue that criminals should be separated from those who have not committed any crime.  Those who have victimized others, but suffer from MI, should be housed in facilities meant to protect the public.  At the same time, we should be providing treatment, medication, and therapies designed not just to maintain, but to alleviate the mental illness.  Patients who have committed no crime, but are a danger to themselves or others should be housed in different facilities altogether.  They, too, should be provided with treatment, medication, and therapies for their mental illnesses.  Yet, their treatment and housing should be kept separate from those who were placed into the facilities against their own accord - those from the criminal justice system.    "
773,"Hi Caroline,  Great post!  I appreciate that you included the Title IX Patients' Rights.  I had never read those, so it was interesting to see what they were.  Thank you.   In reading your post, I can see you would like State Hospitals to exclusively treat PWMI from the criminal justice system.  You cited good reasoning for this.  However, I have a question... what about those who need to be committed against their will, for their own good?  What do we do with them?   In California, we have 5150 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.  It says, in short, that those who are a danger to themselves, danger to others, or gravely disabled, are to be confined for a period of 72 hours for evaluation.  At the end of that evaluation, if they are no longer a threat, they may be released.   Imagine we have a patient, who is schizophrenic, and the voices are telling them to kill people.  The patient can no longer keep the voices at bay and now believes they must kill others in order to silence the voices.  This person is, clearly, a danger to others.  They have not committed a crime yet, so they cannot be convicted and subjected to the criminal justice system that would detain them.  However, we have an obligation to protect the public.  As such, we need to keep them in custody until such time as they are treated and are no longer a threat to the public.  The time period they are held could be indefinite, depending on the success of treatments and future evaluations.  Without state hospitals, we would not be able to do this.   I supposed I'm concerned that if we determine state hospitals to only be used for those within the criminal justice system, we would have no state-sponsored means by which to provide for the public safety outside a criminal act.  I recognize it is a small percentage of PWMI, but it still needs to be an option. Thanks, Steve"
774,"Hi Serenity,  It appears great minds think alike.  You and I said much of the same, but yours was far more eloquent.  We both believe state hospitals should not be exclusive to the criminal justice system - that there are situations in which some people may need to be in a long-term treatment facility, but they never committed a crime.   Over the course of this program, we've talked about SVPs several times - in evaluation, treatment, and now incarceration.  I find it to be so interesting that someone may be convicted, serve their time in prison, get out, and immediately transfer to a mental institution in which they may be held indefinitely.   I remember one case, in particular, in which I interviewed a serial rapist.  He was in an institution, where he was being held on criminal charges, but would soon be up for parole.  During our conversation, he told me he should never be let out.  He was very candid about the fact that he was unable to control his impulses.  If given the opportunity, he would rape again.  It was an absolutely surreal conversation.  He spoke without malice or treachery - just very matter-of-fact.  He would rape more women if he ever got out.  I later transferred out of the unit and never found out what happened to him.  I can only hope he was confined to civil commitment as an SVP.   The entire idea of SVPs being confined civilly seems backward to me.  Why transfer them at all?  They aren't really being treated and they aren't really getting out of the program.  So why are we not just leaving them where they are?  I may be cynical, but if we're never going to let them out, and they're not going to be treated, why do we need to move them to a nicer facility at all?  Thanks, Steve"
775,"Data sharing is paramount to providing comprehensive services to PWMI within the justice system.  I recognize there are privacy, HIPAA, ethical, and CJ issues that play into information sharing, yet without it, we are blindly warehousing individuals.  Imagine if we were able to flag anyone coming into jail or prison with a mental health diagnosis needs level similar to their threat level.  Everyone entering a facility is categorized according to their dangerousness, or threat level.  When that happens, their housing, roommates or dormmates, and privileges are determined based on a matrix.  We could then determine how quickly, how often, in what manner, and with what medication the PWMI should be provided mental health assessment and treatment.  Higher-need individuals see a psychologist or psychiatrist faster than lower-need individuals.   All this information, though, must be shared between institutions, nationally.  We cannot silo the information within only one facility, one county, or one state.  So, to answer the question, no, I do not think the described information is satisfactory.  We need more.  We need to know everything about the individual, their treatment histories, and their needs.  To improve it, we should develop and utilize a system described above - some kind of nationwide clearinghouse of information similar to NCIC, but for mental health rather than criminal behavior.  "
776,"Obviously, I have a unique perspective in this, being that I am both law enforcement and I am CIT-trained.  I've been a CIT officer for a little over 15 years.  In that time, our Department has fully embraced the CIT-mindset.  We put every recruit in the academy through a week-long CIT academy after graduation, before they hit the streets.  In addition, our entire department, including call-takers and dispatchers, are required to go through the CIT training.  In other words, nearly our entire department is CIT-trained.   So, to answer the question, yes, the approach seen in the video is fairly routine.  We all try to tell the subject we're there to help, provide resources, use the least-restrictive methods, etc.  We also incorporate Mobile Mental Health and follow-up services.  "
777,"The reason it takes an outside force is because there are two things cops hate: the way things are, and change. (joke) A police department and a department of corrections are slow-moving ships.  There is so much bureaucracy and so many entrenched procedures to get training or technology that it is often not done because the status quo is the path of least resistance.  I can't tell you how many times over the course of my career that I""ve heard the phrase, ""... because that's the way we've always done it.""  It's infuriating.  When courts get involved and consent decrees from the DOJ come into play, change happens rapidly and with oversight.  They tend to come after a class-action lawsuit shows systemic issues that need to be altered to preserve civil rights.    "
778,"It seems like the mental health care workers from the video figured out how to bridge the correctional gap.  They discussed providing small, attainable goals as well as positive reinforcement for the patients within the CJ system.  I think moving forward they may have trouble with siloing information, developing long-lasting treatment options for post-incarceration, and coordinating outpatient services within the post-release context.  It appears as if safety is not a concern for them - it's something they directly addressed in the video.  So, I would imagine that the cross-training mentioned in the question would be the keystone of this program's success.  If the correctional staff understands the mission and means for the therapeutic staff, and vice-versa for the therapeutic staff understanding the mission and means for the correctional staff, they should be able to succeed in providing safe care while inside a CJ institution.  "
779,"When we think about training, it needs to be all-encompassing and as deep as time will allow.  I believe the understanding needs to be 6"" deep and a mile wide, rather than a mile deep, covering only 6"" of topics.  Below is a list of what training should cover regarding PWMI and the criminal justice system:    Policies, procedures, roles, and responsibilities of all players:  Mental health professionals Law enforcement Judges, district attorneys, and public defenders Jail and prison personnel Parole and probation officers   A broad overview of how PWMI interact with the CJ system. How cultural awareness plays into PWMI and their interaction with the CJ system. Common psychological disorders seen in the CJ system (ex: depression, anxiety, bipolar, schizophrenia, PTSD, etc.) Common neurological, developmental, or cognitive disorders seen in the CJ system (ex: mental retardation, autism spectrum, Alzheimer's, TBI, etc.) Substance abuse, co-occurrence with mental disorders, substance abuse disorders, and how they present. Pharmacology of common medications prescribed for the above-listed disorders. Special-interest groups seen in the CJ system (ex: juveniles, elderly, veterans, homeless, etc.) Communication with PWMI.  De-escalation tactics.  Suicide prevention and crisis treatment. Federal, state, county, local, and community-based resources.  Legal updates and liability.  Scenarios and hands-on exercises. </ol> I think the most inhibiting factor is going to be the time allotted for the training.  We could have a class that just barely scratches the surface at 8-hours long, or an in-depth examination at 80-hours long.  It all depends on what the participants can allow.  That being said, I believe all 14 of the suggestions above are essential for training mental health and criminal justice actors to benefit PWMI.  This training would cover nearly every aspect of how PWMI intersect with the CJ system.  It would allow both MH professionals and CJ personnel to understand the others' jobs, the clients' needs, and the system's limitations. "
780,"Hi Serenity,  Thank you for your post.  I liked that you honed the training down to assessment, stigma, responding to and de-escalating crises, and PWMIs' rights.  That group is succinct and absolutely necessary.  However, I am going to challenge you a little bit.  You said in your opening statement that the training needs to be ""in-depth and all-encompassing.""  I am not sure that if we just address the four topics above then we will have an  in-depth and all-encompassing understanding of PWMI in the CJ system.   For example, we may want to understand the roles and responsibilities of all the players.  We may also want to take a look at available resources or the co-occurrence of substance abuse and mental illness.  What else do you think might be valuable to really bring understanding and knowledge to the people receiving the training?  Thanks, Steve"
781,"Hi Elise,  Thank you for your post.  I enjoyed reading your plan for mental health literacy.  I agree, having a deeper understanding of PWMI would certainly bring about more compassion and support for PWMI.  I want to know a little more about what you mean by mental health literacy.  You mentioned tips and tricks for recognition and symptoms, but that was about it.  Can you tell me more about what this literacy is?  What does it cover?  Who puts it together and how is it presented?   Also, don't you think it's important for the other side of the equation, the mental health professionals, to know more about the criminal justice side?  Shouldn't they understand the roles and responsibilities of all the penal system players?   Thanks, Steve"
782,"There are several reasons to focus on non-violent offenders:  1. Non-violent offenses and property crimes are more common in jails.  They are for sentences less than a year and for housing inmates pending trial.   2. Non-violent offenders are more likely to be receptive to diversion efforts, having a brief exchange with the CJ system, as opposed to violent offenders who may be sentenced to prison for many years. 3. Non-violent offenders are the fastest to be returned to the community.   For violent offenders, they have already shown a propensity to hurt others.  Their treatment and recovery need to take place in an environment in which they are no longer able to victimize the public.  As such, violent offenders need to be treated while in prison.  Diversion is not an option for them. "
783,"I think there are some similar and some dissimilar hurdles for the CJ and MH systems in implementing evidence-based practices.  Similarly, they both have bureaucracies and hierarchies in which change is not rapid.  It takes time to implement new systems.  In addition, they both have relatively poor communication practices and means by which to disseminate information.   Dissimilarly, the CJ system and MH systems do not work in the same spheres.  They overlap, but they are wholly separate entities.  In the CJ system, there is little research on best practices.  There are so many different aspects to the CJ system that MH is only one small portion of it.  Conversely, in the MH system, it is comprehensively about mental health.  Therefore, finding, understanding, and implementing the best practices in mental health are more likely to be successful.  "
784,"This seems like an excellent approach.  By treating both aspects of co-occurring disorders, treatment providers are able to address deleterious consequences simultaneously.  If providers really only addressed mental health, but ignored substance abuse, or vice-versa, they are taking one step forward with one step back.  However, if we treat both simultaneously, we are allowing an opportunity for two steps forward.  If this were ti be integrated into the CJ system, we would be able to prevent recurrence and recidivism.  "
785,"I think the most valuable part of peer mentoring is the ability for both parties to see they are not alone.  Stigma tends to come from the unknown.  When both the mentor and the mentee know they are not alone in their battle, the stigma begins to diminish.  This was briefly mentioned in the video when one of the mentors discussed that it was good for her to know there are other people out there struggling with what she struggles with.  I would imagine that this is a very existential idea until you actually meet someone with similar struggles.  When you sit across a table from them and commiserate or talk about your successes and failures, you break down barriers and wipe away the stigma.   On another note, people looking at this from the outside get to see that both the mentor and the mentee, having both suffered from mental illness, are normal people.  They are just like you and me - they just have something going on in their lives that gives them a challenge.  I appreciate the fact that the participants are open enough to put this out on the Internet and show that there is nothing to be afraid of.  The stigma can be wiped away and we can realize the normalcy of mental illness.  "
786,"The American College of Physicians (ACP) conducted a review of the available literature regarding integrating behavioral health into primary care. From this research, the ACP made six recommendations summarized as:  (1) Integrate behavioral health into primary care  (2) Remove payment barriers  (3) Fill health care coverage gaps  (4) Research effective approaches  (5) Provide training and education  (6) Reduce stigma Behavioral health is intertwined with physical health. When the mind is not functioning correctly, the body soon follows. As cited in the paper, “many common physical symptoms seen in the medical setting have no identifiable organic cause.” In other words, some of the deleterious consequences of mental illness result in physical symptoms that can only be beaten by conquering the underlying causes, such as mental illness, related behaviors, substance abuse, and nutrition. When you look at this list, it is a comprehensive recommendation to integrate behavioral healthcare in the primary care setting. The authors defined behavioral health as mental health disorders, substance abuse, stress conditions, and lifestyle issues (such as eating disorders, social isolation, and sedentary lifestyle). They cited the need as the increased likelihood of physical illness, increased mortality rates, poorer treatment outcomes, and higher health care costs. There will be a short-term increase in costs as the expense of screening, counseling, and services are funded. Yet, the long-term expenditures will decrease over time as the physical benefits are realized. The primary care setting, when spending time with a physician, provides the first and most-effective opportunity for screening and addressing both physical and behavioral health care. Treatments of the most immediate and acute symptoms may lead to secondary and tertiary treatments for underlying causes. Referrals with direct access to mental health professionals provide guidance and support services without delay. A patient-centered all-encompassing approach is supported throughout the literature. We cannot treat symptom A without examining and treating symptoms B, C, and D. We would be foolhardy in doing so because we do not know how the symptoms interact and whether"
787,"Hi Elise,  I always enjoy reading your posts.  I like your thorough approach to these questions.  One thing you mentioned got me thinking.  You talked about having children experience mental health screening beginning at young age and how that would reduce stigma.  I totally agree!  I think you bring up a good point.  Embarrassment is a learned experience.  A child who grows up in a community where nudity is not stigmatized is not embarrassed without clothes.  The same can be said for mental illness.  Removing the veil of secrecy and shame will serve to normalize what is so often perceived as abnormal.  I wonder, though, what do you think it will look like 5, 10, or 20 years in the future?  Will we really be able to have an all-encompassing medical system or will our fast-paced, time is money, quantity over quality patterning continue into the future?   Thanks,  Steve"
788,"Hi Viviana,  Great post!  You clearly articulated the need for mental health services within both the primary care and penal systems.  I completely agree with the necessity based on the prevalence of mental illness and its secondary consequences.  However, something you said gave me pause.  You intimated in both references that cross-training physicians to provide services within their respective areas was necessary.  I wonder if that is the most appropriate use of time and talent.  As you know, general practitioners are very good at general diagnoses and family medicine.  However, when it comes to specific ailments, not immediately evident, they turn to experts in their fields, such as thoracic, cardiac, or orthopedic doctors.  We do so because when you specialize in something, you are the best person to treat it (theoretically).  If we translate that to the mind, we would need psychiatric and psychological experts to treat mental illness, not generalists.  Perhaps the best use of time and money would be to train for recognition and necessity, but leave the actual treatment to those who specialize in that area.   Just a thought, but what do you think? -Steve"
789,"To prevent Souders' death, psychiatric staff should have been consulted (the prison psychiatrist was on extended leave). Souders also should have been transferred to a mental hospital (or regular hospital) to stabilize him, and give him fluids and meds. "
790,"I also want to mention something my coworker told me, whose boyfriend is a police officer in the mental department of a prison in Los Angeles. She said her boyfriend's unit puts new officers in that division first, almost to ""break them in"", even though they don't have any desire to work with the mentally ill. I am aware this is a anecdote without statistics, but it sounds exactly in line with Souders' experience, where officers in the institution did not know how to treat mentally ill inmates. If security officers are going to be stationed in mental health facilities, they must have some prior training or education in mental health, so as to approach inmates from a more clinical and less punitive perspective. Officers who simply wanted to restrain Souders may have had good intentions, but they were grossly uneducated as to what he needed and that ultimately lead to his gruesome death. "
791,"Thank you for bringing up malingering, that's an important weakness in both the mental health system, as well as the criminal justice system. Staff in this video fatally assumed that their inmates were feigning illness to lessen their sentence, even though some were gouging their eyes out or stabbing themselves multiple times in the stomach.  Volunteering in a prison, and working in a mental health clinic, I have seen staff fall into this countless times. We assume clients and inmates are lying to us, or manipulating us, and are told to not believe them, even when their complaints are very credible and understandable. This can be dangerous and even fatal when inmates are complaining of safety and wellbeing hazards.  As our book also pointed out this week, the way mentally ill persons are treated in our criminal justice and healthcare system has fluctuated with regards to how much liberty and dignity individuals are afforded. While malingering individuals certainly do exist, the over-assumption of individuals as manipulative and untrustworthy hearkens back to how patients used to be treated as ""undesirables"" and locked up against their will on a mass scale. "
792,"Non-medical reasons are arguably the  main determinant of mental illness treatment throughout history. From as far back as pre-civilization, where the clan and family well-being were the driving factors, to our current political system where political agendas and the parties in power determine mental health funding by the federal government, it has been the unfortunate trend that PWMIs are mostly left in the hands of the contemporary cultural attitudes, rather than current medical science. For a large portion of history, multiple cultures saw mental illness as a result of spiritual or mystical causes. Jewish folklore, for example, believed that  dybbuk were evil spirits that attached themselves to people and gave them mental illnesses. Cures for mental ailments were therefore often to blame the individual (i.e. call them a witch and burn them at the stake) or to try to cure them by removing the unclean spirits though means such as exorcisms (Slate, 2013).  Hopefully now society has begun to be more responsible with how they view mental illness, especially seeing as psychology is now focused so heavily on scientific methodology and empiricism. It's hard to predict what will drive future mental health policy, but science has progressed such that we at least know substantially more about mental illness and what can cause/cure it. "
793,"I came to a similar conclusion, and hope that our current knowledge on the causes of mental illness can keep us from inflicting the same (or any) level of torture inflicted on patients throughout history. Unfortunately, after watching the 60 minutes video, it's still clear that we subject PWMI's with a lingering degree of brutality that even crosses the line into torture. We may not drill through their skull to release demons, but we still deprive them of water and chain them to their beds until they die of dehydration. "
794,"After reading this week's article on gun violence and mental illness and listening to the lectures, its resoundingly clear that a registry for the mentally ill would do far more harm than good. 3-5% of the violence reported in America was attributed to mental illness, and the majority of mentally ill with guns (around 60%) actually end up hurting themselves rather than others. According to this week's lectures, around 1 in 4 individuals will have a diagnosable mental illness within the span of a year (lecture 1-1). With this in mind, it is frightening to think of the consequence of listing roughly a quarter of the U.S. population on a registry, with the goal of stripping civil liberties or even showing up at their door and searching their home without their consent. This would not only incite fear of the government, it would incite fear of having a mental illness at all, and therefore would keep citizens from seeking help that could completely cure them of their illness. "
795,"    I think every single need is important that was mentioned by the TED speaker. However, when I was looking at her list of fundamental needs, I was reminded of maslow's hierarchy of needs. This is an old theory in psychology that suggests that people have an ascending order of needs, and they must meet their basest needs (food, water, shelter, etc) before ascending to higher needs (friendship, connections, need for individuality, etc.). This is how I approached the question, not according to how much PWMI need each item, but the order in which those needs much be fulfilled. Based on this approach, I believe that the most pressing needs were safe secure housing and gainful employment. The interesting thing about meeting these needs, also, is that it simultaneously gives PWMI the opportunity to have autonomy in their own lives (i.e. having a job and making their own money), and also secures their need for connection (i.e. coworkers, neighbors, customers/clients).  My conclusion, then, is that the need for public affordable housing, perhaps with an on-site case manager that can connect PWMI to employment, must be funded more broadly be the federal and state governments in order to fix the current problem caused by deinstitutionalization.   Needs listed in the TED video: Safe secure housing Structure and meaningful activities Gainful employment Interpersonal relationships Social connectedness Autonomy and agency empowering and humane relationships with service providers  "
796,"When civilizations in history viewed PWMI as ""undesirables"", society would consequently treat them as beneath animals, with no self-determination, locking them up and torturing them behind secure walls and away from the public eye.  The view I found most interesting, though it was not extensively described, was the ""Ancient Civilization"" period, where Greek and Roman government began to pervade, while also maintaining emphasis on community and family. Because family and the community unit was still so important, the modern philosophers like Plato and Hippocrates viewed PWMI as they would any other sick person. They prescribed humane antidotes and cures that still prioritized humane and comfortable treatment, and even hired ""curators"" to guard the afflicted person's properties and honor their lucid wishes. From this period I gather that cultures that draw PWMI into community and family are more likely to view them as full-fledged members of society, and are therefore likely to give them more autonomy and self-determination.  Even now, the discussion around a mental health registry is telling to the mentality that still pervades our society. If we are willing to put an entire population of individuals (about a quarter of the entire population, according to our lectures) on government surveillance and scapegoat them for violence in society, it is clear that we still see PWMI as ""other"", and not full-fledged members of society. "
797,"I agree with you. I had initially heard in previous psych classes that attitudes towards mental illness throughout history have swung like a pendulum but after the lectures and reading, it looks like history has broadly alienated and demonized the mentally ill. This is with the exception of perhaps ancient civilization, where Greek and Roman philosophers took a more compassionate, dignified, and community-oriented stance on treating the mentally ill. But you are correct, especially right after the ancient civilization period, the middle ages and renaissance were horrific in how they treated and tortured the mentally ill, and even in the age of enlightenment and pre-civil war PWMI were treated as ""undesirables"".   In fact, the age in which we're living now seems like one of the better times with regard to how we treat mental illness. Psychology and therapy is a growing field, and seeing a therapist is not as taboo as it once was. The #metoo movement is a good illustration of this: it is no longer shameful to disclose our trauma publically, and there was a national suicide awareness month that just passed. It's not a perfect society, obviously, but it does seem that society has grown in its understanding of mental illness, what it is, and what it is not. "
798,"I like that quote, and it seemed to be proven true when reading chapters one and two. Societies that prioritizes family and community made the mentally ill their responsibility ended up treating PWMI far more humanely. Once society began to make institutions to house PWMI, it became easier for the general public to forget about the, demonize them and alienate them. The ""not in my back yard"" is a good example of this. By the time this movement sprang up, PWMI had been separated behind high walls and closed doors for decades, and the public was not used to seeing them, so when they were reintegrated, society was afraid of having PWMI in their neighborhoods, fearing them as ""crazy"" or ""undesirable"". It's only by exposure that we normalize the mentally ill. Once depression, suicide and anxiety became acceptably shared over social media and in the public square, Americans realized that they had a neighbor, sibling, parent or friend that was affected, and whom they loved anyways. The TED speaker from this week accurately identified that it is partially through having community and connections that PWMI are able to become helpful and whole members of society and society, in turn, can embrace them as active members."
799,"Hearing President Obama speak on mental illness drew such a stark contrast with President Trump, in both implication and terminology. Speaking of homelessness, Trump says: ""We have people living in our … best highways, our best streets, our best entrances to buildings ... where people in those buildings pay tremendous taxes, where they went to those locations because of the prestige[...]” (Orskes). This statement implies that civil structures designed to enrich the lives of Americans are being invaded and dirties by those that are not like us. He even uses the term ""our"" when referring to highways, streets and buildings, which hearkens to Link and Phelam's phase of stigmatization called ""Separating 'Us' from 'Them'"". While terminology itself may not change anything, it can certainly effect change. Obama refers to PWMI as ""fellow Americans"", suggesting that they are citizens of this country, of the same rights and privileges as those without a mental illness. I believe it is powerful to call PWMI because it means that we are now responsible for them in social and welfare policy, because that is what America does for its citizens. With regards to policy, I think it was smart for Obama to lump Mental Illness in with any other physical illness, and therefore to make it part of our healthcare system, which normalizes mental illness in a way that breaks down stigma. Oreskes, B., Rust, S., Shalby, C., & Cosgrove, J. (2019, September 17). Trump says California cities 'destroying themselves' with homelessness.

800,"In politics, a good way to measure how important an issue is to a government or politician is how they spend their money. If a government cuts benefits to mental health care, it simultaneously communicates that the government does not care about mental health, and that it does not consider mental illness a true ""illness"" because government has kicked it out of the sphere of healthcare resources."
801,"I was actually unsure what they meant by psychiatric drugs, because I do think there is some place for antidepressants or anxiety medications. I do agree with the soldier, Chris, who put a heavy emphasis on finding support groups and therapy to talk about his experience, instead of just medicating it away. I wonder if it would be a good idea to give veterans a stipend to visit any therapist they want, because I do know it is hard to find mental health services that work for you that are also in network. They could alternately provide pro bono or tax write-offs for therapists willing to see veterans for very cheap, or for free. I do, though, think there should be an availability of both psychiatric medication and therapeutic services, but they have to be balanced, because it is unhelpful and disrespectful to try to simply medicate away what veterans have experienced."
802,"I'm not sure society should step in and mandate treatment, with the exception of those who are a threat to themselves and those around them. Maybe I lean this way because I would rather allow PWMI to keep their liberties and autonomy as long as possible, unless it is clear that they are about to hurt themselves or someone else. It seems to rob PWMI of their personhood to force them to get care, especially hospitalization and similar extreme remedies, simply because they have a mental illness. Maybe their mental illness is less severe, or they are not violent, in which case it seems like an overreach of government to force them into a hospital or inpatient facility, where they surrender many of their liberties. "
803,"My curricula would vary by age group for elementary, versus middle and high school kids.    For elementary school kids I would focus on debunking the stigma of violence, discussing how common mental illness is, and showing interviews with people with mental illnesses when they are lucid explaining their specific illness (like the army veteran with PTSD that we watched this week). I would emphasize these things specifically because, like the video with President Obama mentioned, it is important to put a face to and normalize mental illness. Showing individual experience and discussing how many people go through this may make children less afraid, or make them think it is not so ""weird"", and therefore it should help to break down the ""separating us from them"" stage of stigma mentioned in  Link and Phelan (2001). If we can break down to children the differences and show how they are just people suffering from a sickness, that could help to hijack the steps to stigma referenced by Link and Phelan.  For high schoolers, I think it may be important to discuss more complicated issues like the co-occurrence of substance abuse. I also want to note that, since certain disorders like antisocial personality disorder are not diagnosed until adulthood, it may be useful to start talking about what to look for when diagnosing certain common mental illnesses, since mid and older high school aged kids are going to start experiencing a mental change around this time. Perhaps showing interviews with fellow-teenagers that have depression, anxiety, etc. would be helpful so that high schoolers who are beginning to show signs of mental illness will not feel so weird and alone. I would also offer resources for teenagers beginning to experience substance abuse, and emphasize that if they are feeling alone in their experience, they have resources available to them so that they can find help and support."
804,"I loved the way you started this post, it was a very good point. I would only say that instead of biology, I would probably start talking about this in a class like health, especially because several mental illnesses begin showing themselves once children reach adolescence or adulthood. We teach kids about sex and periods, but not about the changing brain chemistry that can go with adolescence. I'm not saying, obviously, that mental illness is the same as these, but rather that mental illness can begin to be obvious around the same time, as children approach adulthood. I think it is fair to let kids know that it is fairly normal to experience a lot of mental changes around this time and that they aren't alone in that is really important. "
805,"I really loved that point, and had not really thought of that before. I think, even beyond John nash, it may be helpful to devote a section of curriculum to examine the works of those famous influencers who have experienced mental illness (maybe during mental health awareness month). I immediately thought of Vincent Van Gogh and his work, but also Abraham Lincoln (depression) and Beethoven (bipolar) are excellent examples of PWMI who have had a transformative influence on our culture. It may be really helpful to just expose kids and have conversations around incredible and influential people who happened to have a mental illness. This, as you said, breaks down the stigma of stupidity around those with mental illness, and even gives children people to look up to that lived with a mental illness. "
806,"Hey Cornise, You made a great point that I did not think of: elementary children with mental illnesses. When I think of mental illness, I tend to think of it starting around high school when brain chemistry begins to change and certain personality disorders become apparent. However, I still remember there were children in my elementary school that, looking back, probably had some sort of mental illness. I remember I knew something was different about them, but no one had ever discussed the idea of mental illness with me, so I responded in ignorance and kept my distance because, honestly, those differences scared me. It would have made all the difference if my teachers would have brought up what it looked like to have a mental illness, and how we can still be kind and recognize their humanity."
807,"False positives would represent people who had to be civilly committed who were not actually mentally ill. If we were unable to test the validity of this decision, for all we knew, this would mean society has a lower likelihood of having someone that was a potential threat on the street. I do not believe this, especially since a very small portion of PWMI are violent, but I could see how society would want more false positives, so as to keep potential dangers off the street. In reality, false positives pose a low threat to society but a high threat to individuals with mental illness, and their liberties. False negatives pose a higher actual threat to society, as it is what happens when someone with a mental illness goes undiagnosed. Now as I mentioned, a very small portion of PWMI are violent, but when violent mentally ill persons go undiagnosed, tragedies like the one that lead to Kendra's Law happen (an untreated PWMI pushed a woman in front of a subway).  False negatives pose a low threat to the liberties of PWMI, but a high risk for society, as well as PWMI's health (they will not get treated).  Based on these consideration, it would be most wise to use mental evaluations that have a high sensitivity, rather than prioritizing specificity. The problem with this conclusion is that it potentially compromises the individual liberties of persons with mental illness. If we broaden sensitivity, so that more people are civilly committed, it also increases the likelihood that innocent persons will have their liberties stripped from them  as they are committed against their will. I, personally, believe that the solution should prioritize individual liberties, and so we should increase specificity, while also making policy to protect society in other ways from violent PWMI. Policies like gun control, for example, may be one way to decrease some forms of violence while preserving freedoms for the PWMI community."

809,"Just based on description, inpatient is more of an over-reach. Also based on my experience working in both inpatient and outpatient psychiatric programs, inpatient programs that I have seen require clients to live on-site, and may even have nightly check-ins while clients sleep to make sure they aren't hurting themselves. This mimics the prison structure a little more than outpatient, though neither are really comparable to prison (inpatient homes will often be normal houses, as opposed to prison facilities).  Outpatient programs, even intensive outpatient programs, allow clients to return home after the day is over, and so their liberties are partially preserved. "

811,"Comparing our readings from this week, our textbook seemed to most directly answer the question. When asking how to measure success for inpatient versus outpatient, it is helpful to look to the purposes of both.  Inpatient is helpful for those individuals that require the highest level of care, and so may represent a threat to themselves and society if they are given more freedom. The textbook cited the events at Virginia Tech as a good reason to recommend a patient to inpatient commitment.  Cho was evaluated and considered a potential danger, but was recommended for community outpatient commitment, and so he fell through the cracks of the system (Slate,  Buffington-Vollum & Johnson, 2013). The criteria for inpatient commitment are as follows: mental illness, dangerousness to self/others, grave disability, least restrictive alternative, and need for/incompetency to consent to treatment (Slate,  Buffington-Vollum & Johnson, 2013). All of these paint a picture of an individual that, if left alone, would either be unable to care for themselves, or may hurt themselves or someone else. In this sense, inpatient can be said to succeed if it holds individuals in an environment that can stabilize and care for them so that they or someone else are not hurt. The cons of this type of commitment is mostly having to do with how many civil liberties are stripped, how it deters individuals from wanting further treatment, and how coercive it is. Considering these, it is important to note that inpatient is most successful when it is used in extremely limited measure, and for those who are in dire need of 24/7 intervention. Outpatient, conversely, is mostly to safely introduce individuals back into the community after hospitalization, to prevent deterioration to the extent to where they would need hospitalization, or to provide support to individuals instead of hospitalization (Slate,  Buffington-Vollum & Johnson, 2013). Therefore, outpatient can be deemed effective if an individual either stabilizes or improves from the level that would be considered appropriate for hospitalization. Some added indications of success mentioned in the reading was compliance with medication and an added readiness to seek or continue treatment (Slate,  Buffington-Vollum & Johnson, 2013).    Slate, R. N., Buffington-Vollum, J. K., & Johnson, W. W. (2013).  The criminalization of mental illness crisis and opportunity for the justice system<"
812,"I had forgotten one of the criteria that you mentioned in your post for inpatient, and I think it is particularly important to remember: inpatient partially exists to relieve the burden of care to the PWMI's family or society. While involuntary commitment is extremely dangerous to civil liberties, it can conversely be helpful when properly applied to individuals that are simply too difficult to look after for an average family. If an individual needs round-the-clock care, it can be too difficult for members of a household to stay home to care for their loved ones. I was thinking of one of the readings from this week, saying that African-American communities were disproportionately affected by involuntary commitment, and it was unclear if this statistic was based on bias and discrimination, or lack of access to the least-restrictive alternative for some populations. If looking at this from a socioeconomic perspective, it may make sense that lower socioeconomic groups may need involuntary commitment in a higher proportion, simply because they cannot afford to stay home or extend extra resources to care for the individual. This could be all speculation, but I did appreciate you bringing up how inpatient can be helpful for families that cannot bear the weight of treating their mentally ill family member.   Swanson, J., Swartz, M., Dorn, R. A. V., Monahan, J., Mcguire, T. G., Steadman, H. J., & Robbins, P. C. (2009). Racial Disparities In Involuntary Outpatient Commitment: Are They Real?  Health Affairs,  28(3), 816–826. doi: 10.1377/hlthaff.28.3.816"
813,"I was considering some of those indicators of success as well, especially if a statistically significant portion of individuals are able to return to society without relapse, compared to those who do not seek treatment. One of this week's texts observes that, though commitment certainly has its downsides, to not seek treatment has even more grave effects on PWMI's, namely relapse symptoms, homelessness, arrests, victimization, suicide and episodes of violence (Slate,  Buffington-Vollum & Johnson, 2013). It is at least scientifically accurate to say that, if such outcomes show significant decrease after being commited (inpatient or outpatient), that we may consider that intervention a success.   Slate, R. N., Buffington-Vollum, J. K., & Johnson, W. W. (2013).  The criminalization of mental illness crisis and opportunity for the justice system. Durham, NC: Carolina Academic Press."
814,"Either Prosecution and Pretrial Services or Adjudication seem to present the most difficulty to PWMI. Several components in these steps seem particularly difficult for those who may not have a firm grasp of reality. PWMI may not know, nor understand their rights before a judge. If they don't understand their right to legal assistance, for example, they could be left to defend their case alone, with limited legal knowledge. The accused may also not be able to work with their lawyer to present their case, which could make it harder for their lawyer to get the whole story conveyed to the court. Finally PWMI may have a hard time before a grand jury because they may not present in a way that is favorable to their case. If the accused is having hallucinations or delusions, for example, they may come across more unhinged to a jury of their peers because they may not know the extent of their illness, nor how to argue that their illness had an affect on their actions to a grand jury. They may simply say, ""God made me do it"", which may come across to the average person like the accused is simply a psychopath that could do this again. The accused may not know how to say ""I've had intrusive delusions telling me to hurt people, and it's ruined my life, and I don't know what to do"", which could better convey that the defendant was motivated by mental illness and needs help more than prison."
815,"Though prop 57 has not yet gone into effect, I could see this having a very positive affect on PWMI, since it puts incentive on them to go through programs to be released earlier. I am unsure how many jails have mental health programs available to them, but I do know that being involved in certain types of programs may help with mental health outcomes. If PWMI are incentivized to work through a program, they may be able to achieve therapeutic and life-skill outcomes. I do understand that prison programs may be limited, though, and I do not know much about what is offered, but in theory this could be a really great idea.  What could negatively affect PWMI, like the latter video stated, jails will have such a lack of resources that they will be unable to provide services to the mentally ill in prison, even medical services when needed. If jails become overburdened, and we do not allocate more resources to them, it may cause the same problem at a lower level, as PWMI continue to waste away without help in the criminal justice system, just at a county level."
816,"I understand why police would be the first responders for PWMI, especially because PWMI may be found disproportionately on the streets, where police are the sole enforcers. I do not think it is ideal for PWMI to be under police jurisdiction, however, and believe that there may be a benefit to allocating sources to the psychiatric emergency team (PET team). Working in mental health clinics for the last few years, there have been times where a client is extremely elevated, and now poses a danger to themselves, even beyond what our facility can provide help for. In these situations we call the ""PET team"", or the psychiatric emergency team, to come and take them to a psychiatric hospital to be put on hold. They are practiced in dealing with the mentally ill, and act as a psychological ambulance of sorts. Ideally, it would be most wise to allocate resources and people to teams like this and circulate an emergency number (similar to 911) for people to call if they see someone on the street that may be in crisis due to mental illness."
817,"After watching the Fox 9 video and hearing the officers' take-aways from the training, it seems that CIT training can help teach police that it can be just as effective (or even more so) to talk to someone and show empathy as it can be to come in ""guns blazing"". Several officers, according to the video, came in skeptical to the training, but were so glad they did it later. After hearing these perspectives, it seems that CIT breaks stigma by teaching that PWMI are human beings going through something difficult most times, and need empathy and compassion. We learned this in the first few modules, how society that felt more responsible for their mentally ill tended to treat them less like animals, and with more compassion. It seems that, considering the culmination of our class videos, empathy is most powerful in breaking stigma related to mental health."
818,"According to Taheri, CIT is useful for breaking stigma around PWMI and reducing the likelihood of PWMI being arrested, referring them instead to community-baed programs. However, Taheri's meta-analysis overall shows that CIT training produces no significant effect on officer use of force, or on arrest rate. Considering the direction of outcomes is somewhat promising, and the author points out that research is still lacking, perhaps one solution is to enhance and refine CIT programs and research outcomes more, though that does involve a lot of time, volunteers and money. If the study revealed that officers that were CIT-trained were more likely to refer to community based programs, though arrest rate overall was null, perhaps the programs need to be implemented more widely, since not all programs contribute enough academy time to CIT training. If not enough police are educated on PWMI and de-escalation, it makes since that there would not be many radical outcomes, since police may be influenced by other department or city's mentality around the use of force and skepticism around de-escalation. I am reminded of the Fox 9 video in one of our modules that told of officers that were skeptics when starting training, but believed that it made them better at their job in the end. If there is general skepticism around CIT in the police force, I believe it may take some time and broad education across multiple counties and states for the training to have deep and long-lasting effects. I am not so discouraged by Taheri's findings, since there is some indication that it is moving us in the right direction, though it may not show enough significant results now. Most importantly, as the author noted, there should be more research of CIT effects on police brutality before we make a conclusion as to its effectiveness."
819,"Hi Wendy, this was also my main take-away from the reading. I also noticed one anecdote in the reading corroborated this finding: an officer that was repeatedly called to a house for an 8-year-old that was having outbursts at his mom. Once the officer was CID-trained, he was able to identify that the child may be displaying instances of mania, rather than just bad behavior, and was able to refer the mother to NAMI resources (Slate, 2013). Instances like this are what the Taheri article is suggesting - namely - that CID training may not produce significant results in arrest rate and use of force, but it increases likelihood that officers will refer citizens to community resources (Taheri, 2016). I believe this, while not statistically significant according to this study, is still just as important.      Slate, R. N., Buffington-Vollum, J. K., & Johnson, W. W. (2013).  The criminalization of mental illness crisis and opportunity for the justice system. Durham, NC: Carolina Academic Press. Taheri, S. A. (2016). Do Crisis Intervention Teams Reduce Arrests and Improve Officer Safety? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Criminal Justice Policy Review, 27(1), 76–96. https://doi.org/10.1177/0887403414556289"
820,"I agree with you, after reading the findings of the Taheri article. It seemed a bit soon to conclude from the article that CIDs were a blindly adopted novelty, especially since it has some positive outcomes, like reducing stigma and increasing connection to community resources (Taheri, 2016). Taheri also conceded that there could be improvements in the research and methodology of the research, which I believe is telling. If a program has not been implemented to a wide enough research pool, and there are not enough studies yet with regard to reducing violence and arrests, I think it is too soon to rule out a program that has the potential for so much good.  The Slate reading also gave examples of police and mental health integration services, which have produced remarkably low arrest rates, such as Houston's Crisis Intervention Response Team (CIRT), which allows clinicians to ride along with police officers, which yielded an arrest rate of 1% after 14,000 calls (Slate, 2013). I believe that, if we were to test the effectiveness of mental health awareness and crisis intervention programs more extensively, we may find more promising results.    Slate, R. N., Buffington-Vollum, J. K., & Johnson, W. W. (2013).  The criminalization of mental illness crisis and opportunity for the justice system. Durham, NC: Carolina Academic Press. Taheri, S. A. (2016). Do Crisis Intervention Teams Reduce Arrests and Improve Officer Safety? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Criminal Justice Policy Review, 27(1), 76–96. "
821,"I honestly can't begin to comprehend what someone must feel who has been jailed more than 100 times relating to mental illness. I would feel hopeless, like I was never going to get help, and like I was only destined to be punished if I try to seek after my basic needs (shelter or food). I would feel desperate because I had no money or place to stay, and would probably need to steal or trespass to find food and shelter."
822,"As mentioned in the second video, I think returns to prison and mortality rates, when compared to other inmates, are important for mentally ill inmates. If they are dying at higher rates or returning to prison at higher rates, that is an indication that facilities are not providing adequate care and that interventions are not working towards lasting outcomes. One additional indicator may be how many PWMI have access to resources when they are released, since one video mentioned that many PWMI are released with medication but no plan to build a meaningful life for themselves."
823,"I understand all the rights inmates are currently given and believe them to be, overall, appropriate. I do believe that some of the rights could be carried out better. While the right to healthcare is included in inmate rights, I do not think that this right extends far enough to properly cover the mental health of inmates. One of this week's videos points out that, while PWMI may leave jail with psychotic prescriptions, they are unprepared in every other way. I think that it is America's duty to provide more holistic mental health treatment to individuals, and to connect them with appropriate mental care and resources after they leave jail. For example, inmates could be connected to treatment and addiction programs while in prison, so that they may stay at a halfway house, or something similar, after release. It seems that, while jail affords basic medication under their healthcare rights, they let individuals slip through the cracks in every other way. "
824,"Coming from an undergraduate psychology program, I was told several times how psychology was considered a pseudoscience, and so now it leans heavily on quantifiable data so as to be ""taken seriously"". My first assumption regarding why medication is so important to treatment is that it is a ""measurable science"", a medical normality, and achieves quantifiable physical results. Psychotherapy deals with changing the mind and cognitive processes, and so it is difficult to quantify its results and success immediately. Since federal and state budgets are usually stringent and government wants to make sure they are not wasting money, it makes sense that their treatment would fall back on more tangible physical and medical remedies."
825,"The use of prisons/jails for PWMI is largely inappropriate, mainly because it actually seems to prevent individuals with a mental illness from getting the actual treatment that they need.  The text this week mentions that incarceration in PWMI statistically decreases the likelihood that those inmates ever received mental health treatment. Specifically, they are less likely to have used outpatient services, and more likely to have visited an emergency room and/or inpatient psychiatric hospitalization (Slate, Buffington-Vollum & Johnson, 2013). This is additionally significant when considering that outpatient treatment contributes to a lower recidivism rate (Slate et. al, 2013). Perhaps this all means that the criminal justice system could do a far better job at notifying PWMI of the resources they could pursue when out of jail/prison. This is difficult since it would require prisons to be able to work closely with psychiatric or social programs, which would require an operational shift in state and local prisons to share responsibility with community programs. PWMI is additionally unhelpful because it can increase recidivism rates in inmates with mental illness. As discussed in the lectures, prisoners have the right to medical care while in prison, but this only really means having access to psychotic medication in the case of PWMI. Unfortunately, medication alone may not be enough to really cause a long-term impact or reduce recidivism rates. Not only did one lecture point out that discharge planning is the  least frequently provided mental health service by the criminal justice system (lecture 5.4), but Slate et. al pointed out during our week around psychiatric outpatient treatment that it is outpatient care that yields the best long term results for recidivism rates.  Finally, an increase of PWMI in the criminal justice system can strain resources and keep PWMI from getting access to the hospital beds they may need. This is especially because, as one article notes, beds are so scarce that those court ordered to a psychiatric hospital bed take priority and take up a large portion of the beds (Torrey, Kennard, Eslinger, Lamb & Pavle, 2010). This may lead to PWMI remaining deeply ill while incarcerated, and with little hope of transfer. <span s"
826,"I did not mention this in my post, but I really liked that you included that the mentally ill population is also impacting the productivity of the criminal justice system, which is being weighed down by individuals that it has little licence to handle or treat. The class video showing a jail in Orange County was a great example of this. Having to shut down an entire section of the facility because they could not afford to staff it is not only detrimental to the inmates (who have to share a smaller space and limited resources), but also to the community which may have genuine need to house actual criminals, while mentally ill inmates occupy that space with little to show for it - no mental health treatment, and higher recidivism."
827,"You pointed out that realignment was supposed to decrease the amount of those returning to jail for minor offenses, and I do think this could be positive, if done correctly. We learned during the realignment week that those that would usually be sent back to jail would just go through a probation officer instead in some cases. I think this could be a positive thing for PWMI because being connected to a probation officer could allow access to someone who could refer them to a treatment program or support group. "
828,"After watching the second video, regarding the usual function of probation officers, I think it is fair to at least consult risk assessment tools. Probation officers work alongside their clients and observe their overall progress, while connecting them to resources (housing, jobs, etc). While risk assessment tools may not be helpful as the only indicator of potential risk, probation officers may factor it into their final report to give to the courts when considering their client's future. "
829,"Mental health professionals, over all, would probably not be as receptive to the RNR approach because it prioritizes recidivism over mental health treatment emphasis (Skeem, Steadman & Manchak, 2015). I would only say this could vary among mental health professionals that deal more with evidenced-based and data focused therapeutic styles like CBT and DBT models. This is because behavioral models measure success through decreased recidivism and decreased maladaptive behavior, which is also the overall measure used by the RNR approach.  I work at a clinic that teaches CBT and DBT and the RNR emphasis reminds me a little of the way we measure success in our clients. With more psychodynamic methods, though, since the emphasis is less on quantifiable data and more on individual treatment experience, I can imagine they would feel that the RNR approach undervalues the importance of the treatment of mental illness. Because mental health professionals may put more emphasis on qualitative, rather than quantitative, outcomes,  they may consider self-report factors like life satisfaction, quality of relationships, and self-concept. Quantitatively they may be concerned with a decrease in symptoms related to their mental illness, such as spells of depression or symptoms of mania.   Skeem, J. L., Steadman, H. J., & Manchak, S. M. (2015). Applicability of the Risk-Need-Responsivity Model to Persons With Mental Illness Involved in the Criminal Justice System.  Psychiatric Services,  66(9), 916–922. doi: 10.1176/appi.ps.201400448"
830,"Depending on how severely mentally ill the person is, the probation officer may not be set up well enough to handle those special needs. If the individual was mentally ill in a way that may be easily medicated or treated through therapy, however, I do think that specialty caseloads and the type of supervision that focuses on treatment could be set up to handle PWMI appropriately. Because specialty caseloads are designed to allow probation officers with more training to work more closely with their client, and walk them step by step through the restoration process, I believe this type of rehabilitation model is the most helpful I've seen for PWMI who have commited a crime. This model allows PWMI to have their own ""guide"" that can help them access benefits, find jobs and housing, and secure treatment, rather than just locking them up.  Because, as we've already covered in class, jails have such a large number of PWMI, however, I am concerned that probation departments would be overworked, underfunded and understaffed to meet the needs of the mentally ill that currently reside in prison."
831,"Can treatment and reduction of recidivism go hand in hand with a new prioritization of policy focussed on recidivism, known as the RNR model? Examining RNR through a genuine concern for treatment-centered restoration, there certainly may be a need to worry. Skeem notes in her work that the popularization of the RNR approach has led to a ""deemphasis of mainstream evidence-based mental health practices"" (Skeem, Steadman & Manchak, 2015). And this makes sense. If our criminal justice system is worried more about keeping inmates from returning to prison, they may choose to take shortcuts around actual psychological treatments. My advice to  Chief Probation Officers regarding supervision of PWMI is to use social science to implement policies that give more individual attention to  PWMI while in probation. Giving more specific attention to this population during the probationary period can actually allow opportunity for individuals to be connected with treatment. This can help to strike a balance between mental health practices and recidivism reduction. Though data on persons with mental illness  interacting with the RNR model is scarce, there is a way to target recidivism in PWMI while also allowing space for treatment. Training specialty probation officers for mentally ill population appears to coincide with the aims of RNR, namely, to reduce recidivism in PWMI in the criminal justice system. But employing specialty probation officers serves a dual purpose: to give PWMI populations the special and individualized care they need to both treat their illness, as well as reduce recidivism. Skeem et al. (2017) found that PWMI that were assigned regular probation officers were 2.68 times more likely to be rearrested than PWMI who were assigned specialty officers.  Furthermore, specialty officers are given more extensive training and walk more closely alongside their clients to ensure they are gaining access to treatment as well as social benefits (housing, employment, etc.) according to lecture 6-3 from this week. Skeem stresses the link between psychiatric care as ""the key to reduction in recidivism"" (Skeem, Manchak & Montoya, 2017). In this way, RNR may not be suitable in itself, but specialty caseloads may be the bridge to connect PWMI with the RNR model in a way that still guarantees them specialized attention and care.    Skeem, J. L., Manchak, S., & Montoya, L. (2017). Comparing Public Safety Outcomes for Traditional Proba"
832,"I also mentioned that specialty caseload would be the best solution to implement regarding PWMI in the probation system. We have learned so far that probation is the more practical way to reduce mass incarceration, and restore felons to be active members of society. Rather than throw PWMI in prison, where they stay longer than the average inmate, and planning for release is not often provided, probation is one way to follow up and slowly help PWMI return to the community. In one of our 6-3 lecture videos, the San Diego probation chief also mentioned the cost effectiveness of probation, cutting annual cost for PWMI from around $50,000 $1,500. If this solution helps provide treatment to PWMI (using the specialized caseload model) while being more cost-effective, it is indisputable that this is the wisest option. "
833,"I like that you included pointing out that data suggests that mental illness has, statistically, very little to do with crime (Peterson, Skeem, Kennealy, Bray & Zvonkovic, 2014). This made me rethink that, maybe, the worries regarding the RNR model could be overblown, since treatment of mental illness does not necessarily mean the person's antisocial behavior will be reduced. For this reason, I think it is important for the probation officer in charge of PWMI to be holistic in their approach to restoring the individual to society. They must work to connect them to treatment resources, but must also give them other resources common to any offender, like connection to community, job and housing.    Peterson, J. K., Skeem, J., Kennealy, P., Bray, B., & Zvonkovic, A. (2014). How often and how consistently do symptoms directly precede criminal behavior among offenders with mental illness? Law and Human Behavior, 38(5), 439–449. doi: 10.1037/lhb0000075"
834,"I think the retribution emphasis still circulated in many prisons could aggravate conditions of mental illness. In some of the documentaries in the second video, we see solitary confinement, forcive strip-and-punishment methods and beatings being administered to inmates. I imagine conditions like paranoia or schizophrenic disorder and imagine what it might do to be randomly stripped by faceless correctional officers, or to be locked alone with your racing thoughts for extended periods of time. In cook county, I was encouraged to see programs implemented like a psychological transition program, to take a more instructive and gentle approach to prepare inmates for their release and life after prison. These programs also seem to help inmates find an appropriate balance of medication, which some in the documentary said was already life-changing. I think these methods are most promising for the alleviation of mental symptoms and hope more prisons make the switch from retributional to rehabilitative. "
835,"I certainly think it's possible, but it takes more resources than the federal and state government currently fund. We do not allocate enough to community treatment programs, and there is not enough supervision to ensure follow through with taking psychiatric medications. If, hypothetically, PWMI worked very closely for an extended period of time with a parole officer to connect to support groups, housing, employment, and medical/psychiatric resources, than I do believe it is possible to rehabilitate them. "
836,"That's a great point! I think some assume that, because individuals may experience a lifelong battle with mental illness, that they cannot be rehabilitated. In reality,  rehabilitation aims to reintroduce individuals into society to contribute in a meaningful way. Perhaps an inmate will always experience, and need to medicate, symptoms of depression, but they can still find a meaningful job, provide for a family, and forever cease criminal activity. This, to me, is true rehabilitation. "
837,"I'm skeptical that solitary confinement is advantageous at all, any more than other correctional measures that could easily be substituted. It seems to me that being denied access to communal activities would do just as much to a person by way of punishment (taking away social interaction) without introducing something so extreme that could create new symptoms of PTSD and hostility. Even in the anecdote in the second video, inmate Brett Collins recalls that he wasn't a violent person, he was pretty peaceful, but the intensity of solitary confinement lead him to lash out at guards in ways he would not have otherwise. I understand the desire to use solitary, especially with particularly troublesome inmates, but I believe that prison systems are integrating themselves with the psychological field to find new and more effective ways to rehabilitate bad behavior, rather than just punish, and I do not see any rehabilitative value in solitary confinement."
838,"I would be glad to spend my taxes on adequate mental health resources for the mentally ill, and even non-mentally ill in prison. In my view, this is an investment in a safer society, as well as a society that is unburdened by over incarceration, and a society with less deleterious effects on youth that would otherwise struggle with family incarceration. If anything, I think more funds should be allocated to mental health and behavioral treatment programs in prison, such as CBT programs, since such programs actually have positive outcomes on reducing violent behavior, and only 2.5-6% of the prison budget is currently going to mental health at the current time. The way I see it, and perhaps I'm biased because I work in the clinical field, allocating funds to mental health is an investment that gives back over time, unlike more punitive measures like solitary confinement, where our taxes are spent to ""teach inmates a lesson"", but produce more negative symptoms in the long run."
839,"You made a good point, I think there are other funding options to treat mentally ill inmates. I do think we over-cut mental hospitals several decades ago, and so it would be beneficial to fund both more mental hospitals, as well as more community-based treatment and supervision after release. I am not opposed to funding mental health programs while in prison, but you reminded me that there are other helpful programs that can help with release-planning and giving life skills after release. "
840,"Balancing what must be taught to criminal justice and mental health actors is difficult because they lie on opposite sides of the spectrum.  Mental health actors often lean towards treatment, while criminal justice actors lean towards control. It is difficult to find solutions that walk a middle path of protecting from and controlling criminal behavior while also effectively treating individuals.  Mental health actors in the criminal justice system have been criticized for not being as accurate as actuarial prediction models (Adams and Ferrandino, 2008), and so they could improve and be trained in correctional methods that are evidence and outcome based, such as cognitive behavioral therapy and CIT training, which also has the added benefit of being more crisis-based and less traditionally therapeutic. This would also be helpful since the treatment of choice in prison is often medication, since it is a faster and easier ""fix"" to deviant behavior. While there is evidence that more complicated therapeutic solutions can improve PWMI behavior, there is a lack of actual therapeutic intervention. Since discharge planning has proven helpful and affective, it may be helpful to teach therapeutic staff how to goal set and take a case management approach with clients (Adams, 2008). As for the criminal justice staff, they may most benefit from training regarding unacceptable methods of discipline, and how to de escalate violence and agitation, to create a more tranquil environment. After reading Adams and Ferrandino (2008), my main takeaway was how important it is to take a pro-social posture in the incarceration and discipline of persons with mental illness. Current disciplinary models approve of extremely punitive measures like strip isolation, which is actually suggested to worsen behavior and outcomes over time (Adams, 2008).  Conversely, if an environment is non-hostile, pro-social and communal (i.e. the milieu setting or therapeutic community), and if an environment reduces frustration and insult ( which triggers aggression), there seems to be a positive behavioral response by inmates (Adams, 2008). With these outcomes in mind, it would be helpful to meet together with both mental health and correctional staff to discuss these models and goals for the prison environment. Perhaps CIT and CBT training could help teach helpful de escalation strategies for guards so that they do not resort to frustration or humiliation of mentally ill inmates, and"
841,"I'm unsure if it is reasonable to contain costs while also making the best decision for PWMI and prison staff in prison facilities. However, over time, the cost of more effective treatment may be outweighed by the cut cost of PWMI as they are released sooner with more effective treatment.  After examining both articles from this week's reading, I would create two additional sections of jails and prison dedicated to substance abuse programs and exit planning/counseling and another section dedicated to the Therapeutic Community (TC) model for mentally ill and addicted inmates, which reduces need for more severe and adversarial punishment methods (Adams & Ferrandino, 2008).  The benefit with TC models is the creation of prosocial skills, which directly contrasts more punitive models that include isolation and solitary confinement, which can increase aggression and suicidality. This model is also used commonly in substance abuse treatment, and has resulted in positive behavioral outcomes (Adams & Ferrandino, 2008). There may be some sticker shock for implementing these programs at first, however current data shows that failing to treat PWMI (especially those with substance abuse disorders), substantially increases the likelihood they will be incarcerated again.  As we discussed in previous weeks, the cost of housing an inmate for one year is around $50,000 (Lecture video 6-3 San Diego Probation Chief interview). Additionally, creating a separate department in prisons to focus on exit planning could additionally help reduce cost. Prisons could hire probation staff to work with inmates in a case management capacity and connect them to resources, which has been proven to increase likelihood of reduced recidivism overall (Slate, Buffington-Vollum & Johnson, 2013). Additionally, this department could connect inmates to probation officers once they are released, which is cheaper than prison and more effective. Overall, I do believe that more resources should be allocated to inmates with mental illnesses, especially because of their increased rates of reoffending and increased likelihood of their behavior warranting infractions, since most outbursts attributed to mental illness are met with punishment rather than treatment (Lecture 7-3).  If more resources were allocated to treat PWMI, they may require less supervision and discipline overall, because they may commit less overall infractions. Additionally, such a large pe"

843,"Hey Suzanna, Great point! I believe ""investment"" is the best way to approach funding mental programs. Such a large population of inmates suffer from mental illness that it only makes sense for prisons to allocate resources to better meet the needs of this portion of their population and reduce recidivism (Baillargeon, Knight, Harzke, Baillargeon & Becker, 2009).  Disrupting the cycle of incarceration, release, lack of resources, and reincarceration will save PWMI from spending years untreated and not contributing and will also save taxpayer money overall by funding the endless incarceration of the mentally ill without any treatment or resources to get them out of the cycle.  Baillargeon, J., Penn, J. V., Knight, K., Harzke, A. J., Baillargeon, G., & Becker, E. A. (2009). Risk of Reincarceration Among Prisoners with Co-occurring Severe Mental Illness and Substance Use Disorders.  Administration and Policy in Mental Health and Mental Health Services Research,  37(4), 367–374. doi: 10.1007/s10488-009-0252-9"
844,"I think separating PWMI is a smart idea, that eventually does save money. While additional space must be funded and allocated, the approach of creating Therapeutic Communities (TC) reduces the likelihood of inmates committing more infractions, since aggression tends to mount when PWMI are exposed to frustration or insult, which is a common occurrence in the usual prison setting (Adams & Ferrandino, 2008).  Separating PWMI may also reduce instances of inmate violence and rape, since mentally ill inmates often make surrounding inmates uncomfortable and angry, which could lead to lashing out Adams & Ferrandino, 2008). The cost of diverting all of these negative outcomes could help provide incentive for separating PWMI and creating TC models within the prison system.    Adams, K., Ferrandino, J. (2008). Managing mentally ill inmates in prisons.  Criminal Justice and Behavior, 35(8), 913-927."
845,"I think I, given my education and the program I am in now, would understand the need for such a facility and be excited about the investment. I wonder, however, if the average citizen in Missouri would understand the science and history behind why modern psychiatric hospitals are so desperately needed. Speaking for myself, I would love more funding to be funneled to projects like this, especially in highly populated states like california and New York, where homeless communities flock to urban areas."
846,"The second video especially spoke to this question. Because judges do not want to sign off on the release of a mentally deranged killer, the NGRI is usually a life sentence. As we also discussed in previous video lessons, mental hospitals still may have a prison-like aesthetic or effect, so being locked away for life is still not a pleasant or easier experience. "
847,"I understand the concerns of the commissioner for the dept. of mental health in that ""we run hospitals, not prisons"", however I think she made this too black-and-white of an issue. The hospital can still hire security staff trained in restraints, in case a patient is having a violent outburst. It's unfair for the facility to accept violent clients while only employing therapeutic and treatment-oriented staff, and they may be able to make up for their understaffing by hiring safety/security officers throughout the facility."
848,"Deep brain stimulation is incredibly exciting and seems to carry a lot of potential. I would only be cautious about refining it before widely circulating it, since 2/3 of patients feel a difference and Edie was the most dramatic of their success stories. That suggests that 1/3 have potentially harmful electricity being pulsed into their brain, and I'm not sure what the consequences of that would be. I of course think this cure is worth pursuing and seems to be doing a lot of good for some of the patients utilizing it. "
849,"As discussed in the readings, the initial deinstitutionalization acknowledged that there would be a small sector of the emancipated state hospital population that actually really needed to be there, and would not be accepted anywhere else. Forensic populations (i.e. incompetence to stand trial, not guilty by reason of insanity and sex offenders), and difficult-to-discharge patients remain in need of a more intensive option, and are not suitable or desirable for the community treatment option overall (Fisher, Geller & Pandiani, 2009). Additionally, state hospitals can add specialized courses for these individuals, pertaining to jail based competency programs, and also have safer enhanced treatment programs for particularly violent clients that could pose a potential threat for staff in community treatment programs (State of California, 2018). For this reason, I do think there is a place for state hospitals, and think it would be wise to crease more hospitals, as well as more life-skills classes within the existing state hospitals.  But beyond this,  state hospitals can work alongside the criminal justice system by adding security staffing to their forensic and violent clientele within the state hospital. This can reduce instances of violence directed towards therapeutic staff that are not hired to act as enforcers, as seen in this week's video (Lecture 8-3, video 2). Additionally, state hospitals can add conditional release programs and perhaps work with probation officers to provide forensic inmates with a guide as they transition back into the community (State of California, 2018).  The State Hospital model is therefore perfect to interact with the criminal justice system to ""catch"" mentally deviant individuals that would otherwise fall through the cracks and burden the prison system by violence, recidivism, or the inability to improve without very individualized care. As discussed in previous weeks, the prison system has an overrepresented mentally ill population that recidivates at a higher rate, leading to a growing criticism of prisons as the new psych wards. These populations need more care, but when they are met with overly punitive retributions (i.e. solitary confinement and the like), they may get worse, and so the typical prison model is inappropriate for these individuals (Slate, Buffington-Vollum & Johnson, 2013). If the two systems worked together, prisons could reduce the burden high-demand individuals and more effe"
850,"I'm wondering, though, if the population of incarcerated individuals didn't also increase in state hospitals because of the increased proportion of mentally ill that have contact with the criminal justice system? In this situation, correlation may not equal causation. I am mostly trying to say that trying to separate the criminal mentally ill population from the non-criminal may be exceedingly difficult, since there is now so much overlap in the population, and that does not necessarily mean that the mentally ill coming out of the criminal justice system are inherently violent in nature. It could be that, even if they were convicted of a violent crime, the right medication and psychiatric treatment could stabilize them a great deal, so as to eliminate the threat of violence.  Regarding especially violent individuals, (recurring violence, not just those who committed a violent offenses) the California Department of State Hospitals did mention that they have begun construction on specialized Enhanced Treatment Programs, which designate specialized facilities to this population, and sound a lot like what you are talking about (State of California, 2018).    State of California (2018). The California Department of State Hospitals 2018 Annual Report. Retrieved from https://www.dsh.ca.gov/Publications/Reports_and_Data/docs/2018_Annual_Report.pdf."
851,"Hi Nani, I would only add that I think there is a huge need for state hospitals to also intervene with ""difficult to discharge"" patients, rather than just IST or NGRI patients, simply because these individuals may eventually end up incarcerated if they are released into the community without resources. These individuals may have ""inappropriate"" general or sexual behaviors, both of which can present a risk to themselves or others, and may make them too risky or difficult for community treatment options (Fisher, Geller, & Pandiani, 2009). I think ""difficult to discharge"", IST or NGRI patients all present an imminent risk of ending up in the criminal justice system, or else being stuck without the appropriate treatment in the criminal justice system, which may lead to an endless cycle or recidivism and re-incarceration.   Fisher, W. H., Geller, J. L., & Pandiani, J. A. (2009). The Changing Role Of The State Psychiatric Hospital.  Health Affairs,  28(3), 676–684. doi: 10.1377/hlthaff.28.3.676"
852,"I think further examination and research could be done as to what to ethically share in alignment with client confidentiality. As Jim Parsons mentioned, disclosing things like substance abuse may tamper with a inmates legal case and de-incentivize their honesty when talking with a mental health professional. I also would like to know what part the APA  plays in this discussion. If information could be declassified from clinical records, it would likely have to be a decision made from the APA itself. I would be curious if they would be willing to work with experts that bridge the gap, such as Parsons, to understand what circumstances validate the sharing of information for the client's wellbeing."
853,"The first obvious difference in the CIT approach is how the officers entered the situation.  They did not look as though they came in assuming a threat, they even greeted the individual as a peer, ""How you doing today, man?"" This can immediately help to set the agitated person at ease, since the officers are not approaching with hostility. They did not lean into authoritative commands, but asked open ended questions like ""tell me about the medication you have there"". They also did not immediately presume or insinuate wrongdoing, but took an empathetic approach, telling the man that it seemed as though he had a lot going on in his life. None of this is necessarily enforcement, but is therapeutic and empathetic in nature and, when employed by a police officer, can be an even more powerful procedure for those already overwhelmed and in crisis."
854,"Perhaps those leading correctional facilities do not have see treatment of PWMI as a job description or priority. It is costly and difficult to implement all the recommended changes, and those in charge of prisons may not see that as their job, but rather focus on detaining and punitive measures to keep their prison in line.  Only when courts step in and provide legal ramifications do prison administrators understand the gravity of their mistreatment of PWMI."
855,"I currently work in a mental health clinic, and my first thought upon watching the video was that it may be difficult to help prison inmates understand why they need mental health services. Even in a non-forensic treatment center, it is still incredibly difficult to work with clients who do not see the need for change, the value of treatment or have the desire for change in their lives. Inmates have the potential to be even more difficult, since they are essentially forced to be there, and so it may be difficult to make them see why treatment would be beneficial, and therefore it may be difficult to teach them therapeutic and behavioral skills.  It would be valuable to provide cross-training specifically so that mental health staff are able to understand what may accompany the experience of incarceration. Violence, rape and trauma from solitary confinement may be especially prevalent to this population, and so it may be beneficial to know this to compile treatment plans. Additionally, training mental health staff on what resources they can recommend may be the most important aspect of training because it can provide for continued mental health support once prisoners leave the facility."
856,"Certainly connecting mental health and criminal justice staff with resources to recommend upon imprisonment and release is a necessary and vital aspect of training for mental health providers. This is mostly important to build continuity  so individuals with mental illness do not get lost between steps in the process of court, incarceration, reintegration and continued treatment. Mental health staff, for example, may benefit from knowing the medical staff facilities, correctional release planning procedures, and behavioral health resources available in prison (Lecture 9-4). If a mental health worker has an incarcerated client, or works within the prison system, being able to connect their client to these resources in the prison can help set the client up for continued treatment while in prison, and after being released into the community. They may be able to refer the client to prison behavioral or work/school programs, or be able to begin setting up post-release plans for housing or community support. For criminal justice staff, it is helpful to receive basic mental health training which introduces staff to specific diagnoses, disorders and symptoms they may commonly encounter in PWMI. As we covered in previous weeks' lectures, PWMI often receive more severe disciplinary action,  since their noncompliance or deviant behavior is not seen as a symptom of an illness, but rather a willful act of disobedience. Helping criminal justice staff to understand signs of mental illness can also help them decrease use of force and battery, since such knowledge may help them approach situations in a less aggressive and more empathetic manner (Parker, 2009). Of course bringing criminal justice staff up to date with psychological resources can also help individuals either reintegrate after being involved in the system, or help them never get involved in the first place. For example, in lecture follow-up video 9-2, one CIT officer notes that more than half of calls involving CIT resources end up not being arrested. If officers are informed of the mental health resources available to them, they may be ready to refer PWMI with the more appropriate help, and even help refer them before they make contact with the criminal justice system.      Parker, G. (2009). Impact of a Mental Health Training Course for Correctional Officers on a Special Housing Unit.  Psychiatric Services,  60(5). doi: 10.1176/appi.ps.60.5.640"
857,"Your first point made me think: I think a big part of criminal justice and mental health worker education is informing both parties about all the responsibilities of the other. Working in tandem with each other and understanding the symptoms of the client as well as the strength of the other field (i.e. criminal justice or mental health field). The course reading ""Developing a Mental Health Court Learning Objective"" notes that relevant curriculum includes training regarding the role of criminal justice actors in the court process (probation/parole and stakeholders in the court system). But beyond this, you made an excellent point that the curriculum must be more wide than it is deep. With perhaps limited resources available for pioneer training programs, and so many topics relevant to teaching criminal justice personnel and mental health staff about the field of the other, breadth and scope must be prioritized over depth if we had to choose between the two. I believe that giving an overview on all relevant diagnoses is similarly as important as a knowledge of psychiatric medications, and certainly as important as de-escalation tactics and suicide prevention. Programs are fairly compacted, with some being only about ten hours, and it is hard to learn thoroughly about everything, but I think all the points you listed do make up a good ""crash-course"" for all a criminal justice worker would need to know to be more skillful in encountering PWMI (Parker, 2009).   Parker, G. F. (2009). Impact of a mental health training course for correctional officers on a special housing unit.  Psychiatric Services,  60(5), 640-645."
858,"Amber, I really liked how you tied in the higher arrest rate for PWMI. In fact, the statistic you mentioned about PWMI being twice as likely to be arrested is an interesting complement to the general statistic that only about half of calls to police that involve CIT staff ends in arrest. It would seem that providing CIT trained staff on police calls could help to ""even the playing field"" and keep arrest rates around more normative levels (lecture 9-2 follow up video)."
859,"I wonder if they focus on non-violent offenders mostly because of public image. I understand there are other legal complications that arise when PWMI commit acts of violence, and that those actions must be prosecuted, but I did not see anything in that video that would not also be a good resource to violent offenders with a mental illness. I do think that leaning into treatment for violent offenders may be publicly controversial, especially since we are not many years removed from our ""tough-on-crime"" approach. Many may see treatment as an attempt to excuse violent behavior."
860,"Coming out of a clinical background, it seems that the field of psychology has already begun to make the shift to evidence-based prioritization and practice. Where we once focused on talk-therapy, most psychological majors lean heavily into data, statistics and empirical methods. We still have a long way to go in transition to completely evidence-based, and there may be an argument for whether to keep more traditional talk therapy (not evidence based). The criminal justice system, on the other hand, may have to undergo some serious reforms to implement data collection techniques to social and criminal justice agencies and services in order to transition to evidence based practices. Additionally, after leaning heavily into a tough on crime ideology for years, there may be more obstacles in distributing information regarding treatment alternatives, especially to more punitive forms of law enforcement."
861,"It seems as though one of the main issues this co-occuring model addresses is the complication of multiple funding streams when two agencies come together. When agencies combine, not only can they cover more individuals, but they can simplify a complicated system. Social benefits and government funding can be difficult to navigate, especially if you have a mental illness and/or are homeless without the practical resources to seek out the relevant agencies to meet the needs of your disorder. "
862,"We discussed many weeks back some ideas for how we can break mental health stigma, and a big part of it was just knowing someone in your life that had a mental illness. Programs like this mentorship program could go a long way in making their most difficult symptoms a point of connection to their mentor, and can feel less alone or ""weird"" in their illness. For those doing the mentoring, they may break some of the stigma around their illness as well. The clinic I work at specializes in dialectical behavioral therapy, and one of the skills we teach is that helping other and contributing to society can take you out of your own misery and give you a sense of meaning that can counter your negative existing feelings. Perhaps through mentorship, mentors can begin to see their story as a tool to help others, and be empowered by their story of mental illness, rather than feel ashamed of it."
863,"Based on previous weeks, we already know that the primary method of treatment for PWMI in prison is medication. It is a cheaper, quicker, ""band-aid"" fix that, which extremely important and helpful in its own right, does not go far enough in producing behavioral change that can deter future recidivism. The full primary and behavioral integrated healthcare outlined in the reading is defined as a team of behavioral and mental health clinicians that work together to achieve cost-effective care (Crowley & Kirschner, 2015).  If the fields of primary care merged with mental health care, this may very well change the way prisoners are treated and assessed in the criminal justice system, and presents the possibility of being cost-effective as it can keep offenders from a repeated cycle of recidivism into mental illness,  the streets, and then jail. One example of a skillfully integrated program includes Tennessee's Cherokee Health System, which employs mental health workers to give a psychiatric evaluation upon visitation (Crowley & Kirschner, 2015). If the criminal justice system currently can provide medication and medical staff at facilities, I wonder if the merging of both fields may lead to mental health staff trained in psychiatric evaluation, which may help inmates as they can be screened for underlying factors of behavioral problems. Merging the entities also implies that psychiatric evaluators can work with other treatment staff to provide inmates with more comprehensive care. The article mentioned that case workers were sometimes also employed in colocated care, which may allow inmates to begin the process towards more successful release planning (Crowley & Kirschner, 2015). Bringing mental health and primary care together has the potential to stop the cycle of incarceration and recidivism not just medication, but also case planning and behavioral health strategies, which do more to address reoffending and keep inmates off the streets in the future.   Crowley, R. A., & Kirschner, N. (2015).

864,"I always appreciate your perspective! I was thinking, as you mentioned how temporary costs go up while long term gains are expected overall, I also wonder how this shift could also decrease overall cost felt by the inmates. The article mentions that many times, patients with severe mental health issues are more likely to go to an emergency room or primary care physician (Crowley & Kirschner, 2015). Considering the high cost of emergency room visits and the relative ineffectiveness of seeing going to an ER long term as a PWMI (as opposed to a mental health professional), I wonder if this system will also lighten the burden of care for PWMI overall, which may assist somewhat with its comorbidity to homelessness. I speak from my own experience here, as well. When I was experiencing anxiety attacks, I did not know what was wrong, and made multiple trips to the emergency room. I owed a lot at the end of it all. However many times I went, though, nothing was physically wrong with me. It took several ER visits to have a doctor that I am so grateful for test me for anxiety disorder, after which I no longer had to make expensive trips to the ER. All this to say, I wonder if, while saving costs to the system in incarceration, collaboration of mental health and primary care could also keep PWMI from pointless emergency room visits, which could in tern increase their overall wellbeing and decrease likelihood of ending up on the street and later in the CJ system.      Crowley, R. A., & Kirschner, N. (2015).

865,"Your point hearkens back to one of the lecture videos from this week, where we discussed how new research and strategies are often not disseminated quick enough (if at all) to the relevant agencies that could use the evidence-based findings. When thinking along these lines, I believe integrating primary care with the mental health industry may accelerate the speed at which research makes it to the field. Doctors would be meeting with case managers and mental health workers, who may more quickly pass information between sectors, especially if one field has advanced past the other in some aspects. For example, perhaps evidence-based research has been distributed to social workers and case managers regarding effective group therapy methods that reduce behavioral symptoms. Doctors are therefore able to more effectively recommend programs to their patients for which medical cures are ineffective. Conversely, if there are breakthroughs in the field of medicine with regard to experimental procedures that can cure certain mental illnesses (like the small device inserted into a patient's brain that emits pulses to cure depression, as mentioned in one of our lecture videos), medical professionals can recommend those procedures to mental health professionals who are at a loss as to how to treat their client."
866,"Good afternoon,  I am Serenity Cripps. I was previously Serenity Horelly, but I got married over the summer and have yet to update my name in the school system. I enrolled in this program because I have always been fascinated with the topic of forensics, or what I thought forensic psychologists do based on television shows. While I realize that those shows do not accurately reflect reality, I am happy to say that I still find the topics we cover in this course highly interesting. I also came to apply for this particular program because I live in the middle of nowhere, and loved that I could attend a reputable school from the comfort of my home and without a commute.  I took a single forensic psychology course in my undergraduate degree. It was interesting, but looked mostly at specific court cases and the testimony/evidence that was presented.  I hope that through this class I learn how to better assist those that suffer with mental illness and find themselves in the criminal justice system, such that they do not suffer unjustified outcomes, and such that they receive the treatment they require. "
867,"Based on my understanding of the 60 minutes video, there were multiple actions that could have prevented Mr. Sounders from dying in prison. The first action would be a mental heath assessment by a mental health professional. This would require that the mental health staff employed by the prison be replaced while on a seven week leave of absence. If Mr. Sounders was assessed, it is my belief that he would be transferred to a facility better equipped to treat and monitor his mental health. The transfer could have kept him from being detained and restrained in solitary confinement, which would have saved his life. Another action that could have saved Mr. Sounders' life would be limiting the time that he was restrained. If Mr. Sounders had been allowed to move about the cell more freely during his detention, his mental state may have been different in regards to accepting water. Removing him from solitary confinement would have also been a simple way of achieving this. Based on how long Mr. Sounders was confined, the prison staff should have kept a closer eye on his water intake. Given that he was chained to the bed and the water to his room was shut off, the prison staff had to supply water. The average person can only survive 3 days without water before they die of dehydration. This time frame can vary based on the individual and the circumstances. Given how hot it was inside the solitary confinement cell, I would reason that it would take less than 3 days for Mr. Sounders to die from dehydration. Knowing this, the prison staff should have tried harder to get Mr. Sounders to drink water. Even if the prison staff did not want to force Mr. Sounders to drink water, they could have supplied him with IV fluids either in the medical center of the prison, or within his own cell given that he was chained to the bed and would not have been able to remove the needle or mess with the IV bag. It was the responsibility of the prison staff to make sure that his basic needs were met. To prevent his death, they needed to be more attentive. "
868,"Based on what I have learned in this week's lectures, along with a quick google search of what it costs to maintain a national registry, I do not think that a national registry of mentally ill persons outweighs the costs in regards to reducing gun violence. The most salient point to make is the fact that a very small percentage (4%) of gun violence is perpetrated by mentally ill persons. The cost to maintain a national registry that would only potentially reduce 4% of gun violence does not seem warranted. Additionally, there would be flaws in the registry that would allow for some persons who suffer mental illnesses but have not been officially diagnosed to go undetected and gain possession of a weapon regardless of the restrictions. It would be better to focus on limiting the ability of the media to link gun violence with mental illness, and to make sure that those who are truly a risk to themselves are protected from harm via guns.  "
869,"In the history of treatment and care of those persons ""with"" mental illnesses, the largest non-medical considerations tended to be social and political in nature. Men were far less likely than women to be institutionalized for social reasons, but did suffer this fate if they challenged social norms through their actions or presence. Women suffered largely for challenging the status quo, finding themselves institutionalized for questioning or disagreeing with their husbands or the Christian ideology, or behaving in any way that threatened their family name. Women could be committed for acting in any way that did not embody their domestic role, often times being committed as insane when there was nothing wrong with them. The society even created names for mental illnesses like ""politicomania"", criticizing political men, and ""erotomania"", prostitution, in order to force women to conform to the social narrative or suffer the consequences. "
870,"My initial instinct was to recommend that the solution to the problems PWMI have faced as a result of deinstitutionalization was to build and strengthen the community-based resources and treatment available. However, after watching the TedTalk, as well as learning out the effect of sensationalizing stories in the media, I believe that the most important problem to ""fix"" is the public perceptions and beliefs surrounding people with mental illnesses. The current public perceptions tend to be ones of fear, uncomfortable feelings, and a ""Not in my backyard"" approach. If we could shift the public perceptions to something resembling understanding, openness, or even an effort to understand, then I believe that the population of people with mental illness would find it easier to integrate into communities, regardless of the services and treatment options available. "
871,"Over the centuries there have be major shifts in the ways in which mental illness is viewed. The history of these views date back to the Stone Age, where tribal groups viewed mental illness as the product of evil spirits. Rather than take a collective interest in caring for those afflicted with evil spirits, it was the duty of the family to care for the mentally ill. If the family was unable to care for the mentally ill person, he/she was banished from the clan. The only mentioned form of treatment during this time was trephination, which involved removing part of the afflicted person's skull in order to free the evil spirit. Based on current knowledge of medical science, we can gleam that this was ineffective. During this time, PWMI were not considered full-fledged members of the clan/tribe, and their future was determined by their family, rather than themselves.  As society progressed into the time of Ancient Civilizations, the view towards mental illness shifted. No longer were people afflicted with evil spirits - instead they were suffering from ""malfunctioning physiology"" or ""imbalances in the body's fluids"".  These types of illnesses were thought to be easily treated by cleansing the body through surgery or with laxatives. The largest change in this time period was that PWMI were treated with humanity and kindness. This was a step in a positive direction toward considering PWMI members of society. Additionally, PWMI in this time were afforded more self-determination through the use of a curator, who made decisions on behalf of the person, based on what the person wanted as expressed in lucid states. This time period represented a step toward self-determination that is lacking in most of history.  The Middle Ages took many steps backwards in regards to PWMI. Religion became a ruling power and PWMI were thought to be possessed by demonic spirits. Torture and execution was massive during this time period, to include that set forth by the Malleus Maleficarum (The Hammar of Witches). This time period represents no self-determination and no inclusion in society as members.  The Renaissance moved away from the previous methods of torture and execution, but institutions for the detainment of the mentally ill emerged. This time periods also represents no integration in society and no self-determination.  During the Age of Enlightenment laws were proposed that were based on the idea that man is ration and acts by his own free"
872,"Sayla,  Thank you for your post.  You bring up an interesting point about celebrities. So far in this class the focus has been on the negative attention and criminalization that PWMI receive in the media after violent criminal acts occur. I believe that the assumption that any violent crime must have occurred by someone with a mental illness is society's way of rejecting the action as moral and socially acceptable, which would only be committed by someone who operates outside of societal norms (or as most people assume, PWMI). However, I have not noticed any specific talk about the ways in which media can be positive for PWMI. While we did watch a TedTalk that aimed at informing the public of the reality of PWMI, this is different that the power that a celebrity has. Celebrities are seen in our society as ""god-like"" figures - people that are praised for the goodness and adherence to societal norms. When one of these celebrities comes forward to share their own history with mental illness, it not only normalizes the illness itself, but it also shows society that PWMI are not necessarily ""crazy, violent"" people that run around shouting or shooting people. As more celebrities with varying mental illnesses come forward, this can begin to overshadow the largely negative media attention that PWMI receive. "
873,"Robert,  Thank you for your post.  I appreciate the comment you make about having your own misinformed preconceived notions about mental illness and people suffering from mental illnesses. I, too, am thankful for the knowledge this program gives and the ability to see beyond the societal misconceptions. Unfortunately, not everyone has the ability or the interest to take the classes like we do. I believe that it becomes our job as wielders of knowledge and decent human beings to share what we have learned here to others around us. It can be as simple as, when someone talks about an assumption of violence in PWMI, correcting them and giving them that 4% fact. Helping can also take the form of not turning away from a person that is clearly suffering with a mental illness. While safety should always be considered, lending a helping hand and making a PWMI feel like an integrated member of society can have a profound impact.  You are correct - there is much work to be done. I do hope that this class, the classes that came before us, and the classes that come after us can use the information we learn to help get it done! "
874,"A president can be effective in bringing about an end to stigma of mental illness by doing exactly what Obama did in this video - talking about it. By doing the exact opposite of what everyone wants to do (which is avoid talking about mental illness publicly) the president can call attention to the fact that it is perfectly OK to talk about mental illness. By highlighting the ways in which stigma is perpetuated, the president can force people to see their own biased beliefs and be forced to change them. The president can also host conferences that are aimed at mental health awareness. "
875,"The reduction of funding and benefits for mental health care makes a clear statement that those with mental health issues are not worthy of treatment, when compared with people suffering other illnesses. There are groups dedicated to raising month to ""find the treatment for cancer"", yet the same cannot be said for finding the ""treatment"" for various mental health issues. It is as if the policy makers are telling PWMI that they can suffer through on their own, because the federal and state money is more useful somewhere else. This tells clients that need this type of care that they are unworthy or lesser members of the community. "
876,"I would recommend that active military as well as veterans begin by gaining knowledge about troop specific mental illnesses like PTSD. There is a lot of stigma surrounding a diagnosis of PTSD, with some active or veteran members believing that admitting to having PTSD is a form of weakness or defeat. Educating the troops on how common and normal it is to have PTSD after doing what they did would make a difference in changing their perceptions and helping them open up. After individuals feel confident and comfortable that there is nothing wrong with being diagnosed with PTSD, group based discussions where soldiers can talk with other soldiers that are going through, or have experienced, the same things as them would be highly beneficial. As the soldier in the video stated, it helps just knowing that you are not alone.  I do not believe that forcing drugs onto the soldiers would be beneficial. I also know that there is a stigma around seeing a private therapist, and this too should be avoided initially until the members' ideas around it can be shifted. "
877,"I do not believe that society should be allowed to ""step in"" and mandate treatment except in the most extreme cases where the person truly is a danger to themselves or others. If someone is functioning and operating in society well enough, this should not be disrupted. It is important to not create greater stigma for PWMI by forcing treatment that they did not seek or want. The most important task would be helping the PWMI understand that there are treatment options available and guide them (without being forceful) to making a decision that would be the best for their health and welfare. "
878,"Based on my understanding of this week's readings, any educational program put in place to lower the stigma directed at PWMI should include face-to-face interaction with a person diagnosed with a mental illness. This is imperative because it is not until individuals see for themselves that PWMI are not ""weird"" or ""scary"" or ""violent"" that they will understand what is being told to them in the literature. The meet-and-greet type situation needs to be structured in such a way that it does not become a specticle or an opportunity to further stigmatize a PWMI. Educational teaching should occur prior to the meeting, such that the students understand conceptually that PWMI are nothing to be afraid of, followed by the face-to-face. Materials and literature should be all encompassing, at an age appropriate level,  and should not be limited to one perspective. For example, as highlighted in the Rusch et al. article, a strictly biological explanation of mental illness should not be utilized, as it can create a deeper ""us"" vs. ""them"" mentality. Educational programs should focus most importantly on the fact that mental illness is an illness, just like any other illness that a person may experience, and that PWMI are simply sick people that need care and treatment just like anyone else. Like Obama said in the video, just because we don't understand illnesses of the brain at the same level that we understand other bodily illnesses, does not mean that we should stigmatize or turn our backs on the people that need help and treatment.  To get a little more specific:  In elementary school, education should be simplistic. The children should be told that everyone can get sick, and everyone gets sick in different ways. Children should be encouraged to brainstorm different types of illnesses that they can think of, as an activity, and then the teacher should explain that mental illness is a sickness just like any of those, except that it affects the mind, which can make people act in different ways. Children should then be allowed to engage in activity with a PWMI, without being told that the person has a mental illness (this is to prevent any children from behaving inappropriately towards the PWMI). Afterwards, the children can be told and a discussion can happen in which any further stigma is brought up and cleared up.  As children progress through middle school and high school, education should become increasingly more complex, at an age appropria"
879,"McKenna,  Thank you for your response.  I noticed that we both focused heavily on the idea that education should come in the form of education and contact. Based on the readings, this appeared to be the most effective and beneficial combination of training. I too believe that this should start in elementary school. Since reading your post, I had a further thought about why this is important. As you point out, research finds that contact with PWMI as a form of education is more effective if the individuals already have knowledge or previous contact with a PWMI. BY starting in elementary school, this provides an opportunity to have repeat contact (again in middle school and high school), which increases the contact between students and PWMI, and also increases the likelihood of a decrease in stigma. Additionally, starting early before stigma becomes deeply ingrained in a child's mind is imperative. Waiting until high school, where beliefs are more highly fixed, would do little to change public perceptions about PWMI. "
880,"Robert,  Thank you for your response.  You make many good points. I too believe that the youth should be the target of any mental health programs. However, I do not think that we should give up on educating the adults of the nation either. While I do not believe that it would be effective to teach adults in the same way that you are suggesting we teach the youth, I do believe that stigma can be lessened among the adult population by making conversations about mental health more common place. It is important that our nation's leaders speak about mental health, to shed light on its normalcy and how there is nothing to fear from PWMI. Our nation's media also needs to shift how it talks about mental health. News sources should not be allowed to sensationalize stories that involve violent acts by PWMI. The mental illness should not be the focus of the story. Finally, movie starts, music artists, etc. that suffer from mental health issues need to become more vocal about their experiences. This will help to normalize mental illness in the minds of the nation because if they see that their favorite actor or singer suffers from a mental health issue but still acts or sings the way he/she does, then hopefully they can begin to see that there is nothing to fear. "
881,"The application of specificity and sensitivity would be most applicable to decisions about civil commitment in terms of the false positives and false negatives. Deciding which mistake is worse to make depends heavily on whether the decider is more concerned with protecting the individual or society. A false positive would pose a risk to the individual, while ""protecting"" society from harm that doesn't exist. In this scenario, a person that will not have a future issue with behavior related to their mental health is committed because they are falsely predicted to have a future issue. This is morally wrong in two ways: the individual is committed and contained indeterminately when he/she would have never had a future issue; and the premise of protecting society is abused because the individual ultimately would not have posed a future risk to society. However, many might argue that a false negative is the worst of the two mistakes that can be made. In this scenario, a person is predicted that he/she will not have future behavior issues related to his/her mental health and is not committed. However, in the future this person behaves in some way that is dangerous or unacceptable by societal standards. In this case, the ultimate wrong is on society because the mistake allowed for the release of an individual that the community needed future protection from. At this point, it is imperative that the community agree which needs more protecting, an individual's liberty and freedom, or the community's safety. "
882,"I think that involuntary commitment of sex offenders after they complete their sentence is potentially an OK idea in theory but most likely not a good idea in practice. Protecting society from individuals that are known to be unable to control sexually violent impulses, and would definitely continue to commit sexually violent acts, is something that should occur. What I mean by this is: if there is an offender, and it is known with next to no doubt that this individual will continue to commit sexual violent acts if released into the community, then this individual should be involuntarily committed. However, in practice, it is incredibly difficult to predict future behavior with any degree of certainty that would warrant involuntary commitment. What happens in practice is that some SVP will become involuntarily committed, deservedly, but others will be committed when they would not continue to offend in the community.  A potentially better system might mirror some sort of 3 strikes system. After serving their initial sentence, these individuals will be on conditional release, such that they have parole officers and are required to attend treatment multiple times a week. If the individual fails to attend treatment or maintain regular contact with the parole officer, they receive a strike. They could be given 3 strikes, such that after the 3rd strike they are committed after failing to adhere to rehabilitative and treatment efforts, under the premise that the offender does not wish to be treated and will most likely commit again in the future. An offender on conditional release that commits another sexually violent act will automatically be committed.  This system could be better because it allows those individuals that desire to have treatment and successfully reintegrate into society a chance to do so, while also protecting the community from those that fail to rehabilitate themselves or prove to be unable to control themselves and commit again. "
883,"I would think that inpatient commitment would be a larger reach of state authority into an individual's liberty. This is because in an inpatient setting, the person is completely removed from the community and their ability to go about their lives in the ways that they desire. In both instances there may be forced medication or required treatment, but in an outpatient setting the individual can still go about his/her life with a higher degree of regularity. "
884,"Looking at both inpatient and outpatient involuntary commitment, one can see many similarities in terms of purpose, pros, and cons. Both inpatient and outpatient involuntary commitment aim to treat those individuals who, due to a mental illness, are a danger to themselves or others, or are unable to meet their basic needs for survival. For those that truly need medication and treatment, but lack access to it, either type of commitment serves to help the individual stabilize and remain safe. Removing a potentially dangerous individual from the community (in the case of inpatient treatment), or helping a potentially dangerous individual deescalate (through outpatient services) also serves to protect the larger community in which the person lives. While both forms of treatment have the positive benefit of getting needed treatment and services to individuals in mental decline, there appear to be more benefits from outpatient treatment than involuntary inpatient treatment. Of those studied, outpatient treatment, especially over an extended period of time, is found to increase engagement in treatment and medication compliance, as well as increase the likelihood that a person will continue to go to treatment after the mandatory treatment has ended. Successful outpatient treatment is also associated with a decline in homelessness, declines in criminal victimization, and reductions in violence, both self-directed and in the community. However, in practice, involuntary outpatient services are rarely used, with a lack of funding directly impacting the success of these services. Inpatient and outpatient involuntary commitment share many other cons, including being anti-therapeutic, stigmatizing, and potentially discriminatory. Additionally, inpatient treatment services are often based on seriously flawed systems of predicting violence and are largely dependent on allocations of funds, with massive cuts seriously affecting the availability and effectiveness of services. Finally, both involuntary inpatient and outpatient commitments represent a interference and a person's liberty and freedom, raising constitutional concerns.  Measuring the success of either program proves to be of great difficulty. However, there are potential options. One potential option involves gathering an extensive background history of each person with suspected mental health issues. This history would include records of hospitalizations, treatment history, potential arrests, a"
885,"Caroline,  Thank you for your post. You take an interesting stance on the appropriate measure of success for these programs. While I can see the point you make about it not being beneficial for PWMI to feel prosecuted and stigmatized by going to a court hearing, I also see the court hearing as a way of allowing a PWMI a bit of due process before being committed against their will. If we take away the court hearing and allow PWMI to be committed based on the opinion of a single psychiatric official, I believe we will be doing an injustice to the rights of PWMI. Both inpatient and outpatient treatments, as highlighted in the text, are already challenged regularly as unconstitutional violations of a person's rights - taking away the hearing would mean that we provide fewer protections to PWMI than we do criminals of the law. I believe this would serve to further stigmatize PWMI, because it would be staying that they are less deserving of a chance to prevent indeterminate commitment than a criminal is. That being said, I do think we should devise the court hearing in such a way that it does not feel so persecutory - just because a PWMI is being assessed for need to be committed, does not mean that they should be made to feel like a prisoner or a criminal. "
886,"Sayla,  Thank you for your response.  You make some good points. Something I wanted to know more about is your suggestion of allowing PWMI that have been committed in inpatient facilities to choose the treatment that they want administered. While I agree that allowing this would serve to better the experience of the patient, I wonder if it would also prohibit proper and effective treatment. As we know from the text, for a person to be committed in an inpatient facility, they will most likely be in a mindset that will render them ineffective when it comes to making their own treatment decisions. This is especially true for those PWMI that do not recognize they have a mental illness. An advance directive, as discussed in the book, would be a good compromise in this situation. The advance directive lays out the medical decisions and treatments that a PWMI would want to receive in the event of a decline in mental stability and reasoning. The advance directive is drafted in a time of mental clarity, to be used in the event that a person needs medical treatment but is not able to coherently or effectively make treatment decisions. The advance directive still allows a person to make medical decisions, but based on logical decisions made during times of mental clarity, rather during times of mental instability. "
887,"I think the most difficult part of the criminal process for PWMI to navigate would either be the investigation/interview process or the plea and trial process. I think that the interview and investigation process would be difficult depending on the severity of the mental illness. A PWMI that is having issues with logical or coherent thought might be unable to defend or explain him/herself, making it harder to clear one's name. Additionally, the PWMI may incriminate him/herself without meaning to, due to the irregular thought process.  I think the plea and trial stages would be difficult for similar reasons. A PWMI may not be coherent or effective in assisting legal representation in mounting a successful case. A PWMI may not understand the consequences of different plea bargains, making it difficult to make informed choices. "
888,"If 47 leads to the amount of state savings it intends, this could benefit PWMI as the savings can be redirected toward mental health and substance abuse services. Funding for mental health services has been historically cut and directed toward the criminal justice system, so it would be beneficial to reverse this and send the funds the other way. However, shifting prison populations to state and local jurisdictions also causes issues for PWMI, as overcrowding of jails can lead to an environment that is not healthy or therapeutic for PWMI. Additionally, overcrowding can lead to lack of funding within the jail that might have been directed towards PWMI or other healthcare needs. "
889,"Given the lack of training that law enforcement officers have in regards to responding to and processing PWMI, I do not think it is fair that police serve as first responders to situations involving PWMI. It would be more appropriate to have someone that is highly trained in dealing with PWMI to serve as the first responder. If law enforcement personnel received more thorough training on responding to and processing PWMI, then it may become appropriate for them to continue to act as first responders. "
890,"A lack of training and understanding is likely to lead to an increase in stigma related to PWMI, as law enforcement is unlikely to understand why a person is behaving the way that they are, and how the situation can be de-escalated. CIT can help lower stigma related to PWMI by helping officers to understand that PWMI need to be treated differently than the average suspect or criminal. PWMI that come in contact with police are often in a time of crisis, which cannot be handled with force or be rationalized away. If police officers take this stance against PWMI, it is likely that stigma will be self-fulfilling as police officer behavior leads to dangerous or negative reactions by PWMI, which further affirms the officers beliefs. However, by training officers to effectively respond to PWMI in crisis, the officers can come to see that PWMI sometimes just need someone to talk to; that they are generally not dangerous to others, often only being dangerous to themselves, and they need help; they do not need to be shot. "
891,"While the Taheri findings indicate insufficient evidence that CIT reduces officer injury during encounters with PWMI, and indicates no effect on outcomes of arrest or use of force (Taheri, 2016), I would not push for a discontinuation of CIT models. Part of my stance on the continuation of CIT comes from the fact that, as Taheri indicates, the studies used for the meta-analysis had methodological limitations that limit the ability to draw any significant findings. Additionally, self-selection of officers into the CIT training program also limit the ability to determine if there is a true effect or if there is something inherently different about those officers that volunteer. However, this does not mean that the program does not work or should not continue to be experimented with. As the textbook indicates, CIT has been effective in reducing police use of force, lowering injuries suffered by both officers and PWMI, reducing arrests, increasing the use of mental health services, and reducing jail suicides. While these positive findings are not completely consistent across studies, the potential positive benefits warrant a continuance of usage.    The most important factor when deciding whether or not to continue the program stems from the benefits experienced by PWMI. If CIT initially does nothing other than lower the stigma police officers have toward PWMI, then it will be beneficial. As the stigma lowers, the manner in which officers approach PWMI will shift, and as this shift occurs, PWMI will be treated with greater respect and dignity. For example, in the lecture video ""A Softer Shade of Blue"", we were able to see an officer utilize CIT to converse with a PWMI in a manner that did not result in an arrest. Ultimately, the PWMI just wanted to pray with someone. Had the officer not been trained in CIT, he may of responded to the scene in a completely different manner, under the assumption that a drug using PWMI was unstable and ""likely violent"". The individual would have most likely been arrested, which would have ultimately done nothing to help the PWMI, and would have only increased stigma against him. By approaching the scene in a calm manner, it allows officers to minimize any negative reactions, as well as reduce the likelihood that arrest is needed in order to defuse the situation.  To summarize, I believe that CIT should continue to be implemented and that further studies should be conducted to better understand where CIT i"
892,"Georgie,  Thank you for your response. We are in agreement that CIT should continue to be utilized despite the Taheri findings. However, I have a question for you. The textbook discuses the importance of the integration of law enforcement with the local mental health services. One major aspect that contributes to the effectiveness of CIT is a 24/7 drop-off location for PWMI that has a no-refusal policy. Given what we have learned in regards to the budget cuts in mental health services, do you think that cities would be capable of maintaining enough 24/7 drop-off locations for use by CIT trained officers? If you do not believe that cities are currently capable of maintaining these mental health locations, do you think that CIT would continue to be as effective as it needs to be? "
893,"Tamara,  Thank you for your response. I thought this was an excellent response with a great deal of thought put into it. You make numerous great points that I too thought about in my post. One of the biggest factors I considered, and I actually didn't even consider it until I responded to Georgie, was the 24/7 drop-off centers. This seems to be of paramount importance to the effectiveness and ability for this program to actually work. Without having 24/7 drop-off locations, the police officers are limited in their ability to bring PWMI to places offering mental health services rather than to local jails. I too think that, with the tendency for mental health services to experience budget cuts, it would be difficult to ensure that no-rejection 24/7 centers will be available with enough beds to support law enforcement needs.  Stigma was the other major area that I focused on in my response. As the textbook notes, CIT is known to reduce police officer stigma toward PWMI. If the program offers nothing other than a reduction of stigma toward PWMI, it will still result in positive effects for PWMI in the long run. A reduction of stigma will lead to other positive results, whether or not that was the original intention. "
894,"I just want to start by saying that I find this video to be an issue in regards to stigma related to mental illness. To hear the interviewer say multiple times that most of the mass shootings are perpetrated by those suffering from untreated mental illness goes against what we have learned thus far in the course. This is the type of news media that contributes to public stigma and beliefs that PWMI are violent.  That being said, to comment on the multiple arrests and incarcerations, I believe that would be HIGHLY frustrating and stigmatizing for a PWMI. As the jail director said, most of these arrests are for inconsequential incidents like stealing food to have something to eat, or breaking into a property to have somewhere to sleep. These are not violent offenses, they are simply a representation of PWMI trying to survive on the street in communities where they are not being taken care of. With more access to shelters, mental health services, and treatment, these PWMI would not be arrested over and over again. This video highlights the ""churning"" of the criminal justice system in which officers are scooping up PWMI, incarcerating them, and then the PWMI are released a short time later in no different circumstances than when they were originally arrested. The PWMI are not benefitting from being in jail, other than maybe having a roof over their head, food, and possible medication for a short period of time; they are exiting the same as when they entered.  A comment that stood out to me: The community was appalled at warehousing PWMI in mental health institutions, but has no issue warehousing PWMI in jails. "
895,"The three key indicators I think jails should measure in regards to mental illness are: history and use of antipsychotic drugs, availability and accessibility to mental health services in the community, and repeated arrests and incarcerations for the same petty crimes.  I believe that jails should start by looking at the current offense, and the person's history of offenses, to determine if there is a discernable pattern. If the person has repeated arrests for petty theft, breaking and entering unoccupied properties, or disturbance of the peace, this can paint a picture in terms of mental illness. Most likely, a person being arrested over and over for these and similar crimes is suffering from homelessness or mental illness and needs to be treated in a mental health facility rather than being temporarily housed in jail and then re-released. The pattern of repeated arrests shows that the person is not benefitting or ""learning"" from his/her jail time, and something more effective needs to be implemented.  Jails should look at the availability and accessibility of mental health services in the community, or lack thereof, as an indicator of why a person might be committing petty crimes. If services are lacking or poorly maintained, jail personnel might be able to assume that the PWMI in their custody is not receiving adequate treatment for his/her mental health issues. The jail personnel should attempt to direct the person to better treatment rather than cycling him/her in and out of their facility.  Finally, I think jails should look at history and use of antipsychotics as a clear indicator of a mental health issue. The people currently or previously taking antipsychotics need to be treated differently. Programs need to be instituted in jails such that, even if a person is arrested and placed in jail rather than in a treatment facility, he/she can develop a long-term treatment plan that will help keep him/her from being arrested again in the future. "
896,"I think that this is a difficult issue to address. Obviously the top priority for most jails and prisons is going to be creating a safe environment for both the inmates and the officers. To create such an environment in a place where the residents are convicted criminals who are known to be deceptive, violent, or inconsiderate of rules, is especially taxing. I think that there currently seems to be a decent balance in terms of what rights prisoners keep and what rights they lose. It only seems fair given the fact that they (typically) willingly committed crimes knowing that they may be arrested and lose their rights. I believe it is fair to allow prisoners to continue to practice religion, and that monitored speech is an important right. I do not believe that prisoners should have unmonitored speech, as this would create a safety issue. I also believe that prisoners should not have a right to privacy, as this will also create issues for safety. "
897,"I think, despite the cost of medication, it is the most common form of treatment for PWMI in jails because it is the easiest treatment. Once medication is prescribed, it can be handed out by any prison staff regardless of training or expertise. It does not require consistent contact with a mental health professional. Additionally, I think it is commonly used because it can be used as a sedative for difficult to control PWMI, which takes the responsibility of controlling the PWMI inmate away from prison/jail personnel. This means that less money ""has to be"" spent on training personnel to handle PWMI effectively. It is really the lazy option. "
898,"Given the trend of available mental health resources and funding at state and county level jails, I believe that the current jail system is an inappropriate system for managing the needs of seriously mentally ill individuals. The week 4 lecture discussed Realignment policy and the change it sparked in California. This policy dramatically changed the population of people that were housed in local jails. Prior to Realignment, county jails were meant to only house those that were serving sentences of a year or less, or those awaiting trial, bail, or parole. Realignment stipulated that all non-serious, non-violent, and non-sex felons would serve their time in county and state jails. Not only did this cause a massive expansion in the population size of the local jails, it also changed the situation such that jails were housing a larger expanse of type of criminal, and housing them for much longer. Realignment strained local jail occupancy levels and budgets. These changes have a direct impact on PWMI, who are most commonly arrested for petty or nonviolent crimes and did their time in local jails.  Jails were not designed to house large groups of seriously mentally ill individuals (Slate et al., 2013). Funding is not available to provide adequate mental health services with properly trained mental health personnel. As mentioned in the text, the Consensus Project made recommendations that jails should provide, at minimum, immediate crisis and short-term treatment. Despite this recommendation, most inmates do not receive treatment.  Psychotropic medication is often the only form of mental health treatment in many jails, which offer temporary relief of symptoms and no long-term management of life or coping skills. Medication is often utilized because it provides quick relief. However, it eats up the largest portion of a jails budget, leaving little money left over for any other psychiatric treatment. Budget constraints also limit the amount of staff a jail can have on at any one time. Overworked, overtired, undervalued, and underpaid staff are a key component in mistreatment of inmates and lack of prevention of suicides (Slate et al., 2013). Architecturally, jails are not adequate for those suffering from mental illnesses. Overcrowding, constant noise, an inability to have privacy, rules that can be difficult for PWMI to follow, harsh discipline, and victimization by other inmates and staff are all stressors that can make it difficult for a PWMI to funct"
899,"Denise,  Thank you for your post. I appreciate that you pointed out the rights that inmates have within jails. These rights, as we learned this week, include the right to due process, a limited right to privacy, the right against sexual harassment, the right to health care, and the right to treatment or refusal of treatment. However, as you point out, the jail system walks a fine line between letting a PWMI decide whether or not to adhere to treatment, and the safety and security of the general population and the jail as a whole. Specific to PWMI, this week's lecture noted the Ruiz v. Estelle case, which set minimum standards for PWMI. These include screening and evaluation of inmates to identify who needs treatment, suicide prevention and treatment, appropriate use of medications, and maintenance of accurate and confidential mental health records. Slate et al. (2013) highlight inconsistencies in initial screenings, with different jails asking different questions, and different responses to positive indications of mental illness or suicidal thoughts. Those that were found to indicate mental health issues had to wait extended periods of time, from 1 day to more than a week for referrals for mental health assessments.  It is obvious that the current staff is undertrained and undermanned to meet the needs of the PWMI population. "
900,"Sayla,  Thank you for your post. You highlight the daunting progression into troublesome treatment of PWMI well. One point that really stands out to me is that point you make about PWMI being released with minimal medication and resources, leading to a cyclical pattern of incarceration and release. As highlighted in the text, adequate discharge planning is imperative to keeping PWMI from committing future crimes and ending up back in jail. An adequate plan includes continuity of services in the community, to include medication/ treatment, supervision, benefits and housing. As you, and the text point out, most PWMI are not leaving jail with an adequate discharge plan. In fact, in NYC in 1999, PWMI inmates were dropped off at the subway station with $1.50 in cash, a subway token, and no arrangements in place. This is an abhorrent disservice to PWMI, and, with the conditions they experience in overcrowded jails, serves to leave them worse off then before they were arrested. "
901,"Given the fluid nature of human nature, there is no 100% guaranteed assessment that has a zero error rate. I am not entirely positive there ever will be. Sometimes assessments will produce false positives, and sometimes assessments will produce false negatives. Neither false result is good for the person being assessed. In this way, I do not believe that it is ""fair"" to use assessment tools that are not 100% accurate - either a person is being deprived of liberty or the community is put at risk. However, just because they are not ""fair"" does not mean that I think we shouldn't use them. People that commit crimes have already shown that they are at a risk for criminal behavior. This fact alone shows that they need different treatment that the general community. Even if the test only has a 95% accuracy rate, this is better than not using a test at all and releasing dozens of dangerous individuals, or keeping all individuals in jail/prison until their hearing, which would clog the criminal justice system even more than it already is. "
902," I would like to believe that mental health professionals would be widely receptive to use of the RNR approach for PWMI in the criminal justice system. For PWMI, as stated in the follow-up video attached to this lecture, crimes are not more commonly committed due to violent tendencies or as a factor of the mental illness themselves. Crimes are committed in relation to the criminogenic needs of a PWMI, including homelessness, substance abuse, etc. Even if a PWMI receives treatment (i.e. medication) for their mental illness, their risk of recidivism is still affected by the criminogenic needs, which keeps PWMI stuck in the criminal justice loop. Therefore, I think mental health professionals would see the benefit of the RNR in that it addresses the criminogenic needs, while also providing mental health treatment. This appears to be the most rounded approach, as it addresses both the mental health needs of the PWMI, as well as their needs for housing stability, job stability, and substance abuse treatment. This covers the other factors besides recidivism that may be of concern for PWMI under supervision in the community. "
903,"Looking at how jails ""prepare"" PWMI for release in comparison to how probation is set up to address supervision and treatment needs, I believe that probation is the better option. As we have learned in previous weeks, many jails and prisons fail to properly develop discharge plans, which leaves many PWMI in positions where they simply cannot be effective in reintegrating in society and end up right back in jail. However, part of a probation officer's job is to help probationers find jobs and housing, as well as make sure that they adhere to treatment. This would be a better option for PWMI because it forces them to maintain treatment, as well as helps them find housing and jobs that reduce their criminogenic needs, all of which contribute to helping them abide by the law and refrain from getting arrested again. The factor that is important to keep in mind is that probation officers should be trained to handle any potential PWMI crises, in order to help PWMI stabilize and continue to abide by their probation regulations. "
904,"There appear to be both pros and cons to participating in mental health courts. If I was a participant, I believe that I would feel supported, due to the extensive treatment and rehabilitation services. I think I would feel less criminalized that if I participated in the traditional court processing system. However, I also believe that I might feel frustrated with the level of involvement and intrusion into my life from social workers and mental health providers. While participants in this program may retain their freedom, they are not entirely free, sometimes having to live in mandated housing, having to follow particular treatment plans, having to report to a probation officer or social worker constantly. I believe this would feel incredibly intrusive to my daily life in the community, trying to integrate and live normally. "
905,"RNR stands for risk-needs-responsivity model. This model hopes to increase the successfulness of rehabilitation programs by utilizing a more dynamic approach. The RNR approach has three components. The risk portion of the model includes both an assessment of risk and a match with an appropriate intervention. In this part of the model a criminal's future recidivism risk is assessed and then the offender is assigned appropriate interventions based on the assessed level of risk (Ogloff and David, 2004). An offender with a high predicted level of risk will be given intensive interventions, while an offender with a low assessed risk of committing future crimes will be required to participate in less intensive interventions (Ogloff and David, 2004). Need, as we learned in this week's lectures and readings, refers to an individual's criminogenic needs, or the needs that lead to a future risk of committing more crimes. Slate et al., (2013) highlights eight ""central"" needs or risks. The RNR model operates under the belief that, unless these needs are met, an individual will be likely to commit further crime to fulfil the needs (Ogloff and David, 2004). Rehabilitative RNR models address the needs specific to each individual. Finally, responsivity refers the an individual's ability to respond to a particular intervention (Ogloff and David, 2004). Factors related to responsivity can be both internal and external.  Effective interventions will be modeled in such a way that a person is able to get the most benefit from them.  Despite the apparent positive and effective nature of RNR models, Skeem et al., (2015) cautions against their use in populations of PWMI. His caution is aimed at the responsivity portion of the model, given that there is a large lack of empirical data supporting its effectiveness in populations of PWMI criminals. An issue, for instance, would be tailoring a persons medication such that he/she is able to participate effectively in a CBT group session even when experiencing acute psychosis (Skeem et al., 2015). Ultimately, the big issue is whether there is a misuse of the responsivity part of the model based on incomplete knowledge about how criminogenic needs and mental illness interplay (Skeem et al., 2015).  Based on this, my recommendation to the Chief Probation Officer would be as follows:  When assessing recidivism risk, it is imperative to utilize risk assessments that include assessments of mental health. Understand"
906,"Georgie,  Thank you for your response.  Something you brought up that really stuck out to me was the point about the availability of mental health services. As we know from previous weeks, there is a massive underfunding of mental health services, as state budgets are redirected toward the criminal justice system. With this in mind, it is hard to know what sorts of services would be available as well as the quality of these services. This would drastically hinder the effectiveness of the RNR model for PWMI, as they have different needs than the general criminal population. If mental health services are not available when they are needed, this would leave PWMI in a ""tough spot"" in terms of rehabilitation, leaving them more likely to violate the conditions of their probation or parole. "
907,"Karen,  Thank you for your post. I agree with your recommendation to focus not only on mental health treatment, but also on the environmental factors affecting PWMI. A PWMI could adhere to mental health treatment and take all the medications he/she is proscribed, but if he/she is jobless and homeless there is a higher risk of recidivism because a the person may need to commit a crime to fulfill a need. For example, in my paper last week I wrote about a PWMI that was arrested for criminal trespassing. The PWMI had been homeless for many years and was looking for a place to stay for the night. This was not his first trespassing arrest. Though he was also not abiding by his treatment recommendations, the homelessness created a need for a place to stay, and he committed a crime knowingly to fulfill the need. He was not hurting anyone, but it was still a crime. This case highlights the needs to focus on environmental factors when planning interventions for PWMI. It is imperative that they have a safe place to reside, but as a criminal and a person with a mental illness, they will need help securing housing. Once they have a stable living situation, it becomes increasingly easier to find work (with help), and adhere to mental health treatment. As you point out, it is useless to focus on one aspect, environmental or mental health, and it is imperative to address both in interventions for PWMI. "
908,"Aspects of prisons environments that might aggravate the conditions of PWMI include crowding, excess noise, strict rules that are difficult for PWMI to follow, harsh disciplinary procedures, inmate violence, lack of stimulating activity, and routines that do not fit with what a PWMI is used to. These environmental stimuli might increase anxiety or psychosis in individuals, or may increase depression and other negative symptoms as the PWMI struggles to fill the daily void/time within the prison walls. Harsh discipline may make it difficult for a PWMI to function or feel secure in the environment. "
909,"I do not think it is possible to truly rehabilitate prisoners with serious mental illness. This is because, whatever services they receive while in prison or jail, stop as soon as they are released. Mental illness is not something that can be treated temporarily and then goes away. It is generally a life-long affliction that must be dealt with on a daily basis. To assume that a person can receive treatment for a few months to a year and then be released back into the world where they have job and housing instability as well as stigmatized relationships that are doubly worse due to being a felon and a PWMI, is to live in a fantasy world. The prison system can stabilize PWMI and give them training in how to manage their mental illness, but without resources on the outside, there will be little long-term effectiveness. "
910,"It is difficult to balance solitary confinement's maintenance of order with the protection of the mental health of inmates. As it is used currently, I do not believe that there is an adequate balance. A better balance would ensure that there are limitations on how long a person can remain in solitary confinement. If a person is an immediate threat to the prison personnel or other inmates, he/she should be temporarily removed from the population with the use of solitary confinement. However, this segregation should be paired with specialized focus/treatment to diminish the dangerous behaviors or attitudes, such that a person can be released back into the main population as soon as is safely possible. Inmates should not be confined to the point of deleterious effects. "
911,"At the beginning of the video I was thinking that I wouldn't mind my tax dollars being spend on treating PWMI in the prison system. I thought that if this is the only avenue through which they are getting treatment, then it is better to spend the money than to not. However, when the video mentioned how cost effective it is to treat PWMI in the community rather than in the prison system, I realized that I would not like my tax dollars to go towards treating PWMI this way. I would prefer that my tax dollars go towards community treatment resources, such that PWMI can receive adequate treatment before getting arrested. This will not only save the state money, but will lower the stigma around PWMI, as they will hopefully be arrested less, and will allow them to continue to live functional lives while receiving treatment rather than having to be locked up to receive treatment. "
912,"I believe that PWMI should receive more resource allocation than other inmates not suffering from mental illnesses. This is due to the fact that the decrease in budgets for mental health treatment in the form of institutions or community resources has been directed to the criminal justice system. If PWMI are in jail or prison because the money that would have been used to treat them in the community has been redirected to jails/prisons, then the funding should be utilized toward their treatment within the CJ system walls.  The prison system could best meet the needs of PWMI, while also keeping other staff and inmates safe and keeping costs low by allowing the funding to be used toward treating PWMI in the community. However, since it is unlikely that a drastic change in fund allocation occurs, the best strategy would be to maintain separate mental health wards for PWMI. The Adams and Ferrandino (2008) article discusses the idea of environments as therapy. The premise is that certain institutional environments, especially those that are loud, crowded, violent, or stressful, have ill effects on PWMI who have a harder time socializing effectively with other inmates. Rather than spending a fortune on medications or creating more problems than they started with by using solitary confinement, prisons and jails should house PWMI in their own ward. Having a ward or cell block specifically dedicated to PWMI would not require additional facilities to be built, as a ward previously dedicated to other inmates could be utilized. The ward could then be staffed with correction officers that are trained in understanding and dealing with PWMI and only work in that particular ward. Having consistent staff would not only allow PWMI to develop trusting relationships with familiar faces, but would also allow the COs to develop understandings of the individuals over time. There would be less issues concerning whether an inmate is acting a particular way out of attention seeking or malingering motives rather than mental illness, since every inmate in the ward would have mental health issues. Additionally, PWMI would be less likely to be victimized because they would not be around the general population who does not understand their behaviors. Finally, the structure of the day could focus around other treatment opportunities without the disruption of nonPWMI. "
913,"Danielle,  Thank you for your post. You said exactly what I wanted to say - in a perfect world PWMI would not be incarcerated, they would receive the proper treatment they need in the community or in mental health institutional settings. In a perfect world, all of the money drained from mental health treatment and fed into the criminal justice system would be redirected back to where it came from and utilized in effective and scientifically proven means. Unfortunately, we do not live in a perfect world. I do agree that PWMI should receive ""more"" resources. However, I like how you have framed it less like they are getting extra, and more like they are getting what they need. If we were able to shift the mindset of the policy makers and prison/jail directors such that they saw mental health treatment as no different than medical treatment provided to any other inmate, then maybe we would get somewhere. "
914,"Natalie,  Thank you for your post. You brought up a figure that I was trying to remember in regards to the difference in costs between treatment in prison/jail and treatment in the community. A big part of this conversation focuses around the issue of providing the best possible treatment and outcome for the lowest possible price. However, what seems to be continually forgotten or under appreciated is the fact that it is exponentially cheaper to treat PWMI in a community based setting than it is in jails or prisons. Compounded on this is the fact that the level of treatment is most likely substantially better, more rounded (not focused entirely on medication), and less stigmatizing than receiving treatment in the confines of prison walls. It is my hope that more research on effective community based treatments is conducted, which can allow for the development of better community based services, which can ultimately lead to a reduction in PWMI arrests and better outcomes. However, the first step would need to be allocating funds from somewhere else to be directed at community mental health services, and I am doubtful that criminal justice funds will be diminished any time soon. "
915,"I was actually born in Missouri. I would support the construction of the new Fulton State Hospital. Just looking at the difference in the architecture between the old and new buildings is a massive difference. The old state hospital looks like a jail - it is not inviting and I would not feel enthusiastic about receiving treatment there. However, the new state hospital looks more inviting, which I think would leave patients feeling more open to going. Given what we have learned about the outcomes for PWMI since the massive reduction of state hospital beds, anything that betters the outcomes for PWMI would be acceptable. "
916,"I would not describe NGRI as a ""get out of jail free"" card because the defendant ends up still being confined for an extended period of time. The defendant does not get to go free - he/she is confined to a state hospital until he/she is no longer mentally unfit, or the maximum sentence he/she would have received if sent to jail or prison. Typically, people found NGRI spend more time in an institution than they would have spent behind bars. "
917,"To balance patient and staff safety with a proper treatment environment, I would start by making sure that there are always enough staff. There should never be a staff shortage in this type of environment. All the employees that work within the facility, regardless of their role, should receive training on how to deal with PWMI in various situations. Another option would be having the facility sectioned off, with residents residing in different areas based on level of dangerousness or ability to function without outbursts etc. In this arrangement, there could be increasing levels of freedom based on where the resident was. Patients that are less dangerous would have more freedom, which would allow for a more therapeutic environment. Patients that are perceived as more dangerous would have less freedom and more security. Patients in the high security area would receive treatments aimed at reducing dangerousness. The patients could then ""graduate"" to the more freedom locations as they show that they can function safely. "
918,"While I would initially feel uncomfortable with the idea of putting something in someone's brain, and all the possible risks that go along with brain surgery, I will say that, if it really works, then they should do it. I realize this is still experimental, but seeing the outcome for the women in the video is incredibly promising. I think they should continue to work with it. "
919,"Presently, the state hospital system is closely intertwined with the criminal justice system in that 90% of its residents are forensic patients (Week 8 Lecture). Forensic patients include those found Incompetent to Stand Trial, Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity, and Sexually Violent Predators. Those forensic patients that are incompetent are held within state hospitals as treatment or training is provided to return them to competency. They may remain in a state hospital for up to three years or the max sentence related to their offense. Those held in state hospitals found NGR remain there for the max sentence of their offense. Those committed to SVP statues are held under annual review of their mental state. With 90% of the state hospital population consisting of those that are involved with the criminal justice system, this may not create the therapeutic environment necessary for those that voluntarily commit themselves, or those noncriminal individuals who are involuntarily committed. The state hospital system should not be used exclusively for forensic patients, as it is necessary in providing safe, stable, long-term care for particular PWMI who cannot benefit from community-based services (Sisti et al., 2015). However, while it seems necessary to continue to utilize state hospitals for forensic populations, as it is a better location for receiving treatment than the prison or jail system (Fisher et al., 2009), there should be some sort of separation between forensic and non-forensic populations. This may entail separate housing or wards within a single state institution, or it may entail that there be separate institutions for forensic and non-forensic patients. Given that there are hundreds of state hospitals with a surplus of available beds (Fisher et al., 2009), it would make the most sense to close down and condense the population of PWMI within these facilities. A state hospital that houses forensic populations could be located further away from nearby cities, such that the minds of the local residents are at ease. On the other hand, a state hospital that houses non-forensic patients should be located closer to nearby cities or towns such that families can visit their loved ones and help in treatment.  To conclude, state hospitals, while currently housing a majority of forensic patients, should not operate exclusively for forensic patients. There remains a population of PWMI that cannot receive effective treatment in a community-based se"
920,"Briana,  Thank you for your response.  I do believe that allowing state hospitals to retain open beds for non-forensic patients would reduce the population of PWMI in the criminal justice system. As we have learned in previous weeks, deinstitutionalization, which was meant to reduce the population of residents within state hospitals and asylums by funding mental health care in community-based settings, has really just become transinstitutionalization (Sisti et al., 2015). Transinstitutionalization is the movement of PWMI from state hospital beds to general hospitals, emergency rooms and the criminal justice system. The impressive growth of PWMI populations in state prisons and jails is a direct consequence of not having proper treatment in the community and a reduction in available beds at mental health treatment facilities. If the state hospitals opened up more beds, it is possible that more PWMI would seek refuge and treatment there, rather than living homeless and committing petty crimes to survive on the streets. Of course, the state hospitals would need to make themselves more inviting to draw patients in. Ironically, if state hospitals admitted a larger non-forensic population, they would most likely house the same patients, just before the patient comes into contact with the criminal justice system. In other words, the same population would end up at the state hospitals, but they would do so before getting arrested, which would spare them the stigma and criminal record. "
921,"One of the points that stood out to me was the comment that there was someone in the jail/prison looking through the files to find any PWMI that are also in the MH agency files. I do not believe this is an adequate or effective method of sharing information between agencies. Not only does this process sound incredibly time consuming, but it is also easy to miss people that may have received MH services in different communities or even different states. Something that could be really easy could be to have a national database where every single PWMI that has received treatment is in the database, with even just their name listed and the location where they received services. Then, at intake in a jail or prison, each detainee's name is imputed into the database to see if they have previously received services. If they have previously received services, this database would allow the jail or prison to contact the location at which they received services in order to obtain more information and better understand the needs of the individual. This should, of course, not be the only intake inquiries about mental illness, as there are many people who never seek formalized treatment. However, I believe this would greatly reduce the number of PWMI that are not identified as needing mental health services, while also respecting privacy (by not providing any other information than a name and contact information for the location at which they received treatment). "
922,"The CIT approach appears not only like a longer encounter, but also a more understanding encounter. In the video, the PWMI is clearly agitated. Instead of coming into his home and immediately taking custody of the PWMI or putting him in handcuffs, the officers approach him calmly and slowly. One officer talks with the PWMI while the other removes the medications from reach. The officers state that they are there to help, and mention multiple sources of assistance that have nothing to do with being arrested. The interaction stems from a place of de-escalation rather than hostility or a desire to detain the individual as quick as possible. "
923,"I think there are many reasons why it often takes a court order or other legal actions for the Department of Corrections to change the way PWMI are treated. First of all, the DOC may not change because it does not know how to change effectively. Court ordered sanctions often have some sort of research backing guiding them, which would provide a direction of where to go. Without this direction, the DOC may simply not know how to change in an effective way. Additionally, the DOC may not have the staff or the budget to make changes. In this scenario, the DOC maintains the status quo until they are forced to do something different. Stigma may also be a big reason behind the stalling of change. "
924,"The biggest challenge I think MH workers face when treating patients in a correctional environment is the environment itself. To help the patient overcome the fact that they are in jail or prison, and still be receptive and open to treatment in such a way that it is effective is probably challenging. The MH workers might also be there because the patients have mandated treatment rather than treatment that they seek because they want it. The MH workers have to overcome this barrier and help the PWMI be open to the treatment even though they did not want it in the first place. Cross-training would help to keep a level of care and consistency even with the MH workers are not present. If the correctional staff understand where the PWMI is in treatment, and knows what he/she can do to help the patient maintain specific goals or stabilize when the MH worker is not present, then the PWMI may have a better outcome. Cross-training may also help in transitions from the prison cell environment to the therapy environment - bringing a PWMI to the therapy environment in an orange jumpsuit and cuffs is not very therapeutic. Teaching correctional officers how to transition the inmates will help to start off the treatment in a better headspace. "
925,"Liisa,  Thank you for your post. I am interested in the recommendation you make regarding the development of a program better suited to those forensic patients (incompetent to stand trial) that make up the majority of state hospital beds. It would seem that similar designations in the way that state hospitals are organized could be developed for other types of forensic and non-forensic patients. My first instinct is to say that there should be different hospitals for each type of patient, with each hospital tailored and run specifically to suit the needs of its type of patient. For example, there may be one hospital in each state dedicated to housing those found NGRI, and this would be run differently than the state hospital designated for IST. However, the issue of location and being far removed from family comes up. While I realize that there is not a state hospital near every city or located conveniently to anyone, having only one hospital per city for each type of patient would make it far less likely that any family would visit any of the patients. Having separate wings or buildings in the state facilities for each type of patient seems like another option that might lower the location and distance issue. However, the ultimate issue is the need to increase beds for non-forensic patients. Whether this means that they build a new hospital specifically for non-forensic patients, or the rearrange and reprogram the ones that already exist, something must be done. "
926,"Essential training for mental health and criminal justice actors must be in-depth and all encompassing. The first and most important aspect of training needs to be recognizing the signs and symptoms of mental illness. If a intake officer in a corrections facility, a defense attorney, or a medical professional do not recognize that a person is suffering from a mental illness and needs assistance, then the PWMI is unlikely to receive the treatment and help that he/she needs. The intake officer might miss signs and symptoms, failing to refer the inmate to further evaluation, which can place the inmate in a perilous situation where they are at risk of victimization, suicide, or destabilization from lack of medication. If a defense attorney fails to recognize symptoms of mental illness, they may assume incorrectly that the PWMI can successfully assist in his/her defense, or may fail to request a competency evaluation. This may result in negative outcomes for the PWMI, to include incarceration. Finally, if a MH provider does not recognize the signs and symptoms of mental illness in their patients, they may misdiagnose or provide the wrong treatment, which can have negative outcomes for PWMI.  The second essential aspect of training is to destigmatize mental illness. This is especially important with criminal justice actors. CIT training is an effective method of reducing the stigma associated with mental illness. This training not only has content specifically aimed at reducing stigma, but also allows officers to interact with PWMI that are not in crisis, so that the PWMI can be humanized.  Criminal justice actors should be trained in responding to PWMI crisis situations, both in public and behind jail/prison walls, as well as de-escalation techniques. This training is essential because a proper understanding of how to respond to PWMI in crisis increases the safety of both the officer/correction officer and the PWMI. Learning effective de-escalation techniques allows an officer to communicate with the PWMI and find out what they need, rather than arresting the PWMI or moving him/her to isolation. De-escalating the situation can prevent unwanted injuries and even death.  Finally, all actors that work with PWMI should have a knowledge of PWMI rights. This training is imperative to making sure that PWMI are treated with fairness and respect, as well as protected from unjust treatment or sanctions. Defense attorneys having an understanding"
927,"Elise,  Thank you for your response. You just got me thinking about the timing of location of mental health training and education. You mention that it is important to increase mental health literacy, and that the education system would be an effective avenue to do this due to the percentage of the population that participates in the school system, as well as the age at which the signs and symptoms of mental illness start to show. I think this is a brilliant idea, and harkens back to the discussion we had earlier on in the quarter about how and at what grade mental health education should take place. My current thought is that it is not only important to increase understanding and knowledge of the general population, but also for those children and young adults that are starting to experience signs and symptoms of mental illness. If we can decrease stigma and increase understanding for those kids that are starting to experience their first mental health symptoms, then we may be able to increase the likelihood that these individuals seek treatment. In other words, by allowing these kids to see that there is nothing to be ashamed of, etc. (lower stigma), we can increase the likelihood that they seek treatment early on, rather than hiding what they are experiencing for fear of judgement of misunderstanding. Helping these kids to seek treatment early on can increase the chance of a better outcome, and lower the chance that they ever find themselves cycling through the justice system in the first place. "
928,"Caroline,  Thank you for your response.  To answer your questions, I did a bit of research and came across an article that highlights the fundamental characteristics of effective de-escalation techniques. Price and Baker's (2012) thematic synthesis literature review highlights that a person trained in de-escalation needs to be, ""open, honest, supportive, self-aware, coherent, non-judgmental, and confident without appearing arrogant"" (pg. 312). This person must be trained in expressing genuine concern, and a trustworthy nature. Training personal control is also highly important, as the professional must be able to appear calm even in dangerous or highly tense situations. Not surprisingly, the article also highlights the use and training of a gentle/soft/calm tone of voice, as well as a proper understanding of body language. De-escalation techniques teach how to bond with a patient, even when the PWMI is displaying aggression. There are a host of other recommendations, including shared problem solving (finding out the reason for the aggression), communication encouragement, offering of alternatives to aggression, and limit-setting.  Your recommendation for a certification program seems promising - it could be required of all lawyers, judges, medical professionals, corrections officers, police officers, etc., before they can begin work in their respective field. What's one more class, right?    Price and Baker (2012). Key components of de-escalation techniques: A thematic synthesis.

929,"Steve,  Thank you for your response. You caught me there with my wording! While I still believe that the 4 main topics I discussed are the absolute necessary for a beneficial understanding of mental illness and PWMI, there are of course other topics that could be addressed. The reason I stuck with the main four is due to the understanding that any training is better than no training, and that it would be easier to lobby for a training covering the four main topics than it would be to lobby for training covering every single aspect of mental illness. While a certification program covering these four topics could be required of all actors that come into contact with PWMI, a more in-depth training seems overzealous and more likely applicable for those with an actual interest and want to work directly with PWMI. That being said, other areas of notable concern regarding training include: the overlap and interplay of mental illness and substance use, including what to look for, how to recognize when behavior is due to one or the other, or both, and how to respond to a PWMI with multiple needs; another topic for training is knowing and understanding what treatment and community based services are available, as is taught with a successful CIT program; finally, education should focus on early intervention for youths suffering from mental illness, including how to look for indicative behaviors, such that they can be treated before their mental illness leads them down the cyclical path of the criminal justice system. "
930,"I think the program focuses on non-violent offenders because these are the offenders that most likely committed crimes out of need based on their mental illness (trespassing for somewhere to stay, theft in order to get food), rather than violent crimes. These non-violent offenders are more likely than violent offenders to get what they need from treatment rather than from entering the criminal justice system. On the other hand, violent offenders are more likely to have committed a crime that requires restitution. "
931,"I think there are probably some differences in the hurdles for the CJ system and MH systems in implementing evidence-based practices. While I assume that both agencies have financial burdens, it is clear that the CJ system has a much larger budget than MH agencies. This can make it hard for MH agencies to implement programs effectively. However, I think both types of agencies are highly influenced by public opinion. "
932,"I think an integrated MH and Substance abuse model could change the way that the justice system screens each inmate that enters their facilities. Using standardized screening tools that successfully screen for both co-occurring disorders can not only help identify those that need treatment, but also identify those that need complex treatment or would be better served in a different facility. It can also change the way that the justice sees PWMI with a co-occurring disorder, seeing that not just as a person that has committed a crime, but a person that has a complex health history and needs help. "
933,"Peer mentoring can pair people that have similar backgrounds in mental health, or have been through similar traumatic events. It can help a person struggling with mental health issues to realize that they are not alone and that there is nothing wrong with experiencing what they are experiencing. It gives people the knowledge that it is safe to talk about what is going on and seek help. "
934,"I do not even know where to start! So many things could have prevented Timothy Souders' death. First and foremost, if someone is being placed in a psychiatric hold for the safety of themselves and others, I think it is vital that they are regularly evaluated by a psychiatrist and a physician. The fact that the resident psychiatrist was out for seven weeks does not mean that things could be overlooked. The prison should have appointed someone to fill the position temporarily until the facility psychiatrist returned. Who granted permission for this to occur and are they trained to do so? Additionally, Timothy Souders did not belong in a prison with those that are ill-equipped to manage his mental health issues. I highly doubt he was receiving the treatment and medication management necessary for him to be successful in managing his diagnoses. There should be a time limit on how long someone should be placed in restraints; again, being regularly evaluated by a psychiatrist and a physician. In my opinion, there is no excuse for what happened. It was apparent by watching the video that Timothy Souders was weakening each day, not only from laying flat for hours, but lack of stimulus, exercise, food and water. So many things and so many people could have prevented this tragedy."
935,"The provision of treatment and care for persons with mental illness has been driven by social, economic and cultural factors.  Those with mental illness were thought to suffer from evil spirits which were banished out by surgically opening people's skulls to let the spirits out. Mental health issues were thought to be related to body impurities for which laxatives and surgical procedures were recommended. In the Middle Ages, people were tortured and murdered as a result of their mental health. Mental health asylums were created with the initial goal of treating those with mental illness; however, they soon became places to house people who were simply labeled undesirable to society. Women were labeled as having mental health issues simply because they did not conform to society. "
936,"I do not believe the benefits of a national registry of mentally ill persons outweighs the costs. As noted in this lesson and the follow-up video, only approximately four percent of violence is committed by those who suffer from a mental illness. There is no fool-proof way to identify who may go on to commit a violent act, or who specifically that four percent is. I do not think all of the other individuals should have to suffer or be stigmatized as a result. Another major flaw is that having a registry will deter people from seeking treatment. It would actually be counterproductive to the intended goal."
937,"One of the biggest problems I believe needs to be addressed as a result of deinstitutionalization is education. I believe the community needs to be better educated about the facts surrounding mental illness. In Crystal Dieleman's TED Talk, she addressed that safe & secure housing, structure, employment opportunities, relationships and autonomy are needed so those diagnosed with mental illness can be successful in the community. I believe each of these needs can be improved by better educating the public. Perhaps then landlords or employers would be more comfortable renting to or hiring those who suffer from a mental illness. Maybe others would be more accepting of developing friendships and relationships, and allow those with mental illness to have a great sense of autonomy. Media personnel should also be better informed so that mental illness is not portrayed a trigger for crime and criminal behavior. "
938,"Society's willingness to consider those with mental illness full-fledged members of society has evolved over the years, though I believe there is still a great deal of progress that needs to be made.  In the Pre-Civilization era, those with mental illness were thought to be possessed with evil spirits, banished from society or even put to death.  Ancient civilizations viewed mental illness as impurities in the body that could be cleansed with laxatives or surgery. In the Middle Ages, thought reverted back to believing the person was overcome by evil spirits. Others were considered witches because they did not fall in line with the ""norms"" of society. I believe people at that time tried to find explanations for what they did not understand, perhaps believing that the actions of mental illness could only be attributed to something evil or scary. Those with mental illness were not seen as people, but rather something people wanted out of sight, out of mind; something to get rid of.  Although the Renaissance Era evolved from torture and murder, those will mental illness were still banished from society and placed in asylums. Again, people who were not ""well"" enough to be a member of the community. With new knowledge, science and medical advancements, we are now able to  better understand the mechanisms of mental illness, and are moving forward towards integrating those who were previously jailed, hospitalized or in asylums, back into the community. However, do we consider them full-fledged members of society and allow them autonomy, unfortunately not. I believe we are on a path to getting there, but are not there yet. The data is there. Those with mental illness are not people to fear and are responsible for an extremely small percentage of crimes. It is a matter of getting the information to the public, and refraining from portraying those with mental illness in a negative light. Although the views are still not as extreme as in the past, mental illness is still an unknown and scary to many individuals just as it had been ages ago. I believe education is key in creating a more accepting environment.  "
939," McKenna -  I enjoyed reading your post and thought you offered a unique and interesting perspective regarding self-determination of those with mental illness and a self-fulfilling prophecy. I would imagine it is definitely possible for those with mental illness to begin fitting into labels created for them. However, I absolutely believe that PWMI are seen by members of society through the lens of their diagnoses. Your example about the patient found pacing because they are bored, then labeled as exhibiting a symptom, is a prime example of this. The nurse viewed them through the lens of a person with a mental illness, rather than considering the person as an individual and attributing their behavior to something in the context of ""normal."" If the nurse's family member, one who has not been diagnosed with mental illness, was found pacing in the home, would she immediately believe the person has a mental illness? I would assume not. She would likely see the pacing as someone who may be upset about something, someone who is anxiously waiting to tell someone some exciting news, or in fact, actually ask the person what is causing them to pace. I believe examples like this demonstrate that PWMI are not given autonomy or the chance for self-determination. PWMI, and their actions, are viewed as a product of their diagnoses."
940,"Amber, Thank you for your post! I agree that public perception of PWMI is influenced greatly by the media. As we read in ""Untangling Gun Violence from Mental Illness"", mass shootings and violence are often attributed to people with mental illness. However, those with mental illness only make up a small percentage of actual violent crime. The reality I see is that media can put whatever spin they want on a news story, and the mere implication that the offender may have suffered from a mental illness is enough to make the connection between the two. A study by Chan and Yanos (2013) found that priming of news stories suggesting that a person may be mentally ill was enough for the individual/society to believe that mental illness was related to the violent incident, regardless of facts to support. In order for PWMI to be viewed differently by society, I believe the information provided to society has to be informative, factual and unbiased. This would be a small step in changing the stigma that has been ingrained society for so long. Chan, G., & Yanos, P.T. (2018). Media depictions and the priming of mental illness stigma.  Stigma and Health, 3(3), 253-264."
941,"Presidents can be effective in bringing an end to the stigma of mental illness by doing simply what President Obama did in the lesson video; speak about it. Talking about mental illness and educating the public on truths of mental illness, particularly from someone in a high authority, can go a long well in helping to diminish stigma. I liked Present Obama's example of how if someone had a broken arm, they would seek medical treatment, and similarly, so too should someone with a mental illness. I think this analogy put the concept into perspective and made it easy to understand and relate to the general public."
942,"Reducing benefits for mental health care creates a perspective that PWMI are not ""worthy"" or valued enough to be considered an area of need in society. These cuts would only further add to the stigma associated with mental illness. If other health care initiatives are deemed more important, it reinforces the concept that PWMI are ""not treatable"" or not worth saving."
943,"Given service member's experience with medication for mental illness, I would recommend a more therapeutic approach. I think it would be beneficial to provide therapy before, during and after service. Additionally, I like the suggestion made by the veteran in the video and believe that group therapy consisting of other veterans would also be beneficial."
944,"I am torn on this question. I have had experience with someone who suffers from schizophrenia, who lacked insight into their illness, and who failed to seek treatment. I remember thinking to myself that someone needs to step in and ensure this person gets the help they need. Thinking that perhaps if their illness was under control, they could gain a better understanding and insight into their treatment needs. However, on the other end of the spectrum, I do not believe people should be forced to do something against their will and given the failures of the mental health system, I am not entirely convinced they would receive the treatment they need. Maybe efforts could be focused on connecting the individual with family/friends that could be supportive, providing regular check-ins and monitoring by mental health professionals, and  thinking outside the box to alternatives rather than forcing treatment."
945,"Given the various forms of stigma attached to PWMI, I believe it is essential that all schools teach students the facts and myths surrounding mental illness. I go back to the Obama video we watched earlier in this lesson. Being able to convey the information at a level that people can understand is important, particularly when we are talking about youth. If you have a broken arm, you go to the doctor. If you have a mental illness, you do the same.  They are both medical conditions and should be treated as such. Obviously the complexity and level of information conveyed should be tailored to each specific educational level. Just as students receive sex education, they too should receive mental health education starting at a young age and continuing through graduation. As noted in one of this week's readings by Rusch, Angermeyer and Corrigan (2005), I also believe contact with individuals who suffer from mental illness may go a long way in alleviating stigma. Perhaps the class could have a guest speaker or maybe even the teacher of the class could be someone who suffers from mental illness. This will allow students to not just be told information, but to also ask questions of their own, to interact, and to form their own opinions."
946,"Hi Janee, I enjoyed reading your post. Your comment about videos triggered me to think of how the media can play a role in educating our youth. In addition to programs being instituted in elementary, middle and high schools, I think a targeted effort to educate our youth through media could prove beneficial. Given the age of electronics we find ourselves in, perhaps more positive portrayals of those with mental illness in television, movies and and the media could steer public perceptions from an early age. Although data is limited on portrayal of mental health in children's media, I found an article that specifically mentioned Disney movies and their depiction of mental illness. Examples included Beauty and the Beast, Mary Poppins and Dumbo, all include ""mad"" individuals (Wahl, 2003). The stigma is there without us even realizing it! It begins at an early age in unassuming Disney movies where children are taught that being ""mad"" or mentally ill is something to fear. I think our education effort needs to be collective in targeting not only our youth's educational environments, but also how mental health is portrayed to youth through media. Wahl, O. F. (2003) Depictions of mental illness in children's media.  Journal of Mental Health, 12(3), 249-258."
947,"Hi Elise, You bring up and interesting point. Given that each state and their curriculum is different, this would most likely be a roadblock to ensuring that all children are given the same educational message. I too believe that certain states or school districts may choose not to implement this curriculum. I think it would be important to involve the United States Department of Education, although they typically do not deal with establishing educational curricula.  The Department of Education did establish the No Child Left Behind Act which required states to to give standardized testing in order to receive federal funding. Funding is a huge motivator and if there is a way to limit funding based on whether schools implement mental health awareness, it may help to ensure the message is heard across the board. Great post!"
948,"Based on the video and the information relayed in this lesson, I think it is evident that neither option is ideal. The result is a trade off regarding which is the lesser of two evils. Do we make the equation more sensitive, but less specific, or more specific and less sensitive? Either way, there are going to be false positives and false negatives. If civil commitment were determined based on these principals, it is likely that non-dangerous people will be committed and those that need commitment and treatment will be missed. When first looking at the percentages in the video (90% true positives, and 83% true negatives), the numbers do not seem so bad. However, when given the example of breast cancer testing, the remaining 10% and 17% could end of being quite a large number of people who were either falsely diagnosed with cancer (13,000) or those who had cancer that were missed (118). "
949,"I can definitely see both sides of this perspective; however, I lean more towards believing that involuntary commitment of sex offenders after completion of their sentences  is not a favorable option. Although I understand that there are two different systems involved, mental health and criminal, I do believe that additional commitment after successfully completing one's sentence constitutes a form of double jeopardy. I believe that money would be better spent expanding on current probation standards. I read an article about Chelsea's Law which was referenced in the video. When her murderer, John Albert Gardner, was released after his first sexual offense, he was given parole but was considered a high control parolee. However, Mr. Gardner violated the conditions of his parole on at least seven times and was not returned to jail. I think the right mechanisms are in place, but we are not utilizing them correctly and lack the funding and resources to monitor parolees successfully. I understand concerns that society has for their safety, but better monitoring, face to face contact, polygraph examinations and any other tools available should be used rather than placing these individuals in involuntary commitment under the guise of mental health treatment. It appears that for SVPs, involuntary commitment is just an extension of jail and the ""services"" and treatment they are supposed to be receiving while committed is minimal at best.  https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-gardner-not-kept-short-leash-2010mar13-htmlstory.html"
950,"I would definitely consider inpatient commitment a larger reach of state authority. Inpatient treatment takes away a person's ability to remain independent. Although there are certainly people who possess a danger, based on the inpatient commitment lesson from this week, I am not convinced that inpatient commitment is solely mandating treatment for those who are a danger to themselves or others. We learned that general criteria for commitment contains a very broad definition of mental illness. In my opinion, this could make it easier for individuals who do not belong in inpatient treatment to fall between the cracks.  Being  confined to involuntary commitment because no friends or family were willing and able to provide care and assistance. Additionally, depriving a person of their autonomy has to at least in part, be detrimental to treatment. For individuals who are attached to family, their pets or even just their own belongings, being deprived of those things or connections may in fact add additional trauma to an already traumatized individual. With outpatient commitment at least the individual can sleep in their own bed, have dinner with family and engage, in everyday activities while still receiving the treatment they need."
951," The overall goal of involuntary commitment, whether inpatient or outpatient, is to protect the individual, to protect society, and to provide necessary treatment; however, whether either option accomplishes this goal remains debated. Involuntary inpatient commitment for individuals who at literally at a point where they could hurt themselves or someone else may be a necessary option. Additionally, if a person is so severely suffering from a mental illness to the point where they are unable to care for themselves, then again, involuntary commitment may be necessary. However, it seems as though this option should be used only in extreme cases as depriving someone of their basic autonomy and freedom seems contradictory to the overall goal. A measure of success for involuntary treatment should be the absence of the immediate threat. Is the person no longer a danger to themselves or others? Have the initial concerns dissipated to the point where the individual can function in society and still receive the treatment they need. This would help to ensure both society and the individual are “safe” and that the PWMI receives the care necessary for their success. Involuntary commitment should be more of a short-term measure, not a five year plus endeavor. The overall goal being that the PWMI understands the need for treatment and has the ability to engage in such treatment without coercion.   Outpatient involuntary commitment appears to have more data that supports the effectiveness of its use. It allows the individual to remain in society and function in their day to day lives, but also mandates that they participate in treatment. Much like involuntary commitment, outpatient commitment is forced and coercive by nature; however, not to such as drastic extreme as inpatient commitment. It has shown to increase engagement in treatment, increase medication compliance, reduce criminal victimization as well as homelessness (Lesson 3.3). These results are appropriate measures of success. If administered as intended, outpatient involuntary commitment should reduce the likelihood of inpatient hospitalization as well as diminish chances of relapse."
952,"Hi Steve, Great point and one I often deal with in my job as well. The word ""immediate"" is key. Are they a danger to themselves or others in that moment? There have been instances where we have sought to have someone hospitalized because they were a danger, but we sat waiting in the emergency room for so long, they were no longer considered a threat because the danger had subsided. Perhaps this person would then be better suited for outpatient commitment? There is obviously something going on that triggered the concern, but maybe not to the point where they would have to be committed on an inpatient basis. I am curious if you are aware of whether the individuals you discussed were actually admitted or determined to not be a threat and were eventually released? It is sad to think in terms of liability, but if I were the officer in those situations, I would rather be safe than sorry as well. The ultimate decision is left to the doctors and they can determine if the individual meets the criteria for hospitalization. "
953,"Hi Ka, The pros for inpatient commitment that I mentioned were that if someone were an immediate threat to themselves or someone else, or if they are unable to meet their own basic needs, they can receive the immediate help they need. However, a con I mentioned was that the basic freedom and liberties are removed and inpatient commitment is forced and coercive in nature."
954,"Hi Stephanie, You brought up a great point about the measure of success in outpatient commitment is to ensure there is enough staff to adequately handle the clients.  As noted in this weeks lecture (3.3), the availability of resources is key for outpatient commitment to be effective. Many communities lack the resources to successfully implement outpatient care and laws do not guarantee services. Although I am not sure if this speaks to effectiveness of the patient's treatment, but I do think it speaks to whether the process should even be used in certain instances. If the resources are not available, I highly doubt the treatment and end results will be effective. The question is then, what happens when there are no outpatient resources available? Do these individuals automatically get placed in inpatient treatment so they can receive the services they need? It seems drastically unfair to remove an individual's autonomy simply because the options are not available to do otherwise. I am not sure what the answer is other than to devote more financial resources to ensuring that more outpatient treatment resources are available in each jurisdiction. Great post!"
955,"I think it would be most difficult for a PWMI to navigate the adjudication process. In the adjudication process, the defendant chooses to plead guilty, not guilty, or no contest.  As we learned in one of our previous courses, plea bargaining can be coercive and difficult even for someone who does not have a mental illness. It may prove challenging for a PWMI who does not think rationally and is unable to know or determine what is in their own best interest. During this phase, the PWMI may also have to go to trial depending on their plea. I would imagine going to trial is very overwhelming, confusing and scary. Someone suffering from a mental illness may be unable to manage the anxiety and ambiguity surrounding trial. The stress alone could lead a PWMI to decompensate. "
956,"The challenge associated with California's shift from state to local jurisdictions for PWMI is funding and resources. As reported in the video, funding for clinics has been cut and therefore, the services are not available for PWMI. Instead, they are housed in a facility that is not adequately equip to address their needs and patients are placed in ""rubber rooms"" when they are off their medications or unstable. One possible benefit is that as we learned in Week 2, PWMI and their crimes are generally not violent. As a result, they could possibly be placed in a category whereby they may be eligible for early release. This would allow PWMI to receive community based treatment rather than serving extended jail time. "
957,"If a PWMI is involved in a situation whereby they are a threat to themselves or someone else, I do think a police presence is necessary. However, if the concerns are simply about a person's mental state and well-being (i. e. they are living in the community park and talking to people that are not there) then I do think it would be more appropriate for a mental health professional or mobile crisis team to be the first responders. My answer leans more towards ""it would depend on the circumstances."" I think police response is required in some situations, but in others, it may in fact create more issues or intensive the situation and should be handled by someone trained in the mental health profession."
958,"CIT and stigma are related in that one of the benefits of CIT is that it reduces law enforcement stigma towards PWMI. Having the knowledge and training to understand signs and symptoms of mental illness, psychotropic medications, and de-escalation techniques likely instills more confidence in officers dealing with PWMI. If an officer arrives at a scene believing the stigma that a PWMI is dangerous and crazy, they are more likely to behave accordingly. If officers understand all components of the illness, how to manage those in crisis and the knowledge that PWMI are not necessarily violent, they will be able to respond in a calm, less tactical manner."
959," I do not think the use of the CIT model for PWMI should be stopped or even changed as a result of the Taheri study. The author does not recommend discontinuing the program, but rather utilizing more thorough evaluations to measure the outcomes. Only a small number of studies were eligible to be included in Taheri’s analysis, and definitions of what constituted CIT interactions were varied. The difficulty in measuring the effectiveness of CIT is that different agencies utilize different methods, terminology and measures (Rogers, McNeil, & Binder, 2019). In order for a more accurate analysis, implementation of a universal CIT curriculum and terminology may be beneficial.  A major goal of CIT is to reduce fatal incidents involving officers and PWMI. In 2018, there were approximately 1,000 fatalities that occurred as a result of officer-involved shootings. Approximately 25% of those fatalities involved PWMI (Rogers et al., 2019). Although there is no indication that CIT actually reduces the use of force or the number of arrests, there are other major benefits regarding the use of CIT (Taheri, 2016). CIT has been shown to reduce officers perceptions and stigmas of PWMI, and it has been shown to increase access to mental health services for PWMI (Rogers et al., 2019). Officer’s self-satisfaction in their abilities to deal with PWMI and not resorting to using force has also been positively correlated with CIT (Rogers et al., 2019).  Many CIT programs are voluntary and perhaps this factor also skews the measurable outcomes. As Taheri (2016) points out, those that volunteer may already be more prone to have less negative beliefs/stigma towards PWMI and may already be utilizing CIT methods without formal training. It may be that the individuals who actually need the CIT training to more effectively do their job, are not the ones receiving the service. A more realistic sample of CIT’s effectiveness would be to compare the results of voluntary versus involuntary participants after CIT training and implementation. This may give a better sense, particularly for those who are more prone to stigmatizing PWMI, if the training does change perceptions and job performance.  Rogers, McNeil, & Binder (2019). Effectiveness of police crisis intervention training programs. Journal of the American Ac"
960,"Hi Wendy, I agree that the use of CIT should continue. You expressed some apprehension about the program based on the results from the Taheri (2016) study and the lack of measured results of the program. One thing that I considered, and you also touched on in your post, was that perhaps the effectiveness is not being evaluated in a way that accurately depicts the positive results of the program. Taheri (2016) mentioned that CIT is primarily a voluntary program. Maybe the individuals that volunteer already have less stigmatized perceptions of PWMI and are utilizing methods that demonstrate this without even receiving formal training. They may be more open to change. What I think would be beneficial is if a study is conducted involving voluntary versus non-voluntary participants of the program. It could be that the people who would actual benefit from the training, who are most prone to stigmatizing PWMI, as well as initiating the use of force with PWMI are not the individuals receiving the training. This may give a more realistic interpretation of whether the training is actually effective in changing the beliefs and actions of those individuals. Just a thought! Thanks for your post."
961,"Alyse, I completely agree that more research should be conducted before making conclusions about CIT's effectiveness. There have been some positive outcomes measured and that convinces me that CIT should be further explored. Of the over 800 records Taheri reviewed for the meta-analysis, only eight actual contained enough information to evaluate whether CIT has reduced use of force, reduced arrest and reduced injury (Rogers, McNeil, & Binder, 2019). Clearly, the research is not consistent across all areas and perhaps more efforts need to be made to ensure data is collected and measured using the same criteria.  Rogers, McNeil, & Binder (2019). Effectiveness of police crisis intervention training programs.  Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law Online, 47(3). DOI:10.29158/JAAPL.003863-19.  "
962,"I cannot even begin to imagine what it must be like to be arrested and jailed more than 100 times. I would assume that frustration and resignation would eventually overcome the person. Frustration in that the system has failed them, especially in situations described by the sheriff such as being arrested for stealing food so that you can eat or breaking in somewhere so you have a place to sleep. Many of these ""crimes"" are preventable. I could also imagine being resigned to the fact that jail has become somewhat of a second home, and an inevitable process if you do not have employment, housing, food or suffer from mental health or substance related issues."
963,"Three indicators that jails should measure include recidivism rates, inmate safety and the percentage of inmates suffering from a serious mental illness. These three indicators are important for a number of reasons. Recidivism rates will give a better idea of whether ""the system"" is working or if we are just recycling inmates in and out of the system. Inmate safety/incidents is also important to determine the quality of care that inmates are receiving. Finally, the percentage of inmates suffering from a serious mental illness can determine appropriateness of care.  It can help answer questions as to whether jails are appropriate for those with mental illness, are the inmates receiving the medication and treatment they need, and as with recidivism rates, are jails providing the level of care necessary to reduce the chance of re-incarceration."
964,"I do not believe that inmates are given too few or too many rights. I think there is relatively a good balance of rights provided in prison such as free speech, the right to treatment, the right to due process, etc. Given that jail is supposed to be for people who have committed crimes, I do believe their rights should be somewhat limited. Though I understand that jail has become somewhat of a housing facility for those suffering from mental illness,  and I question whether their rights should be similarly limited, I can understand the need to maintain order and safety within the jail walls."
965,"Medication is the most common form of treatment for PWMI in jails because it is the easiest. It requires less personnel and time than regular counseling or psychiatric services. Jails can dole out medications with the hope that it will alleviate some of the PWMI's symptoms, but does not take away from the time necessary to manage the inmates and to ensure their safety."
966,"I believe jails are inappropriate for persons with serious mental illness for a number of reasons. In terms of funding, jails are not appropriately funded to adequately manage those with mental illness. Realignment in California is a prime example of this. Realignment shifted the financial burden from state to local jail facilities, and counties were not provided the funding necessary to manage this influx in inmates (Lesson 4.2). Jails have become overcrowded and a lack of funding has seriously hampered their ability to serve the population of inmates. As it relates to architectural concerns, jails are generally smaller than prisons and understaffed. Short-terms stays of inmates creates a more chaotic environment which likely impacts the progress of PWMI and their stability. Those with mental illness are more prone to victimization and assaults when incarcerated which I can imagine is only amplified in such a small setting with limited staff (Raphael & Stoll, 2013). California's realignment also sent lower level felons to local levels (Lesson 4.2). This could significantly impact crime and safety concerns in the local jail system. Operational constraints in the jail system may be the most significant negative impact on PWMI. PWMI require screening, treatment, prevention and medication. In a facility that is overcrowded and understaffed, it is likely that these measures take a back seat to safety of inmates and staff. They have to prioritize, and mental health treatment surely does not come in at the top of the list. As a result, inmates may not receive the initial screening necessary when they enter the jail to determine if they do or do not suffer from mental illness (Lesson 5.4). Mental illness could be missed and misdiagnosed. As discussed in one of this week's lecture questions, medication has become the primary source of treating those with mental illness. This may be in large part to under-staffing, and lack of trained personnel to counsel those with mental illness. Discharge planning is another area that is lacking due to overcrowding and under-staffing. The Counsel for State Government recommends that discharge planning occur throughout the course of the inmates stay. However, this requires manpower and ample staff. If discharge planning does not occur, PWMI return to the same problems and the same environment that contributed to their initial incarceration."
967,"Hi Clara, It is interesting to hear the perspective of someone who is in law enforcement. You brought up many great points in your post. I was a bit confused because you noted that jails were not appropriate places for those with mental illness, but also said that you believe those who are mentally ill and commit crimes should be jailed. I am curious what your response is to the video we watched in this week's lesson. When the sheriff stated that many people incarcerated with mental illness are there due to very minor infractions. For example, he mentioned stealing to have something to eat, or breaking and entering to have somewhere to sleep. Do you still believe those are examples of when individuals should be jailed and pay their debt to society? Technically, they have committed a crime, but some would argue it is a crime of necessity rather than something that is a blatant disregard for society. Curious to hear your thoughts. Thanks for your post!"
968,"Hi Eva, Great, comprehensive post! I really liked how you addressed the issues of punishment and isolation that could result from operational restraints, lack of overall staff, or staff that are limited in what they can manage due to overcrowding. I mentioned something similar in my post in that I think the overall functioning of the jail and safety are what jail personnel may see as of prime importance. Not realizing that unaddressed mental health issues will likely turn into safety concerns. I think it would be valuable for all jail personnel to participate in the CIT training that was discussed in Lesson 4.4. I honestly have no idea what type of training staff in jails receive, but I think it would be important as you said, to realize the difference between someone who is blatantly disregarding rules versus someone who is suffering from a mental health issue. Hopefully, with some training, the approaches could be different and staff would be better able to recognize a mental health crisis. Thanks for your insightful post!"
969,"I think that risk assessment tools are not necessarily fair; however, there needs to be some tool used to help the criminal justice system better determine who might present a risk upon release versus who may not. I doubt any tool is going to be 100% effective when dealing with people and personalities. I risk assessments should be utilized in conjunction with other tools and should not be the sole manner with which dangerousness is determined."
970,"I would hope that mental health professionals would be receptive to the RNR approach with PWMI. If it helps improve public safety, recidivism rates, and PWMI then I believe it will be accepted. In addition to recidivism, mental health professionals would be concerned with criminogenic factors, more serious offenders, and how best to provide treatment that coincides with the offenders ability and learning style (Lesson 6.1)."
971,"I really do not think the video provided enough information for me to discern if they are adequately set up to supervise and treat people with mental illness. I think the intent is there, to manage PWMI in the community rather than placing them in jails or prisons. The video referred to probation officers as criminal justice behaviorists. Again, I think the intent is there; however, with about 400,000 individuals under probation for felony offenses, I doubt there are enough probation officers to adequately supervise those individuals. It sounds better than jail in that probation officers create case plans and link individuals to services, which is sorely lacking in the jail system. I do think the idea of specialty caseloads as discussed in this lesson, which provides more training to probation officers while also allowing them to engage more with offenders would be more beneficial than standard probation."
972,"I would most definitely prefer mental health court to traditional court processing. The focus is on treatment rather than punishment, and support is provided in every facet of the individual's life. I do see the concern about the stigma attached with mental health court, but there is also a stigma attached with jail and criminal conviction. Mental health court deals with the root of the problem, rather than the actions and gives people with mental illness an opportunity to get necessary treatment, housing, employment and other necessary components for their long-term success."
973,"Given the caution about RNR discussed in the Skeem (2015) article, I would suggest to the chief probation officer that they use mental health treatment in conjunction with correctional services as proposed by Skeem (2015) to monitor people with mental illness on probation. Mental health treatment and medication management should still be utilized, particularly as the RNR model requires more research to determine its effectiveness. RNR involves determining an individuals risk level, as well as their needs to help eliminate recidivism.  Although there may be a lack of evidence to support the use of RNR as a whole, there are avenues within the model that have proven effective. For example, CBT or behavioral approaches have proven most effective in reducing recidivism (Skeem et al., 2015). I would advise that this method be used as it builds on the individual's strengths and tailors the treatment based on the individual's level of motivation, compliance, age, etc. (Skeem, 2015). The level of treatment depends on the level of responsivity. Additionally, Skeem (2015) discusses R&amp;R or Reasoning and Rehabilitation which is designed specifically to address cognitive limitations associated with mental illness. According to Skeem (2015), R&amp;R has been shown to reduce verbal aggression and pro-criminal attitudes. This approach teaches individuals problem-solving  skills and critical thinking that are essential to making better life choices. The approach can be tailored to meet the needs of each individual and their level of capability.  RNR focuses on criminogenic risk factors such as antisocial behavior or personality, poor school or work performance, family or marital discord, antisocial associates and few leisure and recreational activities (Lesson 6.1) Skeem cautions about focusing solely on treating criminogenic needs. Skeem (2015) suggests that general risk factors such as substance abuse history and violence history in combination with mental illness can raise an individuals likelihood to commit a crime. Treating mental health without addressing the need for substance abuse treatment or modifying ""criminal thinking"" will likely not result in the desired outcome. All needs should be taken into account and addressed whenever possible. Skeem refers to a study done by Sacks and colleagues that monitored 134 inmates. The study found that inmates that only participated in psychiatric treatment had a recidivism rate of 33%. Those that participated in"
974,"Hi Wendy, I also suggested the use of the CBT model as it has proven to have the largest effect size at reducing recidivism (Skeem, 2015). CBT programs teach problem-solving skills, interpersonal skills, as well as self-care and management. As noted by Skeem (2015) CBT is a treatment that overlaps both correctional as well as mental health treatment. At this point, given the lack of conclusive evidence to support sole use of RNR, it seems prudent to utilizes approaches that target both the mental health and correctional population, especially given that risk factors for recidivism are shared by both those with and without mental illness (Skeem, 2015). Great post!"
975,"Alyse, I really liked the approach you discussed. I had not mentioned specialty officers in my post, but I think the need is definitely there. Not only will specialty officers be more thoroughly trained in understanding PWMI, but they are able to spend more time engaging with the individual to work on problem-solving and solutions. As we have learned in past lessons, gaining access to housing, employment and benefits can make a huge difference in the life of a PWMI. Specialty officers work more closely with PWMI to obtain these necessities which will likely enhance their chances of success and in turn, reduce their recidivism rate. Great post!"
976,"Prison environments likely exacerbate symptoms of PWMI. Being locked away from all that you know can make symptoms of depression, anxiety, hopelessness and worse. The noise, the lighting, and simply the need to survive can aggravate symptoms of mental illness. Solitary confinement, as mentioned in the video can be extremely detrimental to PWMI. It is likely difficult for those who do not suffer from a mental illness, but being isolated and stripped of everything can precipitate even more issues. The severe punitive methods do not discount for someone with a mental illness. Punishments are the same whether the person is truly capable of understanding that what they are doing is wrong. I mentioned this in previous posts but jail personnel are also not trained to properly manage those with mental illness and likely cannot discern whether someone is being truly uncooperative and disrespectful or if their actions are a result of mental illness. This can lead the consequences like solitary that can have adverse effects on PWMI."
977,"I think it is possible, but all of the pieces need to fall into place in order to do so. Receiving an intake screening for mental illness is the first step, but maintaining regular treatment throughout the course of incarceration and receiving transitional services and treatment upon release are essential. We are no where near achieving this goal. As mentioned in the video, treatment participation is required but not forced. Additionally, there is very little monitoring that occurs following release."
978,"The disadvantages of isolation or solitary confinement outweigh the advantages. Although I can understand the need for order and safety, in my opinion, it appears to be the result of an ""easier"" solution for those maintaining and monitoring the prison environment. Essentially locking them up and throwing away the key. Isolating an individual for 23 hours a day seems cruel and inhumane to me. Not only are they in a sterile environment, without windows, they lack basic human connection. It is easy to see how, as described in the video, the brain begins to play tricks on the prisoner and the isolation likely intensifies symptoms of mental illness."
979,"I tend to think I would be more open to putting money towards community-based treatment programs with the goal of treating those with mental illness  before they get involved in the prison/legal system. I think tax dollars would be better spent on treatment, housing and employment opportunities for PWMI which may help to eliminate increased incarceration of PWMI. Given the place that we find ourselves, utilizing tax dollar to modify the current prison system is understandable. However, in the long-run, I think the money would be better spent on other avenues."
980," I do believe that prisoners with mental illness should receive more services and supports than the general population of inmates. PWMI who are incarcerated are the most difficult population to manage and are responsible for the most infractions (Lesson 7-3). As such, it would seem prudent to devote more energy and resources to this population which in turn, could increase the overall safety of staff and other incarcerated individuals. I think a Therapeutic Community approach (TC) as mentioned in the Adams and Ferrandino (2008) article would be beneficial. The article mentions, and we also discussed it in this week’s lecture question, that the prison environment can negatively impact PWMI. Prisons can exacerbate symptoms such as anxiety, depression, paranoia, anger, etc. which can increase acting-out behaviors. TC environments can reduce stress by creating lower levels of chaos and disorder (Adams & Ferrandino, 2008). They have also been shown to improve prisoners perceptions and increased positive interactions between prisoners and staff (Adams & Ferrandino, 2008).  In addition to environmental changes, I think that additional staff and staff training is a necessity. Not only will more officers be needed to manage environmental changes, but facilities should also be adequately staffed to screen individuals at intake, provide therapeutic support throughout incarceration and to provide aftercare services. The stark reality is that only about half of incarcerated PWMI are receiving the proper treatment (Lesson 7-4). Employing these services will not only help to better identify those with mental illness, but would likely prevent ongoing issues by ensuring that the PWMI is receiving the treatment necessary for their success. Staff training is another component that appears to be severely lacking. If correctional officers are better informed about mental illness they can better discern between “mad” and “bad” behaviors (Lesson 7-4). Implementation of officer education program have lead to decreased officer use of force and a decrease in bodily fluid battery by inmates (Adams & Ferrandino, 2008). All of these changes can increase the safety of prisoners and staff, while at the same time improve outcomes of PWMI.  Improving environments and increased staffing and supports would most certainly increase overall costs in the shor"
981,"Lisa, Although I tackled this question in a completely different manner, I totally agree with your approach. Ultimately, I do feel that more resources should be allocated to community-based supports in an effort to reduce the likelihood of PWMI incarceration. However, given the situation that we are in, with PWMI making up 7-45% of the federal inmate population and 16-56% of the state, it seems changes also have to occur within the prison walls (Lesson 7-2). I think no matter what approach is taken, costs will increase, but I think in the long-run, employing measures both within and outside of the prison community may help to reduce overall costs. I believe environmental changes, additional staff and staff training as well as more comprehensive treatment for PWMI who are incarcerated is a step in the right direction. Providing more community-based services in conjunction with this approach, though costly, in my opinion would have a favorable outcome. Great post!"
982,"Hi Niccole, I also agree that more resources should be provided to incarcerated PWMI. You mentioned that additional resources should be allocated to properly controlling PWMI. As we learned in this week's lessons, PWMI account for more incidents while incarcerated and are the most difficult group to manage (7-3). You did mention that they fail to screen inmates at intake for treatment needs, which I too feel is extremely important. Ongoing treatment throughout incarceration as well as aftercare services are also beneficial. I also suggested increased staff and staff training. I think devoting this number of resources will be costly at first; however, if done correctly, I think it will decrease prison incarcerations and ultimately reduce overall costs."
983,"I would be open to my tax money going to this facility. The hope would be that long-term costs related to crime and homelessness would be diminished as the mentally ill would not be cycling through the criminal justice system. So long as the facility is able to provide the necessary treatment, I think it is advantageous to open a more state of the art hospital."
984,"No, I do not believe Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity is a ""get out of jail free"" card. If someone is determined to be ""insane"" at the time of the crime, they did not understand their own actions and how those actions were wrong. It makes more sense to ensure that these individuals receive treatment in hospitals for their illnesses rather than being placed in prison. As we learned in previous lessons, jails and prisons are not equipped to deal with people who suffer from serious mental illnesses. Additionally, this week's lesson also noted that the individual's sentence is not wiped away, rather than are hospitalized for the length of their sentence."
985,"I think the biggest issues are those addressed in the video: lack of security, lack of staff and lack of properly trained staff.  In addition to the treatment providers, there needs to be enough staff to ensure the safety of both staff and residents. More funding and training measures need to be instituted to ensure the facility is run properly and fully staffed."
986,"I think it is great. Although it is still experimental, if it has proven to work, then I am all for it. To have someone report that they hardly ever smiled or laughed and didn't ""feel"" anything, and then everything changed after the brain stimulation treatment, is truly amazing. "
987," I do not think that state hospitals should exclusively be used for forensic patients. Although I most certainly feel there is a need for this population, I also think there are many other mental health illnesses that can be treated in a hospital setting. I would like to see a shift away from housing mentally ill in prisons and jails, and providing them community-based services or hospital treatment if necessary. The Sisti, Segal, & Emanuel (2015) article points out that ignoring how important these services are for people who are a danger to themselves or others and who cannot live and function on their own is truly doing a disservice to the mental health population. Those with milder mental health issues can be managed in outpatient care, while those that require inpatient care can receive those services in a state hospital. The prison system has become a revolving door for those suffering from mental illness (Lesson 8-1). Rather than continually housing mentally ill individuals in the criminal justice system that is not adequately equipped to manage this population, hospital settings can provide the treatment necessary so the individual may be able to function in society. If state hospitals are limited to only forensic patients such as those who are not competent to stand trial, not guilty by reason of insanity or sex offenders, there is a large population of patients that will be overlooked. Individuals who suffer from schizophrenia, major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder may not fall into one of the forensic categories, but may end up in the criminal justice system, homeless or in hospital emergency rooms as a result of their untreated mental illness (Lesson 8-4; Sisti et al., 2015).   Ideally, individuals should be screened upon entering the criminal justice system. If their mental illness prevents them from functioning in society without treatment or they fall under the forensic patient category, then I believe they should be diverted to a hospital setting where they can receive medication, therapy and treatment that is not so readily available in the criminal justice system. There are few long-term care options for the approximately 10 million Americans who suffer from a mental health diagnosis (Sisti et al., 2015). As a result, the criminal justice system and state hospital system need to work in tandem to serve this population of individuals and state hospi"
988,"Elise, I agree that state hospitals should not exclusively be used for forensic patients.  Although a large portion of individuals in state hospitals are forensic patients, I think limiting only these patients to hospital settings will likely overlook many who are in need of treatment. I argued that a shift needs to occur so that prisons are not the new mental health hospitals and treatment can occur by more specially trained individuals. I like how you mentioned how restructuring and rejuvenating the current hospital settings would be more conducive to treatment for all mentally ill patients. I agree that some overhaul is needed to make the environments more rehabilitative-friendly.   "
989,"Steve, I really appreciate your perspective and you offered an interesting alternative that I had not considered. I do think that for safety reasons, it may be beneficial to house individuals in different facilities based on their involvement or lack thereof with the criminal justice system. Would an alternative be to house them in different wards or are you thinking completely separate buildings? Would this just encompass separating those that are civilly committed versus those that have been criminally charged? Otherwise, I am just wondering how the separation would be determined. I think we can all agree that many of these individuals require treatment, the question is then, what kind of environment is best suited to meet their needs, and how can we make the treatment environments safe and conducive to rehabilitation. Definitely not an easy question to answer or an easy fix."
990,"No, the data sharing forms do not seem sufficient to understand the link between the CJ and MH systems. The data sharing is minimal to non-existent at best and in order to better understand the relation, more information is necessary. Knowing what treatment needs are present before, during and after CJ involvement is crucial to determine how best to meet the needs of these individuals. Linking these individuals up with appropriate, consistent services is also extremely beneficial. I do like the recommendation discussed in the video of an online resource. In addition, perhaps instituting liaisons at both agencies can facilitate cooperation and collaboration."
991,"The CIT approached used is different from a ""routine"" law enforcement encounter in that the officers calmly approached the situation, used reflective listening, and asked questions. They took their time to understand what was going on and made sure that the individual understood that they were there to help. They explained the process to him and did not escalate the situation."
992,"Unfortunately, court orders or legal actions may be the only way to fully hold people accountable. They feel more pressured to make the changes when there are legal repercussions behind their actions. It may also force changes from the top down which may be difficult to do without that added pressure."
993,"The challenges for the mental health workers are the general environment, the distrust the inmates likely have of authority, and as the one doctor mentioned, ""selling a way of life"" to the inmates that might be foreign to them. Jail and prison are not very therapeutic environments and the mental health workers have to start by building relationships with the inmates and getting them to buy into the treatment process. Cross-training would be beneficial so that each group understands the purpose of the other and can lend support. They can work together to create an environment where PWMI can be successful."
994,"Training that is essential for both mental health and criminal justice actors is training that encompasses the full breadth of information related to mental health issues. I think the training curriculum developed by NAMI as discussed in the Parker (2009) article should be utilized with all mental health and criminal justice personnel, including those involved in the courts, corrections and consumers. This training should be mandatory for all individuals working with PWMI. The training first gave participants information on major psychiatric diagnoses as well as the criteria necessary for diagnosis. The training then focused on the biology of mental illness which I think can help to alleviate some of the stigma that may be ingrained into opinions about PWMI. Acknowledging that mental health has biological components can help to understand that mental illness and the actions that accompany it are not by choice. Treatment of mental illness and the medications prescribed are also covered in the NAMI training. All of these facets can paint a bigger picture for those who are not previously educated on mental health issues and treatment. Finally, the training also details how to interact and work with PWMI. This is such an important aspect of the training in my opinion. Knowing how to address concerns, talk with someone who may be suffering from a mental health issue, and treating them with respect can go a long way to not only help those with mental illness but also to improving the safety of staff. Given that PWMI are more likely to be written up for breaking a rule or charged with assault (Parker, 2009), perhaps these incidents could be decreased or managed more effectively if personnel were better training to identify malicious intent versus mental illness. Being able to recognize and identify PWMI can impact diversion, referrals for services and treatment (Watson & Fulambarker, 2012). If training is provided at all levels - 911 operators, law enforcement and EMS response, court personnel, corrections officers, probation/parole officers, etc., I believe it can go a long way in helping to ensure the success of PWMI.  For individuals working direct care such as police, corrections or hospital staff, I think CIT training should be mandatory. Those were are trained in CIT are taught how to de-escalate situations, identify mental health-related issues and how to refer for appropriate services (Watson & Fulambarker, 2012). CIT training, in combi"
995,"Carolina, I too suggested that all personnel receive the NAMI training. I'm curious to know why you would choose to have it for ten weeks rather than five and what you would add that should be covered in those five additional weeks. I guess my thought process was that NAMI training should be provided to all individuals who work with PWMI. I think it is a training that can be completed at the initial hiring process as well as ongoing training. However, I do think it would be beneficial for direct care or front line staff to participate in a more comprehensive training such as CIT. Do you think it would be helpful to do both trainings? Curious to hear your thoughts. Thanks for your post!"
996,"Hi Denise, I agree with all of your suggestions for training measures. I'm curious if you think that either the CIT training or NAMI training from this week's readings would be beneficial? Much of what you discussed seemed as if it related specifically to CIT training such as de-escalation techniques, identifying symptoms and recommendations for treatment. I agree that police and correctional officers ,who are the front line workers, should receive the bulk of the training on how best to interact with and handle a person with mental illness. I also think it would be beneficial for EMS, court personnel and probation and parole to participate in some form of training such as the NAMI curriculum. Something not so rigorous, but where they can still receive an overview of mental health, its biological makeup, treatments and identification of symptoms. I think this will not only go a long way in improving interactions with PWMI, but also hopefully in diminishing some of the stigma associated with mental illness."
997,"There is likely a two-part component to why diversion efforts focus on non-violent offenders. Perhaps on one side, they believe that non-violent offenders are more likely to be rehabilitated. On the other hand, there may be a retribution that those who commit violent crimes need to serve their debt to society. Violent offenders are still in need of treatment, but perhaps not as an alternative to jail. It is then essential that they be initially screened and receive comprehensive and quality treatment. Additionally, as stated in previous lessons, correctional officers should have specialized training to deal with mentally ill individuals. I also think the idea expressed in this lesson regarding ""in reach"" services would be beneficial so that when they are released, they too will not cycle through the criminal justice system. "
998,"I think the hurdles are relatively the same. Both need the staff, training and resources to implement best-practice. Additionally, the costs associated with both agencies would be impacted. The major hurdle for both is also to determine what is effective and how well are the programs functioning that have already been established. "
999,"Integrated systems  would be extremely beneficial towards changing the way the justice system works for individuals with co-occurring disorders. Both mental health and substance abuse contribute to levels of incarceration. Integrated systems do not just focus on one versus the other. It provides treatment and recovery options for people with both disorders. If one is treated and not the other, one could assume that the likelihood of a person who cycles through the criminal justice systems would be higher. "
1000,"Peer mentoring can help reduce the stigma for PWMI in that they can assist the PWMI to understand their illness and  to know that they are not alone. We can all give advice, but sometimes it is difficult to provide sound advice when you have not actually been through the process yourself. Peer mentors provide a sounding board for PWMI and a mentor's own experience can help to shed some light on PWMI's current experiences."
1001," If the recommendations by the American College of Physicians were implemented, it would affect outcomes of mentally ill individual criminal justice system in a number of different ways. The recommendations proposed have the ability to strengthen treatment for PWMI and as a result, hopefully decrease their involvement in the criminal justice system due to untreated conditions.  Involvement -  If the financial barriers are alleviated as it suggests in the article, it could go a long way to ensuring that those suffering from mental illness receive the treatment they need. Mentally ill may be more apt to seek treatment when not held back by the financial constraints of therapy and medication. Broadening the coverage of Medicare would be extremely beneficial to treatment of PWMI. Additionally, if the goal is also to initiate programs that aim to reduce the stigma associated with mental illness and to enforce non-discrimination laws, it may open the door to PWMI being more open to seek and continue with treatment.  Identification  - As noted in the article, mental illness and substance abuse are often related to physical health impairments and concerns. A whole-person-focused solution may help to identify mental illness and substance abuse issues earlier if physicians are trained to see the physical and biological components of the illness earlier. As noted, primary care is often the de facto method of treatment for individuals with mental health issues. If issues are identified and treated earlier, it may reduce the likelihood of criminal justice involvement.  Treatment  - If it functions as proposed, the integrated models would allow for more continuity of care. It would allow for cross-training and communication between mental health and primary care providers, which would in turn, improve treatment for PWMI. If evidence-based practices are implemented, it again could only strengthen the treatment provided to PWMI. Again, if financial constraints are also decreased, PWMI may be more likely to seek treatment.  Outcomes -  If financial constraints and the stigma surroun"
1002,"Hi Bobbie, Great post. I appreciate your insight on screenings which is something I neglected to mention in my post. I agree that screening individuals in a primary care setting for mental health and substance related issues may help to identify needs earlier. Oftentimes, primary care is the only avenue explored as the stigma of mental illness prevents people from seeking specific mental health treatment. However, if identified and encouraged in a primary care setting, they may be more willing to seek the treatment they need. "
1003,"Hi Wendy, I really appreciated your perspective on the matter. Although I ultimately believe that integration would be helpful for PWMI, especially as it relates to early identification and treatment, I do understand where you are coming from. I found myself also having some reservations about the complexities involved in not only the cost of implementing the integration, but the ability of primary care physicians, who are in fact trained quite differently than mental health providers, being transitioned into the role. Ultimately, it will take a lot of time, training and funding to complete such an integration. Great post!"
1004,"Based on the video, there are a few things that could have been done to prevent the death of Timothy Sounders. First, Timothy Sounders needed psychiatric help. The video explained that there was no psychiatric professional because they had taken a seven week leave and was not replaced. Psychiatric intervention was noticeable after Timothy refused to drink the limited water he had and attempted two suicide while incarcerated. Second, the correctional officers need more training on how to deal with someone with mental health concerns. It stated in the video that Timothy was diagnosed with manic depression and was brought to jail on robbery charges. From the video it was clear that Timothy was not a violent individual and the only time he “fought back” was when he wanted officers to shoot him as a suicide attempt or to get out of the restraints after an 18-hour period. Training for the officers would have prevented the death of Timothy because they might not be aware of his mental health concern or the severity of it. They could have seen his behavior, such as flooding his room or refusing to drink water as manipulative. Rather than putting Timothy in restraints for flooding his room or putting him in solidary confinement for taking a shower without permission, they could have taken the time to counsel with him or put in mental health referrals of much needed psychiatric intervention. Unfortunately, the criminal justice system is largely in contact with people with mental health concerns. Due to this, having untrained and ill-equipped officers who are ultimately going to have to deal with these crises exacerbates the problem. Persons with mental health concerns remain in custody for longer period of times and have more contact with the system; therefore, the officers seeing them twenty-four hours a day should be trained so more deaths like Timothy Sounders can be avoided."
1005,"Hey Eva, Thanks for touching up on the paperwork! While watching the video I made a note about this but forget to mention in it my post. The paperwork never being completed and delaying a transfer for Timothy to a hospital is another issue that I believe could have intervened his death. Working in the system, it has shocked me how backed up and slow the process is of transferring or releasing someone. For example, we had one youth in custody that was waiting to be released to new foster parent, but the probation officer had forgotten to get the paperwork in on time and left for vacation. Therefore, the youth had to remain in custody for another month. There could be many factors of this, such as the probation officer, or in this case a social worker, having huge case loads due to the high volumes of people coming in and out of the system and they forget pieces of paperwork. When it comes to youth just wanted to go home or someone with a mental health concern being transferred to a facility that will be more helpful and beneficial to them it’s heartbreaking when tasks that seem so easy aren’t completed."
1006,"Some non-medical considerations that have driven the establishment of treatment and care for PWMI is by through the anti-psychiatry movement and civil rights movement. From the anti-psychiatry movement, Laing, Foucault, Szasz, Goffman, and Judge Bazelon were all involved with non-medical considerations for creating better treatment and care for PWMI. Laing believed that mental illness was due to social causes and therefore treatment would work through social remedies. Foucault believe mental illness was due to cultural constructs and economic influences and did not need treatment, just a new discourse. Goffman believe mental illness is worsened by the identify of mental illness and treatment and care is giving them back their pre-patient identities. Judge Bazelon believed treatment should be in a less restrictive environment, such as based in the community rather than a hospital with medical considerations. In the Civil Rights movement, non-medical considerations for treatment was based on rights. For example, in the  Wyatt v. Stickney (1972), treatment and care were based off a patients’ rights being violated due to employee shortages harming the quality of treatment being provided."
1007,"I do not believe that the benefits of a national registry of mental ill persons outweigh the costs in regard to gun violence. Research has demonstrated that persons with mental illness are not violet individuals and are often victims (Schanbacher, 2015). In fact, this week we learned that the estimate of violence caused by PWMI is only between 3-5%. This is not believed by the United States however mainly due to media coverage, gun availability and homicide rates. A study done by Argaones, Lopez-Muntanzer, Ceruelo and Basora (2014) found by looking at media articles in the United States that when the articles discussed the dangers of PWMI, 35% of the time it was towards a danger to themselves, 36% of the time linked with violent crimes an only 4% linked with them being a victim. Currently, there is no definite evidence that PWMI are physically different than those with a mental illness or that there is any evidence supported theory of PWMI relationship to crime causation (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013). This means that many individuals with a mental illness will have their rights restricted and be improperly defined as violent to fit a specific profile. This is problematic not only because it furthers the criminalization and stigmatization against those with a mental illness it also deters individuals from seeking and obtaining needed treatment. I also do not believe that the benefits outweigh the costs because it would be very similar to sex offenders’ registries of which we learn in a previous course can have its drawbacks. Sex offender registries have shown little evidence that it protects children in the communities (Travis & Reppucci, 2002) and it increases social shunning, creates possible violence and physical assault, and creates of loss of privacy and friends. As previously stated, PWMI are often not violent and therefore having these registries will have little protection against gun violence. Similar to a sex offender register, if we have a mental health national database; these individuals will be identified as such for the rest of their lives. This can be problematic not only due to refusal of treatment and further stigmatization but also because if there is a mistake of diagnosing or labeling someone as having a mental illness, they could many more consequences. Rather than punishing these individuals for having a mental illness and taking away rights for being “violent” due to a misconception, we should be look"
1008,"Crystal Dieleman had brought up a lot of important problems that need to be fixed for people with mental illness to get back on their feet such as legislation and policy barriers, poor resource system and services, misconceptions of those with mental health concerns, and the NIMBY (not in my back yard) phenomenon. Out of these problems however, I believe the most important problem to fix is through legislation and policy barriers. I believe this because I think policy and legislation have a deep intersection with poor services, misconceptions of those with mental illnesses and the NIMBY  mentality. For example, one the driving forces for deinstitutionalization was that it was fiscally beneficial for states because the government would be financing community-based treatments and because it was civil-liberties-oriented by releasing humans from essentially being punished/held in state hospitals. This support for establishing local facilities however decreased quickly due to NIMBY mentality based on fear and misconceptions and changes to politics, ordinances, and legal barriers (Slate, Buffington-Vollum & Johnson, 2013). This rhetoric of PWMI being violent offenders were spread when PWMI are not violent offenders and are often vulnerable victims. Without these local facilities many PWMI were left of the streets, became homeless and were arrested and incarcerated. With legislation and policy barriers removed, more money can be placed back into these local facilities and create better resource systems and services such as housing, structure, source of income/employment opportunities, treatment and care. This in return will rehabilitate those with mental illnesses which may help reduce local fear and misconceptions. Slate, R. N., Buffington-Vollum, J. K., & Johnson, W. W. (2013).  The criminalization of mental illness: Crisis and opportunity for the justice system. Carolina Academic Press."
1009,"Hey Nicolle, I think this is really important too! Having a safe and secure place to live takes care of a basic need that in my opinion, should be a right. Having a safe and secure place to live helps take away the problems of not getting enough sleep due to fears of becoming a victim or self-medicating to stay awake and/or cope with the hardships of living on the streets.  Thanks for bringing this up."
1010,"Throughout the centuries, mental illness has mostly been viewed in a negative light. Pre-civilization, mental illness was attributed to evil spirits that needed to be banished or put to death (Slate, Buffington-Vollum & Johnson, 2013). Ancient civilizations viewed mental illnesses as an imbalance of body fluids that could be cured with treatment; viewing mental illness as something that needed to be fixed. Since this, ancient civilizations did not view those with mental illness as full-fledge members of society because something was “wrong” with these individuals; however, they did believe people with mental illness should be cared for humanely (Slate et al., 2013). The Middle Ages were similar to pre-civilization that based mental illness off of evil spirts such as  dybbuk (Judaism’s evil spirit) or diablo (the devil) and would be tortured or put to death if they were unable to control their behavior or comply with church rules (Slate et al., 2013). During the Renaissance period, humanism emerged and institutions for those with mental illnesses began to form, however, these institutions were known as a place of suffering, confinement and torture (Slate et al., 2013). The age of enlightenment was the next period where people started to view those with mental illness as people. Marquis of Beccaria believed humans were rational and had free will regardless of their mental state; therefore, allowing those with mental illnesses being accountable for their crimes and could be punished. Phillipe Pinel believed that those with mental illnesses were rational and just needed treatments that were tailored to their own experiences. Pinel also believed that those with mental illness needed to be protected and have individual liberties (Slate et al., 2013). Considering that Pinel and Beccaria believed that those with mental illness were able to rationalize and could be punished/protected with rights make me believe they viewed these individuals as members of society. Despite this however, they still viewed those with mental illness as having problems and therefore may not have viewed these individuals as full-fledge members of society. Pre-civil war mental health was still viewed as an evil that should be banished and many state hospitals began to form resulting in cruel and unusual confinement (Slate et al., 2013). Through the 19th century and through the deinstitutionalization period mental illness continued to be viewed in a negative light"
1011,"Hey Jennifer, Great post! You were very clear and had strong points. I thought it was important how you tied together society’s willingness to accept those with mental illness as full-fledged members of society and the Not In My Back Yard mentality. The NIMBY phenomenon began because people did not want local facilities in their communities housing people with mental illnesses because of the viewpoint that previous centuries have held; that they are violent, unpredictable and dangerous (Slate et al., 2013). A full-fledge member of society is someone that I would assume people view as holding their own, having a job, contributing to the community and carry relationships with people. Due to people not wanting these local facilities being built for community-based treatment due to these misconceptions, I would assume they did not view those with mental illnesses as holding their own, capable of holding a job and contributing to their community. It is an unfortunate reality because those with mental health concerns are not dangerous and are often a family, friend, coworker or even oneself. For example, State et al., (2013) explained how one in four individuals in the United States has a diagnoseable mental illness over a span of a year with 6% having a serious mental illness. In regard to violence, we have learned that the estimate of violence caused by those with mental illness is only 3-5% whereas the rates of violence with the influence of drugs and alcohol is over 80% (Obodeze, 2019). This demonstrates that those with mental illness can and are full-fledge members of society and do not cause majority of the violence in our society. Similar to you, I believe a needed switch from this rhetoric is education and creating a more open and accepting environment of human beings. Obodeze, B. 2019. “Alcohol And Crime: Does The Popular Drug Influence Offence Levels?” AlcoRehab. Retrieved from  https://alcorehab.org/the-effects-of-alcohol/alcohol-related-crimes/"
1012,"Hey Danielle, I really enjoyed reading your post. I also am concerned by the NIMBY mentality. As Crystal Dieleman and Slate et al., (2013) expressed, the public has a very exaggerated perspective on those with mental health concerns and the relationship with violence. Dieleman also expressed what she believed that those with mental health concerns need in order to “recover”. It is important for those with mental illnesses to have a safe and secure place to live, meaningful activities to participate in daily, employment or a source of income, relationships with family, friends, and/or the community, resources, dignity and respect and agency. These are not things that are out of reach or that should be very difficult to obtain. Due to this NIMBY phenomenon, along with poor access to services and legislation/policy barriers, these important factors for those with mental illness are difficult to reach. With the NIMBY phenomenon, many state hospitals or treatment facilities are in remote locations far away from family members and friends. This puts a damper on social bonds and the relationships created which makes it harder for those with mental illnesses to get back on their feet and recover. I also agree with you that it is extremely important for people to talk about the issues that make them uncomfortable and why something or someone makes them afraid. They made have a misunderstanding, being misinformed (such as those with mental illeness being violent) or have previous trauma that could be relieved from such discussions. Thank you for your post!"
1013,"There are many ways that a president can effective in trying to bring an end to stigma of mental illness. One way this can be done is through media. As we saw in the video of Obama calling for an end to mental illness stigma, he brought up the discussion of the challenges of feeling isolated and that those with mental illness are human beings. The president has the platform to bring a conversation or topic to light such as debunking the misconceptions of those with mental health or the link between labels and negative stereotypes. For example, research has demonstrated that media representation of those with mental illness are often dangerous and violent (Slate Buffington-Vollum & Johnson, 2013). This becomes problematic because a survey by Caputo and Rouner (2011) showed how 70% of respondents got information about mental illness from news programs, 58% newspapers, 51% television shows and 34% magazines. In fact, research has also revealed that due to the media effect and misrepresentation of those with mental illness, people tend to have more of a negative belief towards people with mental illness and have a greater intolerance; limiting the want for services in their communities (Slate et al., 2013). Having a president that supports people with mental illness and gives accurate information through their platforms (such as most violent acts are committed by the general public and PWMI are 14 times more likely to be a victim than an offender (Slate et al., 2013)) can generate more positive attitudes and reduce segregation of persons with mental illness from society. Another way that a president can be effective in bringing an end to stigma is through the structural stigma. Structural stigma is brought by policies, rules, and procedures of institutions in power that limit the opportunities of those with mental illnesses (Slate et al., 2013). Examples of this would be for a president to pull in funding for the mental health system or to expand civil rights. In fact, in the last few years approximately $2.1 billion has been cut from mental health services and programs such as Medicad (Slate et al., 2013). Cutting funds results into services being privatized (limiting the required standards that institutions need to follow), shortage of staffing, or expensive medications. In regard to civil rights, Hemmens, Miller, Burton and Milner (2002) found those with mental illness throughout the United States have limited political and familial rights su"
1014,"I think the movement toward reducing more benefits for mental heath care says that the policymakers due not view mental health care as important compared to other health care. Wanting to reduce benefits, policymakers may view people with mental illnesses at being at fault for their illness due to making poor choices such as drug use or having poor moral character. As we learned this week, perceptions of people with mental illness to be at are more likely to respond to their needs with anger, denial of help and wanting harsher punishments. There is a clear need for mental health care resulting in patients waiting at emergency rooms for hours, days or even weeks to be seen or referred to specialized staff. Other medical care such as patients with cancer, obesity or the common cold have greater public concern and receive quicker and more adequate treatment. This is alarming because mental health care also trickles down to medical issues. In fact, those with mental illnesses are found to be dying 25 years younger than the general population without mental illnesses (Slate et al., 2013). The lack of mental health care is resulting into higher rates of obesity, disproportionate number of smoking and infection diseases and suicide (Slate et al., 2013). Unfortunately, policymakers reducing benefits for mental health care and making it harder for people with mental illness to seek out treatment shows that they are viewed and deemed as “less worthy” than other health care categories and policymakers may view them at being fault for their illness."
1015,"Veterans make up a huge proportion of the homeless population due to mental illness, substance abuse, medical issues, lack of services and social support and financial troubles (Slate et al., 2013). In fact, veterans make up 40% of the homeless population of males in the United States whereas the general population only make up 1% (Slate et al., 2013). This is problematic because homelessness exacerbates mental illness, substance abuse and medical issues with almost half of the veteran population suffering from some form of mental illness. Since this, 1 in 6 American service members are on at least one psychiatric drug; with 22% being diagnosed with PTSD and 17% diagnosed with depression (Slate et al., 2013). As we learned watching the US Army Infantryman (Chris) talk about PTSD and psychiatric drugs, he sees how easy it is to be diagnosed with a disorder and the effects of the medications given. Chris mentioned how he had taken a post-appointment survey that consisted of 30 multiple choice questions and was diagnosed with PTSD and recommended psychiatric drugs. The side effects mentioned of these drugs however were hallucinations, mania, psychosis, and suicidal and homicidal thoughts; drug effects that a veteran should not be further exposed too. Chris also had mentioned that a lot of people that join the military were also once addicted to drugs prior to joining the army and he believed that giving them a schedule three drug that has the side effects causes more harm than good. Unfortunately, given the service member’s experiences with medication for mental illness in the military, I would not recommend solely relying on medication to treat veterans or active military personal. The best ways mentioned that helped veterans reintegrate into society was joining groups and talking about their experiences with people who had gone through similar experiences and preparing mentally for what they may experience beforehand. This is significant because many veterans do not seek treatment or talking with groups because of the stigma revolved around mental illness and feeling isolated. For example, a study found that 17% of veteran respondents were experiencing some form of symptoms of mental illness but 60% admitted they would be unwilling to discuss symptoms to love ones or seek treatment (Slate et al., 2013). Not only are veterans not talking about their experiences or symptoms, those who do seek treatment are not getting adequate help. Despite a lot of vetera"
1016,"I would say that society should not be allowed to “step in” and mandate treatment. It may seem like a good idea to mandate treatment because anosognosia is a symptom of mental illness that results in a severe lack of awareness of a person’s mental illness which could result in them getting harmed. Anosognosia affects a significant proportion (40-90%) of people with serious mental illnesses (Slate et al., 2013). Mandating treatment for an individual that is not aware of their mental illness seems problematic however, violating civil rights and producing self-stigma. Being exposed to public and structural stigma of being labeled “mentally ill”, people with a mental illness begin to self-stigmatize themselves in feeling unworthy, hopeless and incapable of life goals (Slate et al., 2013). One that does view themselves as having a mental illness to being forced into treatment for one could result in distrust of institutions, co-occurring substance abuse habits or even heightened rates of suicide. It is also problematic to step in and mandate treatment for someone who does not know something is deemed “wrong” with them for civil right concerns. People with mental illnesses are greatly misrepresented due to fear and misunderstanding. Due to the public beliefs of people with mental illness as being violent; it would seem that mandated treatment would be used as a form of control/punishment rather than help/treatment. Discourse around mental illness throughout history also shifts from what is deemed as normal and what is deemed as not normal. For example, until 1973 the DSM included homosexuality as a mental illness. Even though treatment was forced prior to 1973, it would be viewed as a huge civil rights issue to step in a mandate treatment for those who are not heterosexual and do not believe they have a mental illness."
1017,"Despite whatever grade or age youth is, I believe there should be some form of education to reduce stigma and misrepresentations of those with mental illnesses. Rusch, Angermeyer, and Corrigan (2005) found that the most effective method of reducing stigma is through education and contact. Education that is needed to reduce stigmatizing conditions should be on the research found with mental illness such as the majority of PWMI will never commit a violent crime, are not perpetrators and often are victims, and are unemployed due to stigma and limited educational achievements from lack of services. A clear example of belief contradicting with research among the public found was that only 25% of people believe that individuals with mental illnesses can live a normal life and only 42% believe that a person with mental illness can be successful at work; however research has demonstrated that most people with mental illness may recover completely or improve from their symptoms with the right treatment and there is no difference in employee efficiency between those with mental illness and those without (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013). Even with this however, research has found that education is more effective for people who already have knowledge about or had contact with people with mental illnesses. Since this, adding contact to educational programs is important. Contact between students and persons with mental illnesses shows that both are equal and can have supportive interaction. This education and contact theory of reducing stigma was supported by an Austrian study that showed a positive change of students’ attitudes towards a person with mental health concerns when a PWMI was involved with the educational process in comparison to an educational process without contact. Education and contact can come through many different methods such as educational seminaries in schools, displays of arts and talks by people with mental illnesses and mental health providers that work with PWMI. I believe we should start educational programs and supportive contact with people with mental illnesses in elementary school to reduce stigma because programs are already being taught to youth at these ages. For example, D.A.R.E., even though it has been proven to not work, began to be required for middle schoolers in 2009 and elementary schoolers in 2013 (Nordrum, 2014). I believe it is also important to start education and contact programs for youth becaus"
1018,"Amber, Great post! You articulated your points very well and backed it up with research. Like yourself, I believe that it’s important to start educating youth, regardless of their age about mental illness and its symptoms. In regard to teaching youth about mental illness to reduce stigma from a place of fear and misunderstanding; a child can begin to conceptualize and rationally think for themselves between ages 7-11 (McLeod, 2018) meaning early intervention to reduce stigma could happen as soon as grade level two. In another perspective, it is also important to teach youth about mental illness to help reduce self-stigma and understanding about oneself if they themselves face symptoms of mental illness. Distressingly, 70% of young adults and children who experience mental health concerns have not had appropriate interventions (Mental Health Foundation, 2018) due to being unaware/uneducated. This is problematic because new research has found that depression affects one in every thirty-three children and one in eight adolescents (”Depression Often Starts in Childhood”, 2004). Children who are depressed may become isolated from friends and family and may not do well in school. You also brought up suicide, which is more common with PWMI than the general population (Slate et al., 2013). The rate of suicide is the sixth leading cause of death among children between ages of 5-14 and has almost tripled since the 1960s (”Depression Often Starts in Childhood”, 2004). Having a conversation about mental health is important for youth no matter how young because it could help reduce public, structural and self-stigma and it can also save lives.

1019,"Liisa, I like your idea about public education of children should focus on their own student body then expand to include the long-term effects of stigma. This is an interesting perspective that I hadn’t thought about. I feel like focusing on their own student body gathers the culture of that specific school since schools are drastically different between states, cities and even counties. Focusing on their own student body also helps create a sense of unity because the youth are more likely going to care about their classmates than outside strangers. As Rusch et al. (2005) discussed, participants with educational programs who have better knowledge about mental illness before tend to agree with the messages and become more empathic. Starting at a young age and focusing on their student body helps them relate to one another which can translate into reducing the stigma and creating more positive attitudes towards people with mental illness outside of their school and community. What do you think is a good way of educating youth about PWMI and how could we focus on their student body?"
1020,"For sensitivity and specificity in regard to civil commitment, sensitivity would be the proportion of people who have a mental health issue and are predicted to have a problem (danger to themselves or society). Specificity would be the proportion of people who do not have a mental health issue and are not predicted to have a problem. In a perfect world, sensitivity and specificity would be correct and all decisions regarding if one has a mental illness and are predicted to have a problem/one who does not have a mental illness are not predicted to have a problem would be accurate. If all people were identified correctly, there would be no mistake of incarcerating an innocent person or letting go a dangerous one. This would make civil commitment decision making simple because there would not be the fear of forcing treatment/medications onto an innocent person or allowing someone to commit dangerous acts against themselves or society. This is not the reality however, and there will be false positives and false negatives because mental health professionals cannot predict who may become a danger in the future because human behavior is changeable. Since this, it would be important for society to determine what is more important; incarcerating an innocent person or letting a potentially danger person go. Depending on what is deemed as more important, we could increase the chances of having more true positives or true negatives by making the requirements of civil commitment more specific or making the requirements more sensitive."
1021,"I have mixed feelings on involuntary commitment for violent sex offenders after they have completed their sentencing, but I feel like in the long run it is more problematic. For one, I think it is problematic because I believe it costs society more and can create more harm. For the individual being civilly committed, it can create a mistrust in the system which can further noncompliance of treatment. It can also influence those who may have not committed another crime to do so because of self and public stigmatization and/or making connections to those who are “dangerous”. It is problematic because being civilly committed requires a prediction of future behavior and sentencing is indeterminate. In fact, in California the average time of being civilly committed after sentencing is eight and a half years. Predictions of human behavior is also difficult because people change, and mental health professionals or judges cannot predict who may become a danger in the future correctly every time. Sometimes mental health professionals or judges may release someone who will commit future violent crimes, or they will civilly commit an individual who would have not gone and committed more violent crimes. Lastly, I think it is a bad idea because different states have different requirements for civil commitment and different definitions of what constitutes as a mental illness and what is deemed as “dangerous”. I think rather than civilly committing sexual offenders after they completed their sentencing; they should be required while in prison to attend treatment programs. For example, Huss (2014) showed a study found that treatment consisting of a 2-year cognitive-behavioral program and a 1-year aftercare program exhibited lower rates of sexual and general recidivism compared to those who did not receive treatment. Treatment programs that focus on the relationship between distorted thinking patterns (minimization and denial of victim harm), maladaptive behaviors, low self-esteem, inadequate interpersonal skills and social functioning are most successful and reducing recidivism likelihood and deviant sexual interests. Therefore, sex offenders will be more accepting of treatment and more likely to succeed on not committing future violent crimes. Matthew T. Huss (2014). Forensic psychology: Research, clinical practice, and applications 2nd edition. Wiley-Blackwell."
1022,"Unfortunately, both inpatient and outpatient commitment shows the state authority over one’s liberty because it is both coercive, anti-therapeutic, discriminatory and stigmatizing. Despite this, however, I think that inpatient commitment is a larger reach of state authority into ones’ liberty because individuals do not get a say of where they are able to stay and much more limited on what they can do to help elevate symptoms of their mental health. While both inpatient and outpatient commitment is viewed to be coercive because individuals do not get a say of whether they want treatment and medication, inpatient commitment is more infringing because individuals are placed into a locked down facility (incarceration before someone commits a criminal act) and they cannot do whatever they want outside of treatment, such as going to a specific place, eating specific foods or seeing family/friends (a possible major support system). When speaking with those incarcerated, such as the youth that I work with, majority would rather be released with some limitations of freedom (such as forced treatment and medication) than being locked up in a facility. Outpatient commitment is less authoritative on ones’ liberty because it allows individuals to live their “normal lives” in the community outside of required treatment consisting of only 3-5 times a week."
1023,"There are many pros and cons of inpatient and outpatient involuntary commitment. Unfortunately, the cons for both forms of treatment are that it is coercive, anti-therapeutic, discriminatory and stigmatizing. Coercion is problematic because it is said to infringe on individual’s rights by depriving them from any choice or control over their treatments which leads to anti-therapeutic; individuals not wanting to comply or continue with needed treatment. Inpatient and outpatient involuntary commitment is also stigmatizing because it contributes to the misconception that people with mental illness are dangerously violent and need to be committed to protect themselves and society. Lastly, they both are viewed to be discriminatory because blacks are more likely to be treated with coercion, placed in restraints and given emergency medication in inpatient commitments compared to other races and making up 35% of individuals placed with outpatient commitment orders in New York while only making up 17% of the state population in comparison to whites making up 61% of the population and only 33% of outpatient commitments (Swanson et al., 2009). Regarding inpatient involuntary commitment, it also imposes no limits on the duration of commitment with the average length in California being eight and a half years long. Regarding outpatient involuntary commitment, there is also a significant lack of resources (lack of services for those in rural communities and inadequate transportation), enough organization (no ability to enforce/track patients), and limited research on its success. Due to inpatient involuntary commitment rarely being used from fear of liability concerns, lack of funding and ignorance about law, the research on it is only from certain areas which could boost or devalue the true effectiveness (Slate et al., 2013). Despite these cons of inpatient and outpatient involuntary commitments, there is also many pros. The main pros of inpatient involuntary commitment is that it requires treatment which can help alleviate symptoms of mental illness and it helps protects the individual and society. Outpatient involuntary commitment also helps alleviate symptoms and protects the individual/society, but the available research has also demonstrated its successes. In fact, outpatient commitment has demonstrated an increase in medication compliance during and after treatment, increase of likelihood of engaging in treatment after outpatient commitment ends, a bett"
1024,"Cornise, Something you brought up that I did not speak about in my post was the “tragedy drives policy”. This con towards outpatient commitment is important because of how much we are seeing it in relevance today. As you mention, we see it through mass shooting and wanting to discuss mental illness and guns, or with increased deaths due to vaping and wanting to ban e-cigarettes. Slate et al. (2013) discusses how tragedy drives policy is problematic because the reforms are based of emotions and happen quickly; therefore, they may be ill-advised and counterproductive. Painfully, this happens with mental illness and gun violence; that the misconception is that majority of mass shooting happen to be people who are suffering from a serious mental illness. Due to this, the head spokesperson of the National Rifle Association, Wayne La Pierre, as we learned in week one, wants to create a mental health database for screening. This policy can be counterproductive considering that there is no evidence that mental illness accounts for the disproportionate amount of gun violence with an estimate of only 3-5% of violence being cause by people with mental illnesses. These policies are ill-advised because it can outcast an entire group. Also, similar to what Christie said, it would be interesting to hear more about the measures, such as medication adherence!"
1025,"Steve, Great post, readings yours I realized I took the question of measuring effectiveness of treatment in a different way. Since this I wanted to comment on yours. Measuring effectiveness of treatment presented by caseworkers is a brilliant idea because they are directly involved with the patient’s treatment and document effect it has had on them. Often, we see through articles that many measurements of parties directly involved with population in question is done so with interviewing. Do you think this is the best way to measure the effectiveness of treatment? If not, what else would you recommend? It would be interesting to see quantitative methods rather than qualitative methods but I wonder how that would interfere with patient confidentiality, especially since the patients are a part of a vulernable population to research."
1026,"Hello Dr. Turner,  I have not used Zoom before to record but I am quite familiar with PowerPoint."
1027,"I think that there are two criminal process that can be the most difficult for a person with mental illness, entering into the system stage and the adjudication stage. I believe these are the most difficult parts because of the different roles of law enforcement, a lot at stake of them either being arrested, convicted or released, and legal terminology being spoken about that PWMI, and majority of the general population, may not understand. A PWMI may have active symptoms that can interfere with their abilities to fully understand their rights in the interrogation room and at the adjudication phase. Symptoms that can interfere can be impulsive behavior, disorganized and delusional thoughts and/or feeling hopelessness which can make someone more susceptible to a false confession or becoming less assertive of their rights. For example, PWMI may have a difficult time providing explanations or have difficulty containing emotions when they are being questioned. Another example, a PWMI may not understand the different roles of law enforcement and may not understand that law enforcement is not there to protect them but rather to get a confession and that they have a right to an attorney and do not have to speak with law enforcement until an attorney arrives. This is important because PWMI making up 35% of false confessions (Norris & Redlich, 2011). A study conducted by Rogers, Harrison, Hazelwood and Sewell (2007) also examined PWMI understanding of their rights and found that Miranda warnings were often administered at or above sixth-grade levels and were only understood by 10% of offenders with mental illnesses. A PWMI may also not understand the true consequences of taking a plea deal making the adjudication stage most difficult. For example, adjudicative competence, which is a constitutional right, is having the ability to understand the legal process, making legal decisions that are in their best interest, knowing their rights, as well as assisting an attorney. If ones’ symptoms interfere with their ability to know their rights, best interests and ability to assist their attorney; they may take a plea deal and face dire consequences. The adjudication stage is can also be problematic because research has demonstrated that legal documents and forms often contain legal language written at grade levels that exceed majority of offenders’ capabilities (Redlich & Bonventre, 2015). In fact, the average reading level for legal forms for entering a"
1028,"One of the aspects of Prop 57 is that prisoners can earn credits in reducing their sentencing time for program participation. One of these programs can be for prisoners with mental health concerns to join a treatment program and earn credit for successfully completely a scheduled actives and structure treatments. This can help those incarcerated with mental illnesses to seek treatment as well as push PWMI to continue to obtain treatment once they are released. A benefit of Prop 47 is that it helps the state funding which can be spent on other services such as needed mental health and substance abuse services or funding more hospital beds/staffing. A potential challenge of these recent changes in policy however can also reduce the changes of PWMI to obtain treatment. For example, Prop 47 reduces non-violent drug and property offenses from felonies to misdemeanors. Since this, people with mental health concerns may not be incarcerated and therefore may not have access to receive treatment or resources similarly as before. A benefit of this however, is not incarcerating a PWMI for a low-level crime which creates significant implications for their future such as housing and job oppourinty loss and another stigmatizing label."
1029,"I can see how it can become problematic and unfair for police officers to serve as first responders to situations involving PWMI. Not only because it can create injury to police officers and PWMI but also because of the resources being provided to respond. For example, a study looking at the Durham Police Department in North Carolina demonstrated just how many resources were being produced for police to respond to PWMI (Slate et al., 2013). Prior to a mental health outreach program, the total amount of 911 calls in a year for four PWMI was 222. This number reduced after the mental health outreach program was implemented to only 4 911 calls a year. This demonstrates the high levels of police involvement with only FOUR people suffering from a mental illness which can have an effect on other 911 calls (such as time response or responses in general before others) and money (such as overtime or gas for county vehicles). On the other side of this however, I do not believe that it is “unfair” for police to often serve as first responders because it is a part of their job, they never know how serious symptoms/how unsafe a situation is, and they often show PWMI with empathy (Slate et al., 2013).   "
1030,"CIT and stigma are related because police officers without the training and experience may have misconceptions about PWMI similarity to the general public which creates stigmatization. Misconceptions that many believe are that PWMI are violent, unpredictable and incapable to be reasoned with. With CIT training, police officers can be taught that this is not the case with PWMI, and they are instead not violent and rather victims and that they can be reasoned with. These interactions and an informed officer treating a PWMI with empathy can also help with influence a PWMI internalized stigma. For example, a person who wants to commit suicide may have low self-worth and self-respect from stigma and the interaction of an officer can influence future outcomes. If an officer is empathic and not stigmatizing, the PWMI may remember their encounter and have more self-worth in the future to not commit suicide. Even better, the PWMI may remember the police officer and know they can turn to them if they need help. If the police officer is not CIT and has stigmatizing behavior, the PWMI may in the future commit suicide because of further diminished self-worth."
1031,"Even with the Taheri findings related to the effectiveness of CIT, I would still suggest a continue use of the model because it still provides important information such as signs and symptoms of mental illness, info on medications, de-escalation techniques that can be beneficial for PWMI and the lay public, and it also helps the interaction with mental health services. Police officers with or without CIT will still have a significant amount of interactions with PWMI, with 1 in 10 police calls involving someone in a mental health crisis and officers on average having six encounters a month with a PWMI in crisis (Slate et al., 2013). Having CIT integrated into normal police officer training will help police officers understand a population that they have to interact with which creates officer safety and a less stigmatizing environment. Also, the interactions between police and the mental health system is not positive because their goals are vastly different. Police officers feel that the process of bringing a PWMI to jail is a lot faster than bringing them to a mental health system whom may not even accept them (Slate et al., 2013). CIT training is important because currently, the average amount of training time dedicated to police interactions with PWMI is four hours and many agencies do not provide specialized training or policies on how to deal with crises (Slate et al., 2013). Like treatment services, some form of it is better than none. While Taheri’s findings did not demonstrate that CIT was effective, CIT does ensure officer safety, reduce law enforcement stigmatizing attitudes and is the best response out of the available responses for lowering arrest rates of PWMI (Slate et al., 2013). With this continued use however, I think it is important for future research regarding the effectiveness of CIT so it can either be quickly adopted by counties or slowly integrated into trainings. Similar to Taheri’s (2016) belief, future research should be based on random assignment of officers and not on a volunteer basis during the first stages of implementation CIT to see the true effectiveness. Taheri (2016) demonstrated that majority of the studies on CIT are based from officers who volunteered for CIT training. This is problematic because it can question its validity because officers who volunteer for it may be methodically different from those who do not volunteer such as already being skilled in counseling and de-escalation techniques with those in crisis."
1032,"Eva, Great post! You brought a lot of thought into areas that are important such as the reality of officer interactions. For example, you brought up how Memphis only allows specific police officers to participate in the training. Majority of CIT training in other jurisdictions are also only on a volunteer basis. At first, I would have thought this would be problematic because all officers encounter PWMI with on average of six encounters per month (Slate et al., 2013). With the high rates of interactions between PMWI and police officers; as well as half of all people shot/killed by police being PWMI (National Sherriff’s Associate, 2012), I thought this training should be required to all. However, the reality is in a crisis you would want an officer who has passion, patience, and empathy towards a PWMI to be interacting with them rather than someone who is not. Police officers are human beings and not all will have that same passion and patience towards a PWMI. For example, in Lecture 4.4 Officer Jamie Sipes, a crisis negotiator, spent two hours with a man who had just shot a police officer in the head. Not only are there heightened emotions because an officer was just killed, two hours is a lot of patience that some may not have. Having CIT training for specific people not only allows for the most equipped members of the police force to respond and de-escalate these crises, it also helps save resources, time and money. Another important issue that you brought up was that the incidents should be reported in a database, so officers are better aware of individuals who display a pattern of behavior with mental illness. Slate et al. (2013) discussed how some programs allow a PWMI to voluntarily register with an identification card and a bracelet that law enforcement would be able to recognize in case a mental health crisis occurs. While this can set up so that only law enforcement agencies have access to this database and have its benefits of saving time, resources and money, I have to disagree with it because I think this can become problematic. I think having any database of individuals with mental illness is problematic because it can further institution, public and self-stigmatization. Similar to our week 1 discussion and the head spokesperson of the National Rifle Association, Wayne La Pierre, wanting to create a mental health database for screening, the policy can be counterproductive further outcast an entire group. If we have a mental"
1033,"Stephanie, I really liked your suggestion that trained professionals should accompany police officers. We learned this week that CIT is the best of the three-specialized responses for lowering arrest rates but I think combining mental health professionals (mobile crisis team, a mental health-based special metal health response) and CIT officers (police-based specialized police responses) would enhance the effectiveness of interaction/outcome. Mobile team crisis can help accompany police officers because they can offer information about medications and symptoms about specific mental illnesses police officers may not know. These mental health professionals can also legally obtain the mental health history of the person in crisis which in turn can help reduce the time it takes to de-escalate the situation. CIT officers can help accompany the mobile team crisis by giving the added protection in the rare case that a PWMI becomes violent. Lastly, you mentioned in your post a few times that you would highly recommend continuing the use of CIT with your suggestions. Outside of a better interaction between police officers and PWMI, why do you recommend the continue use?"
1034,"I think it has to be very difficult for a person with mental illness to be arrested and jailed more than 100 times. People with mental illness already commonly feel unworthy, incapable and/or hopeless about pursuing life goals due to self-stigma. They are also often aware of the stereotypes portrayed on them by outsiders and since this internalize these stereotypes. Not only does self-stigma further exacerbate their active symptoms but not seeking treatment or self-medicating with drugs and alcohol, being arrested and going through jail also exacerbates their active symptoms making them feel worse. For example, the condition of confinement can push their coping mechanisms to new levels. Overcrowding, lack of privacy, boredom and being cut off them from their medications or self-medications are all conditions of confinement that affect coping which makes it harder and worse for persons with mental illnesses (Slate et al., 2013). If the arrestee also has an history of victimization and trauma, the jail experience is difficult when having to take showers and being searched by strangers. There is also the problem of isolation. A person with mental illnesses who have been arrested more than 100 times may be a difficult person to deal with. Since this, officers may give them isolation for a duration of time which has shown to have detrimental affects of one’s mental health. Each time they are arrested, even after the 100 th time, this must be extremely difficult because they are arrested when their symptoms are active and heightened; which may alter their coping mechanism, their ability to understand the process and why they are there."
1035,"The first indicator that jails should measure about mental illness is excessive repeat offenders. Looking at excessive repeat offenders can determine if there is a commonality between these individuals, such as diagnoses of excessive repeat offenders and what services could alleviate this, so they are no longer being locked up for 20-200 times. A second indicator costs of a standard stay of a person with mental illness receiving treatment. This could look at the cost and benefits of having the persons incarcerated and whether giving resources or paying for treatment outside rather than just giving them a bag of medicine with no plan would be more beneficial than locking them up. A third indicator is wait times of receiving medication. This is important because many persons with mental illnesses do not receive medication or do not receive medication for long periods of time while incarcerated. This indicator would be helpful to study because it would demonstrate the need of medication and could help explain why persons with mental illness are staying longer in jail (breaking rules and not copying well with environment).  "
1036,"I do not believe jail inmates are given too many rights because they are still human beings and at the end of their stay, we want them to be rehabilitated and not to be locked up again. Taking away rights and treating them less as human beings make it harder for rehabilitation. I think it is right for offenders to have a right to treatment and the right to refuse treatment. I also believe its right for offenders to have the right of freedom of religion, privacy to a degree, equal protection of law to expression and freedom of speech. As we learned throughout the videos, all these rights due have their limitations, but each must leave room for the offender to exercise their right.  For example, freedom of speech allows offenders to write letters even though they cannot email, or they can say what they want unless it questions the safety of officers and other offenders such as gang talk. Similarly, freedom of privacy is limited such as offenders must be strip searched however their phone calls to lawyers are not recorded. I think the one right that inmates do not have enough is in regard to treatment and that an adversarial hearing before a judge is not required to provide treatment against an offender’s will. I think in extreme cases when medication is required for the safety of others and themselves, medication can be forced…however, this should be required through an adversarial hearing before a judge with evidence of why this is appropriate."
1037,"It’s interesting that medication is the most common form of treatment for persons with mental illness in jail because of medication costs consuming a large portion of jail budgets, but also because medications are not effective for all individuals with mental illnesses leaving many individuals with mental illnesses untreated or only addressing certain symptoms, medications have many side effects that can be more harmful and deadly to others and the inmate themselves or non-compliance due to distrust of the system resulting in liability issues. A reason for why medication is the most common form of treatment because it is quick to administer and takes less time overall from mental health clinicians. For instance, passing out medication to 6-37% of persons with mental illness while incarcerated is a lot quicker than telepsychiatry or psychotherapeutic treatment which could result in 1-hour sessions between the 6-37% of persons with mental illnesses incarcerated.  Medications may also be easier than other treatment options because when treatment options do not work, things must change. If a medication does not work, new medication can be administered. When a specific counseling or psychiatric care does not work, it is much harder to make changes due to limited resources and staffing."
1038,"Jails are very inappropriate place for those with serious mental illnesses given funding, architectural and operational constraints. Regarding funding, there are many limitations to jail mental health services. Due to limited funding, staffing, materials (medications, screening and architectural), and physical space is limited for the treatment and success of those with mental illnesses. For example, in regard to staffing, there is not enough current mental health staffing to administer telepsychiatry or psychotherapeutic treatment to all inmates with mental illnesses (Slate et al., 2013). LA annuals getting 250,000 people booked into jails, which are estimated to have 6-27% being mental ill. All jails have mental health services, but only a handful of those that can give adequate needed treatment. Material is another limitation due to funding. Medications dispended to those with mental illnesses are not effective for all individuals resulting in some people not getting relief or only some symptoms getting relief. Medications are also from restrictive drug formularies; usually generic and the cheapest medications available (Slate et al., 2013). Since this, if an inmate is taking a medication out in the community and is not on the drug list, they are forced to wait for an approved medication or must try another. Both these issues with medication can lead to side effects to the person with mental illnesses which can cause more harm to themselves or others. Jails are so limited in regard to funding for treatment services that numerous studies have demonstrated that fewer than 50% of those incarcerated with mental illnesses in jail actually receive mental health services while incarcerated (Slate et al., 2013). Staffing, material and physical space is not the only aspect of treatment that is affected due to the limited funding. Limited funding also hinders treatment outside of the jail’s walls. For example, most discharged offenders with mental illnesses are repeat offenders because they did not receive adequate treatment while incarcerated and because they were not prepared once released (Slate et al., 2013). Discharge planning entails developing a plan for continuing services in the community once discharged to prevent individuals from becoming re-arrested (Slate et al., 2013). This requires however, inmates to receive treatment while incarcerated and requires more staffing and resources to establish and continue supervision of discharge planning"
1039,"Danielle,  Bedding is a part of architectural aspects that can affect incarcerated persons with mental illnesses that I didn't even think about! This is such a huge problem in our correctional facilities and I did not make note. In local prisons, there is about 630,000 individuals incarcerated with the majority not being convicted of any crimes (pre-trial). This is problematic when many of them may face mental disorders that they need treatment for. However, as you stated, there is only 1 psychiatric bed per every 3,000 people in the United States. Fewer than 50% of mentally ill jail inmates receive mental health services while in custody and the lack of beds for a psychiatric hospital can result in them waiting months to recieve treatment. Lack of beding can be an architectural factor, but it can also be a lack of funding and operational contraint (such as Title 15 rights in the require spacement between beds). I am interested in hearing what other thoughts you have in areas of how jails are inappropriate or appropriate for the seriously mentally ill given funding and operational constraits!"
1040,"Robert, You bring up some important points. First, you bring up how money is being invested into those incarcerated with mental illnesses and often are left with improper care that is not beneficial to them or society because of the likely chance or recidivating. I think this is important because not only do these individual often not receive treatment, the treatment they receive is medication; which we found is the most expensive form of treatment. Medication costs consumes a large portion of jail budgets, leaving many individuals with mental illnesses untreated or only addressing certain symptoms. Medications also have many side effects that can be more harmful and deadly to others and the inmate themselves. It seems since this, correctional policy makers are more worried about saving the money on treatment services because they do not see it as valuable. They may also want quicker services such as dispenses of medication rather than hour long treatments with a mental health clinician. Second, I like how you bring up the good and bad parts of the realignment policy.  Realignment was viewed as good thing last week because it kept offenders with nonserious crimes in jails for a shorter period of time. The bad part, however is that persons with mental illnesses may not be able to obtain treatment due to this because jails were the connection to the mental health system. Considering that half of incarcerated people with mental illnesses do not receive access to treatment however, I think this results into a bigger problem that we as a society, or people with mental illness, may be more willing to take that 50/50 percent shot of obtaining treatment or not. This is problematic because a 50% change of obtaining treatment in jail is a better chance outside in the community. This demonstrates how poor our mental health system is and how much more funding and resources on the outside is needed rather than on the inside of correctional facilities."
1041,"Risk assessments use predictions of the likelihood of future offending through looking at criminal history, mental illness, substance abuse problems, age of the offender and pro-criminal attitudes. As we have previously learned, psychologists and probation officers cannot make predications and risk assessment tools are then not often accurate. I think that using risk assessment tools when they are not 100% accurate can be problematic because they can result in biases or manipulations for economic, structural and racial ends. For example, low-income colored communities are disproportionately policed compared to white communities and those with mental illnesses are at heightened risk compared to those without mental illnesses because of significant amount of petty arrests and substance use. Simply being from a low-income colored community or having a mental disorder can increase the ""risk"" and future arrests of these individuals and give unequal opportunities of being released on supervised probation or increased arrests."
1042,"I think mental health professionals would be less inclined to use the RNR approach with PWMI because research has demonstrated that PWMI are not violent offenders and their crimes are often not associated with symptoms from their mental illness. For example, the study by Peterson et al. (2014) found that only 7.5% of crimes committed by PWMI were directly related to their mental illnesses and symptoms. Instead, crime motives were directly related to structural issues such as poverty, homelessness, unemployment. I think other factors besides recidivism that should be a concern for PWMI under supervision of the community is stigmatization and criminalization of the public and first responders due to the devastating consequences they both have."
1043,"Probation is better set up for the supervision and treatment of PWMI in comparison to jails when it comes to arrange counseling, job opportunities, education and coaching on making better life decisions because the PWMI is out in the community and faced with these hardships head-on; rather than facing them while being incapacitated. I think where it fails is that probation officers are limited by their caseloads of how often and how long they are able to see their clients. Probationers are required to see their probation officers directly at least once a month; but could happen more frequently or less frequently depending on their crimes and “risk factors” of not meeting probation requirements. In fact, 1 in 5 people will go back to prison for not meeting requirements of supervised probation. I think in comparison to jail, while resources such as treatment and supervision are inadequate, resources can be obtained more quickly and result in more compliance due to incarcerated PWMI not having any other influences of not attending treatment, such as substance abuse."
1044,"I also think probation is more cost effective in regard to treatment and supervision for PWMI because it costs $1500 statewide for one person on probation annually, while the costs of incarceration in house is just under $50,000 statewide. This means that money for PWMI and treatment can be distriputed more between needed resources; providing better care."
1045,"I would rather be a participant of mental health court than traditional court because it is more effective than traditional court, reduces the chances of recidivating, costs less to the community, and may have less long-term effects on life opportunities. For example, while both labels of being a criminal and having a mental illness are stigmatizing, I think for employment opportunities, housing and governmental benefits are more easily obtained if one is labeled as having attended a mental health court rather than a criminal traditional court. While all mental health courts are different, many courts will even dismiss charges against a participant once they have completed their requirements and treatment. This is significant since charges of felonies can have detrimental long-term effects on an individual’s life, such as the ability to vote or obtain benefits. I think the one area that traditional court processing can be viewed as better if I was a participant of mental health courts is that they mental health courts have more extensive probation requirements and I can be under the courts control from a longer period of time."
1046,"Risk-Need-Responsivity (RNR) is a model of correctional assessment and treatment, a tool used to assess risk of recidivism and treat a specific set of risks by assesses criminal history, antisocial behavior and patterns, pro-criminal attitudes, substance abuse problems, employment instability, family problems and low engagement in activities. RNR is becoming widely accepted because it focuses on having treatment tailored to the learning styles of the individual rather than in a group, generalized to adverse inmate population (Bewley and Morgan 2011). This is mainly due in part because RNR often provides Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) which has shown to achieve the largest and most consistent effects in reducing criminal recidivism (Skeem et al., 2015). RNR is also becoming widely accepted because of the promising effects of measuring risks and having a predictive validity of recidivism. In fact, Skeem et al. (2015) found that after release to the community, majority of participants in a CBT program continued in a similar CBT program outside of prison with only a 5% rate of returning to prison during the first year after release. This is significant in comparison to psychiatric treatment groups because they make up 33% of recidivism during the first year of release and CBT prison-only group make up 16% (Skeem et al., 2015). RNR model is becoming more used and accepted because it has promising effects and can reach both public safety and individual health goals for persons with mental illnesses involved in the criminal justice system. Skeem et al., (2015) notes caution for probation officers and the criminal justice system to use RNR because of the limited research, inability to accurately predict risk 100% of the time, and because Peterson et al. (2014) found that only 7.5% of crimes committed by PWMI were directed related to their mental illness or symptoms and often crimes were related to poverty, unemployment, homelessness and substance abuse; issues that the RNR model does not address. Since this, I would tell a Chief of Probation about supervision of a PWMI that they will have to expand beyond just treating psychiatric symptoms and criminogenic risk factors. Instead, it would be more beneficial go through extensive training on how to counsel and communicate with a PWMI to learn about their history and build that rapport. I would also tell them to help PWMI expand on their life opportunities such as housing, job opportunities and saving mon"
1047,"Clara, You mentioned an important recommendation to the Chief of Probation that not a lot of posts had made note of, including myself. We all emphasized on the need of probation officers mandating treatment, and how CBT treatment has shown to be most effective in reducing recidivism. While probation officers need to hold probationers with mental illnesses accountable for attending treatment, it is also important to hold them accountable for obtaining and taking needed medication. As Slate et al. (2013) demonstrated, a majority of prisoners with mental illnesses are released with no medication. This is in large due to being temporarily suspention or termination of medical benefits because there is no federal law requiring termination or upholding medical benefits during a time period after release (Slate et al., 2013). In fact, Baillargeon et al. (2010) found that majority of prisoners (60%) do not have health benefits/insurance 8 to 10 months after release from prison. Since this, it is really important for probation officers to know their probationers and help them get access to needed medications, as well as making sure they are continuously taking them. While this can result in critiques, such as coercion, many individuals with mental health concerns who were taking mediations while incarcerated want to continue use of their medication (Slate et al., 2013). Incarcerated persons with mental illnesses are released with limited supply of medication, some ranging for a few days to a month (Slate et al., 2013). If offenders are released on parole with only a week supply of medication but cannot receive medical insurance for 8 to 10 months, effects can hinder on their success of reentry to society and they are more likely to recidivate. Since this, it is good guidance to show probation officers the importance of treatment AND medication."
1048,"Danielle, Interesting perspective! I like how you tied in Maslow’s hierarchy of needs to this week’s material and what persons with mental illnesses need to be success in society. As you mention, Peterson et al., (2014) demonstrated how a very small portion of offenders with mental illnesses had committed their crimes due to their mental disorder and/or it’s symptoms. In fact, only 7.5% of crimes committed by PWMI were directly related to their symptoms; with 4% of crimes directly related to psychosis, 3% directly related to depression and 10% directly related to bipolar. When looking at what  is directly related crimes is poverty, unemployment, homelessness, and substance abuse. While substance abuse can be associated with mental health and as a form of self-medicating from symptoms, it’s important to look at the structural issues of why people commit crimes. As Maslow demonstrated, people need physiological needs, such as water, food, and clothing. People also need safety (employment, health, a home), love and belonging (friendships and a sense of community), esteem, (self-respect, status and freedom), and self-actualization (desire to become the most that one can be). These are all aspect that a person with mental illness may struggle to obtain due to stigmatization and criminalization. These are also all things that a probation officer can help a probationer achieve. While decisions are made by a probationer that can affect their success, probation officer do have a lot of influence on this and can help a probationer obtain these needs. What do you think is more important of allocating resources for a PWMI to reduce recividism, needs (as Maslow describes them) or treatment?"
1049,"Prison environment can be very aggravating to the condition of one’s mental illness. As discussed in week five, overcrowding, lack of privacy, boredom and being cut off them from their medications or self-medications are all conditions of confinement that affect coping which makes it harder and worse for persons with mental illnesses (Slate et al., 2013). The environment and having to follow rules where persons with mental illnesses may have difficulty doing also results in more disciplinary infractions. This can affect outcomes such as more time to sentencing or isolation from others, such as being put in segregation units. In fact, 62% of state prisoners with mental illnesses were formally charged with breaking prison rules compared to only 52% of state prisoners without a mental illness (Slate et al., 2013). In comparison to prisoners without mental illnesses, those with mental illness are also found to serve fifteen months longer in sentencing length (Slate et al., 2013). The prison environment can also be detrimental if the prisoner has an history of victimization and trauma, aggravating the condition of the person with mental illnesses such as having a difficult time when having to take showers and being searched by strangers. Without a history of victimization and trauma, those with mental illnesses are also found to experience more victimization in prison than those without a mental illness by other prisons and correctional staff. In fact, physical victimization was found to be twice as high and sexual victimization was found to be three times as high for inmates with mental illnesses as for those without (Slate et al., 2013). This in turn leads to higher suicide rates, self-injurious behavior, and more segregation, becoming full circle of aggravating a person with mental illnesses symptoms."
1050,"I believe that it is possible. While there are going to be people that can not be truly rehabilitated, I think if we gave the resources to help a person with mental illness successfully reenter society, they can be truly rehabilitated. Resources such as home and employment opportunities, similar accessibility to healthcare as those who had not been incarcerated and different treatment options. Such as treatment facilities that look at their mental health condition individually rather than categorically."
1051,"Working in a correctional facility, I can see the want for solitary confinement for maintaining prison order and getting the safety and security of the facility on lock. When someone creates a riot or a assaults another, such as killing another inmate or harming a correctional officer to a significant degree, it begs to question on where you can put this individual so they cannot harm anyone else. It also begs the question on how to punish them and for how long you can punish them for. Even with this however, I think the disadvantages for the inmate in regard to solitary confinement far outweighs the advantages of maintaining order, safety and security of the prison. For one, research has demonstrated that punishment severity does not decrease recidivism rates or committing crimes. Deterring crime through punishment has been shown through research to not work. This becomes even more problematic when it is inmates with mental illnesses. Inmates with mental illnesses face more infractions due to their mental illness and their symptoms. Since this, they are more likely to be placed in solitary confinement/segregation. This means that we are punishing someone for something they cannot control and therefore will not deter them from future infraction/prison rule breaking because we are worsening their mental health conditions by placing them alone with no stimulation and not going to the root of their problem, rather just locking the problem away. It is also problematic because it can create or exacerbate mental health concerns for inmates. As we learned previously, prisoners who face solitary confinement who did not have a mental illness can begin to have one and those with mental illnesses are often in much worse condition from when they were first put in solitary. A longitudinal study conducted by Andersen et al., (2000),  demonstrated that those in solitary confinement are at a significant higher risk of devolving a psychiatric disorder in comparison to those not in solitary confinement. These disorders include a mixture of anxiety, depressive, and psychosomatic symptoms. Most individuals placed in segregation (outside of those on death row) will be released back into the community. It seems in this sense that it would be more beneficial and more advantageous to place the individuals who threaten the security of the facility in shorter segregation time lengths and programs of why they acted out in the first place."
1052,"As the video explained, it costs $2,200 to provide treatment for a person with a serious mental illness in the community, while it costs $22,000 to provide treatment for a person with a serious mental illness annual while incarcerated. When looking at these figures, it seems that it would be more beneficial costly and effective to provide more evidence-based effective treatment in the community before a person with a serious mental illness is incarcerated. Despite this however, I think it is still important and needed to have tax dollars spent on treating the mentally ill in prison. These individuals will be released back into the community and it is not only more humane to give them adquate treatment while incarerated, it also can provide more safety to our communities. I feel that I would only be upset if our tax dollars were spent on treatment that was proven to not be effective. Since this, it is important to spend tax dollars on treatment options that work with reducing recidivism and helping allevate paitents symptoms, such as cognitive behavioral treatments."
1053,"Giving adequate and proper care to a PWMI while incarcerated not only enhances the order and functioning of the prison environment and reduce the chances of assault on others/staff, it also increases the chance of successful reentry to society and keeps communities safe. Since this, I think there are a lot of factors that need to be put in place that can meet the needs of inmates, staff, and contain costs. First, California alone spends between $1 and $2 billion a year with arresting, housing and treating mentally ill inmates (Slate et al., 2012) with costs of providing treatment alone nearly $22,000. A large portion of these costs, however, are due to medications. Relying solely on medications for treatment options for PWMI is problematic because sometimes they are not effective for all individuals resulting in some people not getting relief or only getting relief for some symptoms. As we learned previously, medications are also from restrictive drug formularies; usually generic and the cheapest medications available (Slate et al., 2013). Since this, if an inmate is taking a medication out in the community and is not on the drug list, they are forced to wait for an approved medication or must try another. Both these issues with medication can lead to side effects to the person with mental illnesses which can cause more harm to themselves or others. Currently, millions of dollars are been spent on building new and more prisons than spending on the treatment of those incarcerated with mental illnesses. Since this, it may be more beneficial to spend money outside of new and more facilities or medications, and rather spend it on evidence-based research that has been proven to be effective for alleviating symptoms and reducing recidivism rates, such as cognitive behavioral treatment (Slate et al., 2013). Along with spending money on evidence-based effective treatment rather than new correctional facilities and medication, training correctional staff and allocating resources to correctional health care is also important in maintaining the needs to keep inmates and staff safe. Allocating money towards correctional health care staff can help increase hire rates and help keep the already hired staff working. Understaffing is a major concern for correctional health care because it easy to be burned out due to the high case loads and limited resources. More staff can help with better screening and tracking techniques, correct diagnosis’s, proper medicatio"
1054,"  Denise, I really like that you brought up the idea of housing those incarcerated with mental health concerns in a separate unit rather than in general population or solitary confinement. This is important because not housing them in solitary confinement for not following prison house rules results in the idea that we are no longer punishing them for reactions from their mental illness. Housing them in the same unit away from the general population but not in solitary confinement also treats it more like a hospital rather than a prison. This idea can help bring back state hospitals but in a smaller context. Considering that PWMI are more likely to physical and sexually victimized by other inmates, I think it important for their safety to house them differently. Housing inmates with mental health concerns can also be beneficial because it can help keep order of who is receiving treatment and medications and who is not. One problem that I can see with housing those with mental health concerns in a separate unit is a clear indication of who has a mental illness and who does not; possibly creating further stigmatization. I think it can also be problematic because of the costs of building more units to house the individuals away from general population. As a state, we are already spending millions of dollars in building new correctional facilities, would separating PWMI away from general population result in containing costs or would it result in increasing costs?"
1055,"Steve, Great point on saving costs through cognitive-behavioral treatment. As we learned in previous weeks, cognitive-behavioral treatment has been shown through evidence-based research that it is effective for reducing recidivism. In regard to behavioral treatments, most correctional facilities use cognitive behavioral therapy treatment, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) which has also been proven to be promising and risk/need/responsivity (RNR) (Bewley and Morgan 2011; Slate et al., 2013). CBT and ACT have been shown to be promising and effective because it attempts to change an inmate’s unhealthy behavior and thoughts through cognitive reformation. CBT and ACT help offenders with their mental health concerns by recognizing the thoughts that are causing distress and teaches them techniques to alter these criminalistic behaviors and choosing a “healthy” valued life direction. The treatments are shown to be effective because they are tailored to the learning styles of the individual rather than in a group/generalized to adverse inmate population. I think that creating these programs in correctional facilities and getting adequate staffing is costly, but in the end would safe more money than relaying on the resources for inmates with mental health concerns. How do you think California could start implementing these programs in correctional facilities? Should it go through legislation, grant funding, or evidence-based research proposed to the Corrections Board?"
1056,"I would say that the construction of the new Fulton State Hospital is needed considering that it was first built in 1851. As the video explained, the construction of the Fulton was to maintain and house PWMI, not for treatment and providing a supportive environment. State hospitals are needed because they house PWMI that should not be criminally charged and have no where else to go. They provide care and accept more severe cases that community facilities will not. State hospitals can also provide more accurate diagnoses, medications delivered more effectively in controlled setting and the environment is more therapeutic than jails or disturbing home situations. The one thing that I would question about the construction of the new Fulton State Hospital with my tax money is that the mayor stated the new facility would in charge of discovering/administrating newer and effective treatment options for PWMI. I would want to know more about this and what treatment options they want to provide; such as if it is evidence-based treatment."
1057,"I would not describe NGRI as a “get out of jail free” card because the person found NGRI is still sent to a secured facility for a period equal to the maximin sentence of their most serious offense. In a sense, it could be considered worse because the person found NGRI did not realize what he was doing and why it was a crime due to their mental illness. Since this, being in a locked-up facility for them may be worse than a person not NGRI because they do not understand why they are there."
1058,"While state hospitals are not a prison and need to have an environment that promotes support and therapeutic services, I think it’s important for it to be similarly run with security and safety considering that 90% of patients are there forensically. Patients cannot receive affective treatment if a facility is not running safely. Flagship for example, has had many assaults on staff and other patients. In part this is due to understaffing and improper training. Unqualified staff are being pulled from housekeeping or kitchen aid when there is no other trained staff available. This results in assaults and patients overdosing on medication, being sexually abused and successfully committing suicide due to improper monitoring. Since this, I think state hospitals need to have more security and proper training on how to interact with aggressive behavior similar to the training that correctional officers receive. 96 assaults with injuries required medical attention in the last three years had occurred at Flagship, while only 3 injuries due to assault required medical attention at the juvenile hall facility that I work at within the last three years."
1059,"It is intimidating to think of a doctor using deep brain stimulation and open brain surgery as treatment for depression because it can result in brain damage, infection and death. However, I think it can be amazing and used when other conventional treatments do not work. While medications do not require surgery, medications alter the brain and can also result in severe side effects such as death. I think when all other conventional treatments do not work this could be a promising alternative. Deep brain stimulation has been used for 15+ years for Parkinson’s disease and has been shown to significantly make 2/3 rd of the doctor’s patients better for severe depression. Since this, I think it is important to continue to do research and its affects/risk factors but make it a possibility for those who suffer greatly from a mental disorder. This is something that I would like to learn more about and will be researching in the future."
1060,"I think the most appropriate role for state hospitals in relation to the criminal justice system is safety, especially since state hospitals are used almost exclusively for forensic patients. This week, we learned about Flagship State Hospital and how unsafe their procedures are. In fact, in the previous three years there had been 96 assaults with injuries that required medical attention. There had also been many other safety issues such as patients overdosing, successfully committing suicide, and being sexually abused. Staff and patients were being hurt due to the unsafe measures in place at the hospitals. These measures included unqualified staff being pulled from housekeeping or kitchen aids when no other trained staff were available to monitor the patients. This was shocking to learn because I work in a juvenile correctional facility and in the past three years, we have had only 3 assaults with injuries that required medical attention and we have had no overdoses, successful suicide attempts or sexual abuse. State hospitals need more security and proper training on how to manage aggressive behavior because majority of the patients in state hospitals are forensic. In fact, 90% of state hospitals are made of up forensic patients with only 10% of civilly committed patients. State hospitals are also more likely to admit patients who general hospitals are reluctant to admit (such as those who pose a serious risk of violence) and absorb a broader range of patients making it possibly harder to monitor (Fisher et al., 2009). While more than 75% of California State Hospital patients commit no acts of violence; those who are aggressive and assaultive (less than 200 patients) are responsible for more than 35% of all aggressive acts in the hospitals (DHS, 2018). Although state hospitals are not a prison and need to have an environment that promotes support and therapeutic services, I think it’s important for it to be similarly ran like a jail/prison regarding security and safety because 96 assaults in three years or 200 patients making up 35% of all aggressive acts in hospitals is still a significant amount of violence that can hinder the success of the programs goals/treatment. Department of California State Hospitals require a meeting four times a year to review hospital safety plans with updates on training and guidelines (DHS, 2018), however, violence throughout hospitals are still an increasing matter with the five California state hospitals on ave"
1061,"Denise, Similar to yourself, I also believe that a medical role is an important role for state hospitals compared to the criminal justice system. As you mention, state hospitals should be about treatment and less punitive. 20% of those in state hospitals are found NGRI (meaning that they are not criminal responsibly of their crimes due to their mental illness because they do not realize what they were doing and/or why it was a crime), 14% of sexually violent predators (sex offenders released from prison and civilly committed due to their sentence time ending) and 17% of Coleman cases (those incarcerated and determined to be mentally ill and needed inpatient care). This means that a majority of those in state hospitals may not know of their mental illness and the symptoms that affect their behaviors/actions and those who have already done their sentence related to their crimes but are not allowed back into the community. This highlights the importance of the originality of state hospitals, that they need to be about treatment and a supportive environment rather than further punishment for having a mental disorder. As we have learned, persons with mental illness are often introduced to the criminal justice system because of their untreated symptoms and due to lengthy process of the mental health system. Correctional facilities can exacerbate the symptoms of the mentally ill which highlights the importance of state hospitals. State hospitals in turn provide a quiet and supportive environment, accept more severe cases than community facilities giving accessibility to treatment to a range of people, allow families to be more involved with treatments, and removes patients from disturbing situations (such as prison or violent homes). One thing you mention is that state hospitals should be almost exclusively for forensic patients. Where should we put those who are not forensic patients, such as the 10% of civilly commitment patients who are a danger to themselves/others?"
1062,"Gabriela, I like your idea that there should be certain state hospitals that are better designed, trained and prepared to work with the forensic patients. This not only can help with the needed treatment for these patients, but it also can help keep them and staff safe. We could house different patients in different hospitals depending on their commitment terms, such as mental disorder offenders, incompetent to stand trial patients, not guilty by reason of insanity, sexually violent predators and Coleman case patients. Fisher et al., (2009) explained how recently between 1990 and 2000, 17% of the remaining 263 hospitals closed but are still standing, meaning this should not be costly due to not having to rebuild an entire facility. However, do you think housing patients to certain state hospitals and staffing more people would be more costly in the long run, since state hospitals are lack in funding? Or do you think this would be more beneficial/cost saving in the long run because treatment can be more individualized and patients/staff will be safer?"
1063,"I think that both systems having strict rules and regulations makes the two systems difficult to interact. Clinical staff have legal and moral obligations to not share information, especially without consent or it can ruin the relationships between the client and personnel. The client may even not have trust in the mental health system in general and will no longer want to seek out treatment, even with different personnel. These limitations may also hold back important information about a client that one system may have benefited from knowing, such as name changes and only authorized figures from viewing information. Sharing information is at a minimum to address the clients needs. Since this, the forms of data sharing are satisfactory but can have limitations because some information that is viewed as unimportant can be important in a different scenario. I think a way to improve these forms of data sharing would be to release all information (with consent) except information that can jeopardize a person’s rights in a criminal proceeding."
1064,"CIT trained approach appears to take a lot of time, patience and calm demeanor than a routine law enforcement encounter. When watching routine law enforcement encounters, such as in Live PD, officers usually seem rushed and have an aggressive tone. The officers in this video had a calm demeanor when asking questions and speaking with the client. They also did not rush him, such as interrupting him while he was speaking. One thing that I did not like about the CIT trained approach was the communication between the officers and the client. The officers asked the client questions but did not really seem to be listening to what he was saying. They did not paraphrase or ask him to clear up what he was saying, instead, they assumed how he was feeling and resulted into quickly taking him to the hospital."
1065,"I do not think that many people do things with bad intentions. I think it may take a court order or other legal action for departments of corrections to change the way PWMI are treated because the people involved did not realize how badly these people were being treated. They may have become desensitized to what they were seeing, or they may be just been misinformed. They needed to be educated on these individuals having a mental illness and that the behavior was a reaction from their mental illness that could not be mentally/physical changed on their own. Another reason why it may take a court order or other legal actions for departments of corrections to change the way PWMI are treated because of the chain of command. Those who are in higher positions have been in the facility for a long time with the same ideas of how to treat detainees. With new correctional staff coming in with new ideas and how to properly treat a PWMI, unfortunately, they may not want to step above their supervisors or dismiss an order based on improper/old techniques on dealing with a PWMI until it is written through a court order or legal actions."
1066,"Mental health workers have to deal with a lot of challenges in a correctional environment. For one they have to understand a lot of policy and procedures, such as jail classifications, behavioral health services available and their limits, release planning, community correction procedures, and the effects and obstacles PWMI will face due to be incarcerated. They also have to deal with safety precautions and what they can bring in as a form of therapy. For example, mental health workers need to keep note of items that can be used as contraband for weapons or a suicide attempt. Workers have to be aware to not bring in any staples, pens, paper clips and other items for relieving stress such as stress balls or a cloth piece because it could result in conflict between other inmates who do not have these items. Once, there was a kid in our facility who had a stress ball and would eat them as a form of coping with his trauma. This can become problematic because it is not easily digestible, and it could result into a chocking hazard; something that one does not want to happen when they are in their room/cell alone. Mental health workers in a correctional environment need to take extra safety precautions and think outside of the box of what they can do for their clients that they wouldn’t have to worry about if they were outside in the community."
1067,"I think for mental health actors, essential training to help benefit incarcerated PWMI is to learn policy and procedures of the correctional facility to understand the roles of the officers and what can and cannot be allowed. Mental health actors should also learn behavioral health services available while the PWMI is incarcerated and their limitations. Mental health actors should also learn release planning and community correction procedures, making sure their clients have achieved success once released and continue needed treatment and medications. Lastly, mental health actors should also learn the safety precautions and what they can bring in as a form of therapy. As I stated in my previous discussion post, mental health actors need to keep note of items that can be used as contraband for weapons or a suicide attempt. Workers have to be aware to not bring in any staples, pens, paper clips and other items for relieving stress such as stress balls or a cloth piece because it could result in conflict between other inmates who do not have these items. Once, there was a kid in our facility who had a stress ball and would eat them as a form of coping with his trauma. This can become problematic because it is not easily digestible, and it could result into a choking hazard; something that one does not want to happen when they are in their room/cell alone. Mental health workers in a correctional environment need to take extra safety precautions and think outside of the box of what they can do for their clients that they wouldn’t have to worry about if they were outside in the community. Law enforcement is another actor in the criminal justice field that needs training to benefit PWMI. Law enforcement needs training to understand mental illness such as what it is, common medications and their side affects and how negative attitudes can have consequences for PWMI. Law enforcement also needs training on police responses to calls for services and what they can do for PWMI; should they book them into a jail, bring them to a hospital or call a mental health service provider such as Crisis Mobile or community-based resources. Trainings should also include how to effectively communicate with a PWMI in crisis to maintain safety of the public, officers, and PWMI. Training for court personnel such as judges, prosecutors and district attorneys is also important because it can demonstrate how mental illness can be a contributing factor of a specific crim"
1068,"Briana, Great post! You mentioned how you noticed how officers are often putting PWMI on 5150 holds. I wonder how often this happens, in comparison to officers placing them in jail for a night, involuntary emergency evaluations and/or calling for community-based resources such as Mobile Crisis Teams or Crisis Intervention Teams to divert from being booked into a facility. I also wonder since more officers are getting CIT trained, how much more often this is in comparison to previous years before implementation of training. I looked up California involuntary detentions and 5150 holds to see the rates in comparison to arrest rates. I found it interesting that I cannot find arrest rates for the 2015-2016 fiscal year but did find 5150 hold rates. In my county, Humboldt only had 490 5150 holds in the 2015-2016 fiscal year in comparison to 57,564 5150 holds in Los Angeles. Considering this number in Humboldt, I think that police officers are more often putting PWMI in jails rather than 5150 holds. Even with officers getting trained with CIT, I am relucatant to think they are placing them more on 5150 holds. Where have you noticed this, because I cannot seem to find it?"
1069,"  Stephanie, Great post! I also agree with you that CIT training can be an effective tool in helping PWMI, but it needs to be longer than 40 hours. It was shocking to learn that law enforcement officers receive at least 8 hours and up to 15 hours of training in regard to PWMI. This is shocking because police officers are first responders to crises and 8 hours of training is not long enough to respond accordingly. Officers are more likely to not remember the training they received in 8 hours and more likely to respond from learned behavior/actions from experience on the job. This can result in poor outcomes such as affecting the safety of the PWMI, the public or the officer. The one problem with training that I can see with CIT is I feel like no matter the timeframe, there are still going to be limitations. For example, I had just gone through a 160-hour training which involved CIT techniques. However, I still do not feel that I am prepared enough and can respond to a crisis adequality to deescalate a situation without the help of others. Therefore, I wonder if time is irrelevant to the outcome of training and rather the content of the training matters and how it is taught (through PowerPoints, stimulation, or group acting). What do you think matters more of the effectiveness of training, the content, or the time/revisiting over a period of time?"
1070,"I think that diversion efforts focus on non-violent offenders because of the fear of safety and security. Those placed through hospitalization rather than incarceration will face less security protocols and the officers may be less trained on how to deal with aggressive behavior.  As we have previously learned, those with mental illnesses also often do not commit violent crimes. Diversion programs often accommodate towards those with mental illnesses giving them a outlet rather than incarceration, so therefore violent offenders may not meet this standard. Non-violent offenders may also be viewed to have a better chance at getting out of the cycle between the criminal justice system and community services that those with violent offences. Diversion programs, such as those in Fairfax, look to prevent involvement in the justice system, decrease admissions of incarceration of those with mental illness, engage those in treatment right away, link to community treatments, decrease returns in jails/prisons and minimize the time spend involved in the criminal justice system. Those with violent offences challenges these goals of diversion programs because treatment needed may be more concentrated, community treatments may not take them in due to qualification/standards and violent offenders spend a longer time involved in the criminal justice system due to the severity of their crimes. Controversy, I think violent offenders should have the opportunity to go to diversion programs. As the video stated, there are currently 356,000 PWMI incarcerated and 850,000 PWMI on probation/parole. Individuals on probation are responsible for a significant share of all violent crimes, with probationers responsible for 30% of all homicides (OJJDP,  2017). Interception five through the Sequential Intercept Model is community corrections and support systems for PWMI. Intercept five establishes better therapeutic alliance between supervision officers and their clients through the use of Mental Health Courts, specialized caseloads and mental health training for parole and probation offices. Since this, I think it would be doable and more cost-saving in the long run if there was another diversion program introduced for violent-offenders (separated from a diversion program for non-violent offenders). This would give similar opportunities to all offenders with mental illnesses for violent and non-violent crimes to get out of the cycle of returning to the criminal justice system"
1071,"I would assume that the hurdles are the same for the criminal justice and mental health agencies to implement evidence-based practices. They both have similar barriers such as having different administrative and regulatory structures making all facilities implanting evidence-based practices (Crowley & Kirschner, 2015). Example of this would be that mental health agencies face difficulties with differences among creditable and licensing requirements of clinicians which can affect the overall implementation of evidence-based treatments and criminal justice system have difficulties with differences in policy and procedures among different facilities. Both institutions may also have hurdles of implementing evidence-based practices because they are faced with an ingrained bureaucratic culture that typically maintains the status quo (Crowley & Kirschner, 2015). This can be seen with the challenges of newer employees versus older/almost retired out employees and wanting to change policies with support of evidence-based practices. They also face similar hurdles of stigmatization (Crowley & Kirschner, 2015). There is a persistent amount of stigma around care for mental illness and for those incarcerated. Since this, individuals may be more reluctant on implementing and/or testing evidence-based practices. Lastly, they also face the same problem of being state or county funded resulting in budget costs (for effective treatments, adequate staffing levels, safety and security of detainees/patients). All these hurdles can be overcame between both facilities; however, it can take a significantly long time and evidence-based practices may have to be implemented through law. For example, evidence-based research demonstrated the detrimental effects of room confinement; resulting into law that prisoners cannot be locked up in their room for 23 hours a day unless for severe security reasons according to Title 15. Time is the one difference that I can see between both facilities that I believe the criminal justice system can overcome easier. Considering that there is 356,000 PWMI incarcerated and only 35,000 PWMI in state hospitals; evidence-based practices are more likely to be implemented faster in the criminal justice system through law than hospitals because more people are affected (can result into a higher volume lawsuit for the Supreme Court to rule on)."
1072,"I think it would benefit the way that the justice system works with individuals with co-occurring disorders. The model focused on improving three areas of implementing the use of standardized screening, integrated services (treatment for mental illnesses and substance abuse) and using data to make informed decisions on areas of improvement and effective ways that treatment needs to go. The first and most important factor that the model in the video described was using standardized screening. Most treatment facilities use some form of screening that is often free and in the public domain, but it is often not standardized. This can result into many people being misdiagnosed or not diagnosed at all when they should be; therefore, not receiving needed and/or appropriate treatment. Considering that many prisoners have mental health issues as well as substance abuse; it would be beneficial for the justice system to using standardized screening for both substance abuse disorder and other mental health concerns allowing for early identification for early intervention. This can help break down the cycle of entering the justice system or having several returns/hospitalizations once released. Having integrated services is also important for the justice system because it could help change the overall environment; making treatment more assessible and comfortable. As we have learned, PWMI are often made worse while incarcerated due the environment of jail/prisons. Having a justice system with integrated services can help break down this environment and making PWMI more comfortable to seek effective treatment.  Lastly, using data to make informed decisions on areas of improvement can make a huge change in the way the justice system works because it would implement evidence-based practices that is effective in reducing the rearrests rates, minimizing time spent involving in the system or prevent initial involvement between the system."
1073,"I think peer mentoring is can be really helpful in addressing stigma of mental illness. Stigmatization limits access to opportunities and resources, limits interpersonal connections and can result in less than full participation in society. As the video stated, individuals with mental illness are able to talk to someone about their problems who have gone through similar challenges. This not only allowed for both individuals to not feel alone, it allowed for sympathizing, understanding their mental illnesses and getting out into the community. It also made room for individuals to help identify periods of distress and know which mechanisms one used to help cope with this distress. Knowing that one is not alone with their mental illness makes them feel less outcasted and which in turn makes them more likely to seek treatment. Allowing for sympathizing also makes one feel more human and understood. Overall, peer mentors can be helpful in improving well-being of those suffering with a mental illness because it challenges the results of stigmatization by giving access to opportunities and resources (a mentor has knowledge of available resources and what worked for them), builds interpersonal connections and results in more participation in society."
1074,"I think full implementation of the recommendations of the position paper would help involvement, identification, treatment, and better outcomes of the PWMI in the criminal justice system because it gives those who have discontinued care or unable to receive care due to offenses behavioral health care (Crowley & Kirschner, 2015). Evidence-based research demonstrates that integrating behavioral health and primary care leads to improved mental health outcomes, physical health, improved quality of life and lower overall costs (Crowley & Kirschner, 2015). Integrating behavioral health care with primary health care also can help involvement, identification, treatment and outcomes of PWMI in the criminal justice system because it can help prevent repeated cycling between the criminal justice system and community services. Early intervention through giving access to treatment can prevent initial involvement with the justice system and help engage those who need treatment as soon as possible with helpful resources. Evidence-based research demonstrates also that early intervention overall decreases admissions to jails for PWMI (Slate et al., 2013). Integration between the two systems can also help minimize the time spent moving through the criminal justice system and decrease rates of return due to linking PWMI with community treatments that they may have not been aware of or able to afford before.  The first recommendation of integration of behavioral health care into primary care encourages individuals to address their issues. The second recommendation is removing barriers that may impede behavioral health and primary care integration and giving adequate financial resources. Removing these barriers would be through stakeholders such as health insurance payers, policymakers and primary care and behavioral health care professionals. This would make it so all stakeholders have better communication and organization giving the opportunity for better treatment based off evidence-based research (Crowley & Kirschner, 2015). Research has also shown that through an integrated care model it helps reduce mental health stigma between all stakeholders (Crowley & Kirschner, 2015). This is in part with the sixth recommendation of initiation programs to reduce stigma associated with mental health and their negative perceptions. For example, evidence shows that mental health professionals tend to be more pessimistic on treatment outcomes for specific diso"
1075,"Asia, Awesome post, you really captured and concisely explained the recommendations and how they could benefit PWMI in the criminal justice system. One aspect you mentioned that I really agreed with was that integration can help PWMI the chance to seek treatment in a hospital setting and get needed treatment. As you mentioned, PWMI are often reincarcerated multiple times, up to 100 times or more due to the inability to receive adequate treatment. Through integration of primary care and behavioral health care, it can reduce the chances of gaps of coverage or inability to receive treatment which can reduce the chances of PWMI to be incarcerated and prevent them from repeated cycling between the criminal justice system and community services.  "
1076,"Steve, Really insightful post, I enjoyed reading your thoughts. One of the most powerful points you brought up with the benefits for PWMI in the criminal justice system through integrating primary care and behavioral health care is the opportunity of more standardized and effective screening. As you mention, screening can occur more often and can be done through evidence-based standards which increases the chances of identifying mental health concerns and identifying them correctly. This can in turn lead to treatment opportunities and effective outcomes for PWMI. Having screening more often could be during an original assessment, during incarceration and after incarceration which can increase the chances of giving correct treatment and equip individuals with tools for success for reentering society. As we learned this week co-occurring disorders are common among PWMI in the criminal justice system which often requires different and multiple screening assessments because one disorder (such as substance use) may not be picked up during a screening of another (such as depression) because it is clinically difficult to differentiate between the two. Integrating the services together can allow for more screenings with the possibility of correctly identifying those with co-occurring disorders."
1077,"There are many things that could have prevented Timothy Souders from dying in prison. The first is proper training for police officers that are out on patrol and are possibly dealing with PWMI. In Timothy's situation at the grocery store, the police officer could have taken him to a hospital rather than to prison right away. If the officer was trained on how to interact with PWMI, Timothy could have gotten the help he needed and deserved before getting thrown in to prison right off the bat. Second, mental health professionals should have been present when Timothy was having major episodes, which the officers deemed as threatening to them. If the psychiatrists were there for consultation and evaluation, Timothy could have been calmed down rather than immediatley chained to his bed.  Third, training for officers within jails and prisons could have prevented Timothy from dying in prison. When he was having an episode, officers took his behavior as threatening. They then proceeded to chain him up and ignored his pleas for water.  With proper training, officers will have the knowledge to interact with inmates, particularly inmates with mental illnesses, in a more positive way and not let the mental illness get in the way of giving an inmate help."
1078,"The history of how PWMI have been treated has been a roller coaster starting in the Pre-Civilization era up until the Pre-Civil War era. Religion was one of the main non-medical aspects that guided the way PWMI were viewed and treated. In the Pre-Civilization and Middle Ages PWMI had their skulls trephinated and were tortured and executed. None of these ""treatments"" were scientifically rooted or proved to cure the mental illness. The only times in history when humane treatment was given was in Ancient Civilizations and in the Renaissance Era. "
1079,"I do not think that the benefits of a national registry of mentally ill persons outweigh the costs. The media has overtaken the narrative of PWMI and how likely they are to commit gun violence. In fact, mentally ill persons are more likely to take their own life rather than the life of others. As seen in the Youtube video, the woman was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and was committed involuntarily, which prompted their guns being taken away. While I do not agree with having guns in the first place, the national registry of mentally ill persons should not be the only factor that determines whether someone should have a gun or not. Not all mentally ill people are violent enough to use guns to harm people. This national registry of mentally ill persons further sets back those with mental illnesses, making it less likely for them to seek help."
1080,"Given the challenges PWMI have faced as a result of deinstitutionalization, I think that the most important problem to fix are the sterotypes and stigma that surround the relationship between mental illness and violence. As seen in all four lectures this week, criminaliztion of mental illness started because people connect mental illness with violence, when in reality, only 4% of PWMI are violent. If violence was not directly correlated to mental illness, then outsiders would be more inclined to help PWMI instead of being scared of them. The breaking down of the violence stigma would break down the challenges that PWMI face as a result of deinstitutionalization."
1081," Mental illness has been viewed from a myriad of different perspectives throughout history. In the pre-civilization era, mental illness was thought to be caused by evil spirits with banishment as a solution (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013). The ancient civilizations believed in physiological explanations for mental illness while emphasizing humane care for patients. The Middle Ages brought with them a religion-based explanation for mental illness - demonic possessions and devil spots. The Renaissance era highlighted humanism that ended torture and execution of PWMI (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013). This idea of humanism and treatment was furthered in the pre-civil war area where treatment was implemented instead of punishment.   A lot of these perceptions about mental illness lead to the question of self-determination or the extent to which a person controls their own life. I believe that all views throughout history, whether it be religion or biologically-based suggest that PWMI did not have as much control over their lives in comparison to persons without mental illness. However, if I were to pick one, I believe that religious-based views of the cause of mental illness, like demonic possession, devil spots, and being a witch lend their hand to a more self-deterministic narrative. During pre-civilization and Middle ages, PWMI underwent trephination, were burned at the stake, drowned, in addition to other forms of torture and execution. This punishment of the PWMI suggests that it was the person’s fault and therefore they must be punished for what they were and how they acted. As the prompt suggests, PWMI were thought to be much less than full-fledged members of society.   Biological and physiological-based views emphasized the treatment of PWMI. Whether it be the more ancient, laxative treatment meant to purify the body, or the psychiatric hospital that were built to not only house, but also treat PWMI. The people with these views saw humanity in patients and attempted (in whatever way they knew how at the time) to treat those individuals and to help them become full-fledged members of society. The biological basis of mental illness did not rely so much on self-determination, but more as uncontrollable medical conditions with possible cures and remedies."
1082,"Hi Briana, I really appreciate the point you bring up from the Ted Talk about the ""us and them"" mentality that we have when speaking about PWMI. Throughout history and your outline of historical views of mental illness, it is easy to see how we have carried and spread that narrative unknowingly. Whether it be through pre-civilization trephination or the middle aged burning at the stake, the separation has always existed. I believe that if everyday people were educated on what mental illness is and that only 4% of PWMI are violent then we would create a much more understanding community that helps PWMI instead of preventing them from getting treatment and bettering their lives. "
1083,"Hi Alyse, You bring up great points about the differing historical perspectives on mental illness. Earlier views of mental illness, like pre-civilization used trephination and middle ages practiced extreme forms of torture and execution - basically punishing PWMI for having these illnesses. I feel that past views have changed, but still exist in a different way. Instead of thinking of such individuals as demonically possessed, society sees them as violent which most often ends up as criminalization of PWMI. As you mentioned, the mental health registry will only create a bigger separation between PWMI and ""full-fledged members of society"" that will be hard if not impossible to recover from."
1084,"A president can be very impactful in bringing and end to the stigma of mental illness. As we saw in the video, President Obama explained that seeking help for mental health issues should be done with as much ease as seeking help for a broken arm or the flu. When a person of such power stresses the importance of mental health or any other concept, it means that it is an issue that impacts almost every single person. Not only is that message important, but it necessary to recify. A president can hold press conferences like this to bring more awareness, they can create campaigns that promote the importance of acknowledging mental illness. Both of these create a national dialogue that may foster support for persons with mental illness."
1085,"I think the movement toward reducing benefits for mental health care sends a negative message to PWMI and perpeturates the stigma around mental illness as a whole. When cuts are made to mental health services (e.g. psychiatric evaluations, medication distribution, etc.) it makes PWMI feel as if they are not ""important"" or ""worthy"" enough to get the help that they desparately need. This view can be easily translated to the the rest of the community seeing PWMI has weak individuals rather than people just trying to get healthier."
1086,"In terms of mental health treatment for active military and veterans I would recommend individual therapy sessions as well as group therapy sessions. Chris, the veteran in the video above, explained that group therapy sessions were most beneficial to him and the other veterans in his group. I think that medications are only necessary as decided by a psychiatrist and can be very beneficial coupled with therapy in groups on individually."
1087,"Given that some PWMI may experience anosognosia, lacking insight into their illness, I think that society should be allowed to step in, but only if they become a threat to themselves or others.  Some PWMI fail to seek treatment knowingly, which is their right. However, I think it would be safe to assume that getting a PWMI help is beneficial not only to the person with a mental illness , but to their family, friends, and the rest of the community. However, if a PWMI that experiences anosognosia is not at risk for hurting themselves or others, I do not think society should be forced to step in and mandate treatment. There are far more people that could be helped first, such as PWMI who cannot afford their treatment, namely homeless individuals or those at a lower socioeconomic status that disables them from getting mental health care. "
1088," Stigma is powerful, and also the most detrimental part of society. In most cases, the benefit of the doubt is taken away from individuals that are seen as “different” and is hard or even impossible to earn back from the public (Rusch, Angermeyer, & Corrigan, 2005). If children and adolescents were to be taught what stigma and its roots are rather than being taught the actual stigma, there might be hope that mental illness stigma and  its other forms are lessened and eventually wiped out from the threads of society.   There are three main forms of stigma, which include structural stigma, public stigma, and self stigma (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013). I believe that public stigma should be combatted first because it influences it prompts both self-stigma and eventually creates structural stigma. If labeling that starts at the public level is less frequent, people will be more unlikely to separate by “us” and “them” and there will be no status loss. As we saw in the video of President Obama in Lecture 2.1, seeking help for mental health issues should be done with as much ease as seeking help for a broken arm or the flu - without a second thought of what people might think or how they will be treated because of their problems (mental or physical). Children should be taught four concepts. First, they should be taught the definition of mental illness. Second, that mental illness is common. Third, that PWMI should be treated with kindness and sympathy instead of a brush to the side and even punished for an illness they cannot control. Lastly, they should be taught to seek help or encourage other PWMI that they might know to seek help. As kids enter high school, they can be taught more of the legal and social consequences that PWMI face if they are continued to be stigmatized. Such consequences include homelessness, substance abuse, and incarceration (McNeil, Binder, & Robinson, 2005). Although, the unraveling of stigmatization of mental illness will not happen overnight, it is vital to helping PWMI and creating a more inclusive and supportive society moving forward."
1089,"Hi Gabby, I wholeheartedly agree with your post. Instead of implicitly or explicitly contributing to mental health stigma, among many others, schools should be combatting and ending it. Being that mental illness is so common, it is very likely that children have a personal experience with mental illness, that they are not aware of. When I think back to my elementary and middle school years, there was no mention of mental illness. In fact, it was something we  did not talk about. I also agree that high school students should learn about the seriousness and consequences that result when mental illness is ignored or made fun of. As you stated and as mentioned in the Lecture 2.4, 30-40% of PWMI commit suicide and cause injury to themselves. This is simply too high and something that could be prevented through more awareness implemented in early education. Like you said, this education will not only lessen the stigmatization of mental illness, but save lives."
1090,"Hi Nani, This is such a great post! I think that the teaching elements that you discussed are perfect in regard to each age group. I never thought of the pamplet idea. I think this would particularly speak to the younger children and help them recognize that there is no shame having a mental illness or helping someone with one. Namely, that mental illness is normal and should be treated with as much urgency as any other health problem - by seeking help. I think that another thing to teach high schoolers and and the general public would be the negative consequences of stigmatizing PWMI, which include homelessness, incarceration, substance abuse, and suicide  (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013)."
1091,"If specificity were to be applied to decisions about civil commitment, it would refer to individuals who do not actually have a mental health issue and are predicted to not have a mental health issue or a true negative.  If sensitivity were to be applied to decision about civil commitment, it would refer to individuals who actually have a mental issue and are predicted to have a mental health issue or a true positive. A false positive would represent an individual that is predicted to have a mental health issue when they really do not. This could be detrimental to the individual becaues they are being diagnosed and maybe even prescribed medicine that they do not really need. This is also unecessarily labeling them as a PWMI which holds stigma, as we've learned last week. A false negative would represent an individual who is predicted to not have a mental health issue when they really do. This is particularly detrimental to the individual because they will not be getting the help they need if their mental health issue is not predicted. This also means that there are many individuals in society that are living with undiagnosed mental illnesses.     "
1092,"I think that involuntary commitment of sex offenders after they complete their sentences is both good and bad. It is good because people that might reoffend are kept off the streets, but it is bad because people are still being kept from society. I believe that if involuntary commitment stays provided real therapy and treatment to sex offenders to actually make them better, they would be beneficial. However, if no real therapeutic resources are given, then involuntary civil commitment serves no purpose and might even make sex offenders mad for being locked up in addition to the sentence they already served. Another reason why involuntary civil commitment is a bad idea is that they were sentenced to a certain length of time, which they already served. "
1093,"I consider inpatient commitment to be the larger reach of state authority into an individual's liberty because inpatient commitment requires individuals to stay at a place that is not there home to receive treatment. Whereas, in outpatient committment, individuals are able to live their lives out in the community. I think any treatment that physically keeps patients from their normal lives and contributing to society will always be a larger reach of authority. Individuals in inpatient commitment simply have no freedom to be themselves whether they are receiving treatment they actually need or not. With outpatient commitment, individuals still get to hold on to some of their liberty while still getting the treatment they might need. "
1094," Although each state has their own criteria for involuntary hospitalization, all states require that the individual has a mental illness (Burley & Morris, 2015). Some of the goals and pros of inpatient commitment are that it provides treatment for those who are in need of it, it prevents self-harm, and societal harm, and it takes the burden off of family and friends who provide for the patient’s needs (Burley & Morris, 2015). On the other side, some of the cons of inpatient commitment are that it is coercive, anti-therapeutic from the feelings of coercion, stigmatizing by perpetuating the violence myth, and discriminatory (Risdon, Buffington-Vollum & Johnson, 2013).   Some of the pros of outpatient commitment include patients getting to live out in the community and going on with their lives and that it in some cases, prevents inpatient commitment from occurring. Cons include coercion through forced medication, stigmatization, anti-therapeutic from feelings of coercion, and that there is limited availability of resources that occurs in some states (Risdon, Buffington-Vollum & Johnson, 2013). Discrimination is a major con of outpatient commitment. Swanson et al. (2009) found that black patients and, furthermore, black male patients were hospitalized at higher rates than any other race in the target population.   In terms of the individual, the first appropriate measure of success for inpatient and outpatient commitment are that the patient actually  wants  to be in treatment. This will hardly be the case 100% of the time, whether it be due to anosognosia (lack of insight into one’s mental illness (Risdon, Buffington-Vollum & Johnson, 2013)) or the desire for freedom, but I think success can be obtained if coercion is replaced with education on their mental illness. Another measure of success for would be visible improvement in the patient’s lives and mental states.   In terms of society, the first measure of success for inpatient and outpatient commitment are that patients are able to sustain healthy and meaningful relationships with their family and friends during and after treatment. Another vital measure of success would be the destruction of the violence myth in PWMI. Society should"
1095,"Hi Elise, I enjoyed reading your post! I think you bring up a really good point about how a con of inpatient involuntary hospitalization and the unfamiliar surroundings that it comes with could exaggerate a patient's symptoms and may make it harder for their condition to improve. I can only imagine what my experience would be like if I were in tne patient's position. A con I listed was discrimination of individals within the target population. Swanson et al. (2009) found that black male patients were more likely to be hospitalized in the target population of mentally ill individuals. Lastly, the suggestion for improvement you made is so important to the well-being of patients in each facility whether they are inpatient or outpatient care. According to your suggestion, would the clinical or forensic psychologist play a big role in deciding whether the patient is ready to be released from treament or vice versa?"
1096,"Hi Jennifer, You bring up some really good points. You brought up grave disability in your post, I forgot to add that in mine! The measure of success you bring up regarding absence of immediate threat is integral and a perfect starting point because harming oneself or harming others should be of top importance. Do you think that when a patient is cleared from being dangerous, they can be released into outpatient commitment? As we learned this week, outpatient commitment let's patients live out in the community so that they get a chance to contribute to society (Risdon, Buffington-Vollum & Johnson, 2013) and that in and of itself is a success, partly because the alternative would be hospitalization without admittance until their condition improves."
1097,"I think the most difficult stage for PWMI to navigate would be corrections.  I think it would be corrections because they would most likely not be getting the mental health care that they require. Jail and prison are challenging environments that are not conducive to caring for PWMI. Therefore, PWMI are more likley to be misunderstood and wrongfully punished for their actions.  Wrongful punishments could possibly aggravate a PWMI'S mental illness leading to further ""misbehavior."" This could snowball and result in physical harm to the inmate for not following the rules the way they are ""supposed to"". Jail and prison also exposes them to other inmates who may not understand mental illness and will be further stigmatized and victimized simply because they have a mental illness. "
1098,"The first challenge that might arise for PWMI as a result of changes in California corrections would be that jails they would be moved to would be overcrowded.  The second challenge would be that individuals with serious mental health problems would remain in prison. I think this is particularly problematic because PWMI and PWSMI (especially) would benefit from medical and therapeutic treament instead of the most times harsh prison environment.  However, a potential benfit would be that the savings resulting from resentecing would be spent on mental health and substance abuse services, which would directly benefit PWMI with such problems. Since Prop 57 has a greater focus on rehab, prisoners would be just that: closer to rehabilitation."
1099,"It is not fair that police often serve as first responders to situations involving PWMI. As seen in the video above, a woman suffering from schizophrenia was shot and killed by police when she did not have to be. I believe that if police officers were better trained in  how to deal with PWMI, that less fatalities would occur and that the police would have a more robust understanding of PWMI and want to help them instead of harm them. I think that having a trained mental health professional with them who is also trained in police tactics could be beneficial, but if that is not the case, I think that providing officers with all the knowledge of mental illness and how to interact with PWMI would be the safest bet for them and for PWMI. Although it might take more time to train officers on mental health, it would save countless lives in the future. "
1100,"Stigma is most times a driving force behind violence towards PWMI. CIT has been proven to reduce stigmatizing attitudes towards PWMI and therefore reduce injuries, shootings, and deaths of PWMI and police officers. In CIT training are taught the signs and symptoms of mental illnesses, the types of medications PWMI may be on and their effects, de-escalation techniques (as shown in the lecture video), and are even given the opportunity to interact with people who use mental health services. With all of these teachings, stigma is reduced and police are better equipped to act empathetically to individuals they come in contact with. "
1101," Based on Taheri’s (2016) findings, I would still suggest the continued use of the CIT model for PWMI. Although, findings showed that arrest rates did not go down, there was an increase in police officers taking PWMI to mental health organizations in the community instead of arresting them, when compared to police officers who did not utilize CIT (Taheri, 2016). This is a huge step because PWMI are being given the chance to get resources they need and may be more likely to manage their illness in a way that works for them. If they were not to get these community-based mental health services, they would go to jail where their mental illness might become criminalized  (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013) , they might unnecessarily be seen as violent or non-functioning due to their mental illness, which can only be more detrimental to a person’s mental health and prompt future run-ins with the law. Typical CIT training consists of officers learning the signs and symptoms of various mental illnesses and learning about different medications and their effects. They also learn de-escalation techniques, which turns out to be a big part of interacting with PWMI (Taheri, 2016). If the CIT approach were to be discontinued, officers would lose their 40 hours of learning de-escalation techniques and be more prone to use violence in situations where they feel threatened (Oliva, Morgan & Compton, 2010). Knowing de-escalation techniques not only saves PWMI’s lives, but officers lives as well.   Being that only 8 studies were analyzed in Taheri (2016), I think that future studies should work on obtaining a more robust sample of studies, so that we might be able to learn more about arrest rates in CIT trained officers and non-CIT trained officers in addition to what the long-term impacts of using the CIT approach might mean for both police officers and PWMI.   References  Oliva, J. R., Morgan, R. & Compton, M. T. (2010) A practical overview of de-escalation skills in law enforcement: Helping individuals in crisis while reducing police liability and injury.  Journal of Police Crisis Negotiations. 10, </i> 15-29."
1102,"Hi Nani, You make some really important points here! I also think that the CIT program should be continued. With police officers referencing their training Taheri (2016) found that officers were more likely to take PWMI to get community-based mental health services. As mentioned in the video we watched in Lecture 4, officers learning empathy is one of the biggest parts of this program being successful. Having officers learn these skills in their work is vital to PWMI's lives and even officers lives, themselves.  I think your suggestions are both manageable and could be highly benefical. I think having yearly training is great, because throughout the year, officers come into contact with many PWMI and at each yearly training, officers are building layers and layers of seasoned knowledge for their future interactions with PWMI. "
1103,"Hi Elise,  I totally agree with what you've said in your post. I also agree with what Taheri (2016) discusses in his article regarding the positive impacts that CIT training has on both police officers and PWMI. PWMI are getting the help they need and police officers are better able to empathize with the people they interact with on a daily basis whether they have a mental illness or not. I also think that more research needs to be done to get a more accurate representation on the effects of CIT training. It would be hard to say that CIT does no good and should be elimated from police officer training because it does so much good, like giving PWMI access to services that they might otherwise not get. In some cases, they might even be arrested for their behavior that they see as ""violent"" when we know that is not necessarily the case.  (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013)."
1104,"It is hard for me to imagine what it must be like for a PWMI to be arrested and jailed more than 100 times. I'd have to think that it might be like hope getting ripped away from you or as if nothing that you do, will every result in anything good. To be continually brought to jail not only tells a PWMI that they are not fitting in with society, but that they will be punished for not doing so. I think it is especially detrimental because PWMI's actions are easily criminalized compared to people without mental illnesses. Not only are they brought into jail, but they are being forced to live in small space with other inmates and officers that may not understand their mental health struggles. I think that what most PWMI feel is frustration with the police, frustration with the criminal justice system itself, and frustration with themselves. This can only make their mental health symptoms worse, resulting in a higher likelihood of future run-ins with the law. "
1105,"The first indicator and one that makes most sense to me is whether someone is on medication or not. Most people suffering from mental illness and who have talked to a doctor about it will most likely be on anti-psychotic medication. However, this would have to be measured after they are admitted and have seen a psychiatrist. Most PWMI will not come into jail already being on meds, due to their limited access. A second indicator could be an individual's criminal history. As we saw in Lecture 5.1, some inmates have gone to jail in the triple digits, and most of them have mental illness or serious mental illnesses. Although, inmates who do not have mental illnesses also have multiple jail visits, this might be a good indicator that jails should measure about mental illness to really see the way that jails can be treated as a mental hospital when they are not.  A third indicator for jails to measure about mental illness could be whether a person had ever had treatment for a mental illness. A person who went to jail might have gotten diagnosed with a mental illness, then might be back in jail after a few years. If jails were to look at a person's history with mental illness, it would be a great way to measure how many of their inmates are still suffering from a mental illness.   "
1106,"I think that jail inmates are given enough rights in order to serve their time smoothly. Although, in reality, we know that a lot of these rights are not always fulfilled to the best of the government's, state's, and county's ability. Inmates have the right to physical and mental health care, the right to practice any religion they choose, and the right to a hearing, etc.  I do not think that inmates have too few rights, but I think thatthey should at least have the right to adequate planning so that recidivism levels are decreased.  "
1107,"Given that medication costs make up a large percentage of jail budgets, I think it is the most common treatment, because it can result in fast pacification of symptoms of mental illness. I think a big part of why medication is used instead of other methods is that medications literally act as a placebo for the criminal justice system. By them giving inmatea physical resources that have been clincally proven to treat MI symptoms, the criminal justice system feel slike they are giving inmates a tangible solution to their problems. Another reason why medication consumes large percentages of jail budgets are that therapeutic treatments do not always show outwardly on an inmate. Since therapy is meant to treat internal and emotional struggles, there is not always a visible sign of improvement. Whereas with medication, the visible bettering is the act of giving the medication itself. "
1108," The use of jails for persons with serious mental illnesses are drastically inappropriate. As we saw in the Youtube video in Lecture 5.1, jails were described as the “new insane asylums,” housing PWMI who should be getting help in mental health hospitals with appropriate access to medications and staff that understand the effects of mental illness. A major realignment to the justice system occurred because inmates were dying at enormous rates and overcrowding meant poor health care, so CA was tasked to reduce its prison population in just 2 years  (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013).  Although Realignment policy changes keep persons with a serious mental illness in prison, it leaves out and forces PWMI to be put into jails (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013).  Jails, by definition, are more chaotic than prisons and are infamously underfunded and understaffed, which make interacting with inmates without mental illnesses hard. This then makes the jail staff’s ability to interact with PWMI exponentially harder  (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013). Given the lack of funding that goes to everyday jail resources, it is not surprising that there are serious needs not being met for PWMI. Such need are medications that combat their symptoms of mental illness, therapeutic treatment, and with staff that are trained in de-escalation techniques. This means that PWMI are getting the short end of the stick and both their physical and mental health needs are not being met. The Sheriff who runs the Cook County Jail  said something in the Lecture 5.1 Youtube video that really resonated with the way PWMI are treated in the justice system. He stated, “This is a population [PWMI] that people don’t care about. And so as a result of that there are not the resources out there to care for them.” This was appalling to hear, mainly because PWMI are people who just need a little help to become mentally healthier and a lot of times when their mental state is improved, their physical health and outlook on life changes with it. To deprive PWMI of treatment and resources that can really help them is unethical and unjustifiable."
1109,"Hi Stephanie, I definitely agree with your sentiments. The use of jails for persons with mental illness is only bad news. Knowing that PWMI need proper treatment and people that know how to interact with them  (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013), it is clear that jail is not the place to house them. Moving PMWI to jails essentially prevents them from getting the help they need. In theYoutube video in Lecture 5.1, the Cook County Sheriff stated that a lot of the PWMI were in jail because they stole food, so they could eat or that they were arrested for trespassing into a house so that they could sleep. He also stated that a lot of inmates with a mental illness were arrested 100 even 400 times. This just goes to show that jail basically makes PWMI function the same if not worse than they had before they were arrested. "
1110,"Hi Liisa, I really enjoyed reading your post! I agree that jails should not be doing the job of rehabilitation programs because they can barely house inmates that do not have a mental illness. If they are barely getting the food, educational resources, space in a bed that they need, this only means that those lacking resources affect PWMI even more   (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013). It is truly sad that people who are in need of medications and therapeutic treatment are not getting them. Jails are essentially creating a cycle. When inmates come out, they are unprepared for re-entry and commit a crime and are back in jail once again. "
1111,"I do not necessarily think it is fair to use risk assessment tools when they are not 100% accurate. However, I do think that risk assessment tools are a useful when used in conjuction with other unstructured risk assessment tools, like an unstructured clinical interview, where a mental health professional gets to ask open-ended questions to the individual. I think that risk assessment tools are a great foundation to the topics that should be considered when determining risk. Such topics include substance abuse history, criminal history, living situation, characteristics of offense, and anti-social personality characteristics. "
1112,"I think the core principles of the RNR approach sound good on the surface, but I think that mental health professionals wouls be hesitant to use the RNR approach because there is not much evidence that provess that it works for PWMI. I think that in addition to recidivism rates of PWMI under community supervision, the individual's mental state along with their living situation are the top two factors to consider. Will the PWMI be able to maintain a healthy mental state while not under direct around-the-clock supervision? Where will this person be living once they are released from custody? These are the questions that will give mental health professionals a glimpse as to how PWMI will function post-incarceration. "
1113,"I think that probation is set up fairly well to address the supervision and treatment of PWMI. First, probation does not keep PWMI from being in the community. As we saw in the Youtube video in Lecture 5.2, some PWMI in the Cook County Jail had been in jail anywhere from 1-100+ times. Since PWMI are given a ""second chance"" and get to stay out of jail, they are able to be rehabilitated instead of punished. Second, probation gives PWMI a chance to be given some form of treatment for their mental illness. This helps education PWMI on their symptoms and how to manage them.  To me, probation is the better alternative to jail. A person who was to be incarcerated now gets to rehabilitate in the community, where they hopefully have friend and family support and are not exposed to the jails that lack resources to care for PWMI."
1114,"As a participant in mental court, I would like think that I would feel a sense of comfort that a court specialized in handing cases with PWMI would be deciding what happens to me and if I might get treatment and medication. I would most definitley prefer that to traditional court because the judges in mental health courts understand the symptoms of mental illness and how PWMI's actions are popularly misunderstood in a criminal justice setting. As discussed in this lecture, the judge acts more as a coach instead of a blatant determiner of fate. As the prosecutor mentioned in the first segment of the Youtube video, re-offense rates of PWMI that go through mental health courts are quite low. Mental Health courts give PWMI a chance to do better and be better. "
1115," The Risk Needs Responsivity (RNR) Model is based on three core bases. The “Risk” principle is a focus on higher-risk offenders  (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013)  or to match the degree of service to the likelihood of an offender to re-offend (Bonta & Andrews, 2006). The “Needs” principle is when criminogenic needs are of main focus in treatment (Bonta & Andrews, 2006). Lastly, the “Responsivity” principle focuses on the offender learning during their mental health treatment. There is a primary focus on tailoring such treatment to the individual offender’s learning abilities so they can get the most out of it (Slate et al., 2013; Bonta & Andrews, 2006). While this is a promising model that focuses on the rehabilitation of the offender, Skeem, Steadman, and Manchak (2015) have some reservations about the generalizability of limited past research to PWMI. Instead, they urge that it is important to keep in mind that PWMI pose many new and more complex factors in treatment and the overall process of probation (Skeem et al., 2015).  If I were to give a Chief Probation Officer guidance on the supervision of MI on probation, I would hit three important points: (1) Comparably few crimes are directly driven by symptoms of mental disorders (Peterson, Skeem, Kennealy, Bray, & Zvonkovic, 2014) (2) The RNR model may have different outcomes when applied to PWMI and persons without mental illness (Peterson et al., 2104) and (3) Rehabilitation is vital to helping PWMI function in the community after arrest (Slate et al, 2013). First, while symptoms and criminal behavior vary amidst offenders, it is important to address any assumptions about PWMI that a Chief Probation Officer might have about mental illness symptoms and the committal of a crime. Second, past evidence-based research conducted on PWMI might have different outcomes with PWMI. This would be important for a Chief Probation Officer to know when planning the rehabilitation needs of the offender and that PWMI might need more attention in the treatment area. Lastly, rehabilitation in the community is one of the key solutions to reducing recidivism rates (Bonta & Andrews, 2006; Peterson et al., 2014; Skeem et al., 2015; Skeem et al., 2017) and helping offenders thrive in the community.  <span style=""font-weight:"
1116,"Hi Cornise, I really enjoyed reading your post. You bring up a lot of important points about the training of probation officers. I did not even touch upon this in my post. I think that this is a great idea because probation officers are dealing with PWMI everyday, multiple times a day. If they are able to develop a better understanding of PWMI in training, it will help them realize some key points that were touched upon in this week's readings. A main point would be that few crimes are the direct cause of mental illness symptoms (Peterson et al., 2014).  Another thing that I think would help probation officers is being aware of the importance of rehabilitation to PWMI, especially reintegrating back into the community with a chance of serving their sentence outside of prison. "
1117,"Hi Elise, Great post! I really apprecite that you emphasized the importance of being strict, yet understanding. When thinking about the criminal justice system and PWMI, the common theme has been understnding, like you said. However, criminal justice systems are still required to hold individuals accountable for their actions in different ways. The point you made about stability is a integral one as well. Sometimes PWMI are unable to find and keep adequate housing due to the stigma that surrounds mental illness (Rusch, Angermeyer, & Corrigan, 2005), so I think having probation officers be aware of this will help them do their job and subsequently help PWMI in the community. "
1118,"I think almost all aspects of the prison environment negatively influence the condition of PWMI with the exception of access to medication and therapeutic treatment. The first major aspect would be the correctional officers that might not have the skills and knowledge to interact with PWMI. Officers that do not understand the symptoms of mental illness might end up escalating a situation with a PWMI when they could have handled the situation a different way. The second aspect would be violence in prisons. A PMWI might not know how to handle a violent environment might lash out themselves when they otherwise would not have. Also, PWMI might be victimized by other inmates."
1119,"I do not know for sure if it is possible to ever truly rehabilitate prisoners with mental illness. I think true rehabilitation depends on the severity of the mental illness, the prisoner's reaction to treatment in general, the prisoner's relationship with their mental health provider, their reaction to their medications if they need them, and the way that others (fellow inmates, correctional officers, family that visits them) treat them and support them. While true rehabilitation is hard to predict, I think that prisoners who fall into the right categories can be rehabilitated if they have the right medicinal, therapeutic, and interpersonal support. If they do not, I do not think prisoners can be truly rehabilitated to the point of being successful without mental health care. "
1120,"I feel as if the disadvantages of solitary confinement greatly outweigh the advantages of maintaining prison order. Inmates often end up on solitary confinement when their behaviors and actions are misunderstood by other inmates and correctional officers which may lead to aggression and lashing out by the PWMI. PMWI are usually not inherently violent, but when pushed around aggressively by others in the prison environment, can become temporarily violent, like any other person might. If prisons focused on the root of the problem, examing their implicit biases and learning how to interact with PWMI, solitary confinement of PWMI would majorly decrease both negative interactions between officers and PMWI, but decrease the use of solitary confinement overall. "
1121,"I agree with the second person that spoke in the video that there should be more community-based mental health services. This could prevent PWMI from becoming incarcerated and help them be a better functioning member of society. However... and this is a big however, this does not mean that zero funding should go into treating PWMI in prison, but that there should be a stronger focus on providing mental health care in the communities. As discussed in the video, implementing mental health treatment in prison costs exponentially more than community-based methods. Putting an equal funding focus on community-based and prison-based can help people in prison and people outside of prison."
1122," One of the most complex management issues within the criminal justice system is the relationship between the treatment, control, and funding of inmates, especially inmates with mental illnesses (Adams & Ferrandino, 2008). As discussed in this week’s lectures and readings, there is a marked disconnect between inmate needs and the actual resources that are available for treatment (Adams & Ferrandino, 2008). This disconnect results in major consequences for PWMI inside prisons. Byrne & Roberts (2007) discussed that mentally ill inmates require a different approach from other inmates to address their mental health care needs. Furthermore, they suggest that mental health experts take a multidimensional approach where inmates and their therapists address several problems at once instead of disintegrating them throughout their stay (Byrne & Roberts, 2007). This might create more costs for allocating mental health professionals for inmates, but it there is a possibility that it helps PWMI be able to positively manage their symptoms. Therefore, they should receive more resources if needed. Another way to provide treatment for PWMI while still containing costs could be separating them from certain conditions in the prison environment (Adams & Ferrandino, 2008). Carr et al., (2006) emphasize that PWMI tend to have greater difficulty socializing with other inmates, which have consequences such as further victimization and acting out (Slate et al., 2013). As discussed in lecture this week, rates of sexual victimization are twice as high for PWMI and up to 30% engage in self-injurious behaviors (Slate et al., 2013). Separating PWMI in prisons would be beneficial for both staff and inmates if there was a space where they could live, without fear of being victimized by other inmates because of their mental illness (Adams & Ferrnadino, 2008). Additionally, this separate area should have correctional officers who have been trained in the CIT approach or who know the symptoms of mental illness and how to de-escalate heated situations. Although this could cost more, the separation could save on medical costs and result in a more harmonious living environment for all inmates.   References  Adams, K., Ferrandino, J. (2008).

1123,"Hi Amber, I really enjoyed reading your post! It is a great synthesis of sources and useful suggestions for how to house PWMI within the prison system.  I definitley agree with you in your point that PWMI should receive more resources. Resources, which I would assume include therapeutic treament increased access to medication (although it currently takes up most of the budget (Slate, et al., 2013)) would only help PWMI with their self-image and help them function within the prison itself.  I think that the current model that prisons are using which ignores the needs of PWMI, is counterintuitive because when such needs are being met, it can result in increased sexual victimization and self-injurious behavior that then contribute to the use of more medical resources.  I also posit that it might be helpful for CO's to be trained in de-escalation techniques whe interacting with inmates with mental illnesses. Do you think that it would be helpful for CO's to undergo CIT training that we discussed in Week 4?"
1124,"Hi Liisa, I enjoyed reading your take on this week's discussion topic! It was definitley a hard one to think about, especially consdering the many factors that PWMI face while inside prison in addition to the specific funds that are allocated toward funding the treatment for PWMI in prison. Like Karen mentioned in her reply, I appreciate that time you take to discuss the role of medication in prisons. From the lectures, it certainly seems like an easy fix to psychiatrists. Do you think that psychiatrists tend to prescribe medications rather than putting a bigger focus on therapuetic treatment because the act of giving medication seems like a physical way to stop the problem, whereas telling a person to go to therapy has no immediate physical proof of improvement? The only reason I ask is because psychology is seen as more social subject than a scientific one in some schools of thought. I think that if psychiatrists were to put more faith in therpeutic treatments, it would both cut down on medication costs and help PWMI readjust to the community, so that they do not have to rely on medications."
1125,"If I was a taxpayer in Missouri, I would be proud that my money is going to the construction of the new Fulton State Hospital... that is if its advocates are actually going to do what they say they are. The lady in the second half of the video made a good point in that the first state hospital was built when there was no such thing as group therapy and that their treatment philosophy has changed. Hopefully the Fulton State Hospital will not only provide necessary medications for those that need them, but also therapeutic one-on-one treatments, group therapy, creative outlets for patients, and the structure for the patients to thrive. The view of mental health care has gone from a scary, harsh one to a more encouraging and supporting one. "
1126,"I would not necessarily describe the ""Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity"" a ""Get Out of Jail Free"" card. Although defendants did commit a crime, it does not mean they get to roam free on the streets. It means that they are seen not criminally responsible for their crime due to their mental illness and instead must serve time in a state mental hospital and get treatment for as long as their most serious offense allots. This punishment makes sense to me for persons determed not guilty by reason of insanity because they are truly individuals that need serious mental health care. As mentioned by Lionel in the supplemental video, about 1% of persons plea not guilty by reason of insanity and about 1/4 of that 1% are actually granted that plea. Therefore, it is used in cases where it us appropriately applied and PWMI get serious treatment while serving their time."
1127,"I think state hospitals can best deal with patient and staff safety with increased security and increased staff. As seen in the video, nurses are equipped to give the care to patients, but they are still vulnerable to dealing with a patient without security. I think that in addition to having nurses, there needs to be more nurses and professional security guards who are also trained to work with patients with mental illnesses. Like the two nurses mentioned in the video, they sometimes have to get the help of kitchen cooks and housekeepers to help restrain patients. Although the director of the department of mental health said that those individuals are trained in mental health procedures, they are not as trained as the nurses who deal with it on a daily basis. Mental health hospital officials need to be held more accountable for both their patient's and nurse's lives."
1128,"I think that doctors using deep brain stimulation as treatment for depression seems beneficial, as long as the patient is okay with the procedure and the odds of the procedure working or not. I do not think that the procedure is unethical in any way because if has seemed to help many. When asked if she had any doubts in going through with the procedure, the woman said, that she had basically nothing to loose because she had no hope and no motivation to keep going. This procedure is used in patients who have not responded to medications and/or therapeutric treatments, so using this as a last resort with a history of good results means that there is hope for those that experience severe, major depression. "
1129," According to the Acting Director of the California Department of State Hospitals (DSH), their goal is to not only help patients on a day-to-day basis, but to set them up for a lifetime of continued progress and success. According to Fisher, Geller, and Pandiani (2009), state hospitals provide increasingly important services to PWMI and persons suffering from serious mental illness. More specifically, they are not simply places that house PWMI, but institutions that help patients physically and mentally (DHS, 2018). State hospitals should therefore continue to provide patients with the proper treatment tools for facilitating competency and living with a mental illness. In this post, I will discuss both the negative and positive views of state hospitals and why they may be important for housing forensic patients in particular.    The negative view of state hospitals include its prison-like environment which is not conducive to rehabilitation, they are in far locations that can be hard for families to visit, and are ill-equipped (i.e. staffing quantity and quality) to handle persons with mental illnesses. Lecture 8.3’s accompanying video, showcased two nurses that were physically harmed during several of their shifts in a Massachusetts state mental hospital, further describing that sometimes housekeepers and kitchen staff help nurses when staff is low. However, some of the benefits of state hospitals are that they allow patients to “constructively change” by having consistent medication delivery, a better living environment, and are getting at caring for severely mentally ill patients than prisons and jails.   It does already seem that California state hospitals are comprised almost exclusively of forensic patients (90% forensic commitment, 10% civil commitment. In fact, forensic commitments are comprised of individuals found incompetent to stand trial, “mentally disordered,” and not guility by reason of insanity (Fisher et al., 2009). I think housing forensic commitment patients in state hospitals is a better alternative to community-based treatment because they may be too unstable to too unsafe (Sisti, Segal, & Emanuel, 2015). Additionally, I think that forensically committed patients would benefit from the structure, consistent treatment, and fuller living environment that state hospitals offer."
1130,"Hi Danielle, I definitley understand where you are coming from in your decision process. The view of psychiatric hospitals and asylums has always been a negative one prior to pursuing this education. I also came to the conclusion after this week's readings and lectures that state hospitals are staffed with health care providers well-versed in mental illness. This is vital to treating PWMI because, a major theme of this course has been PWMI's interactions with police officers, prison, probation, and many more (Slate et al., 2013). Housing forensic patients in state hospitals is also benefial if such patients are unstable or unsafe to participate in community based treatments. I appreciate that you mentioned that prisons are already a default psychiatric facility and are almost always ill-equipped for housing and rehabilitating PWMI. I think the pros surpass the cons of housing forensic patients in state hospitals. "
1131,"Hi Stephanie, Great post! I also stated that the role of state hospitals in housing PWMI is vital to the safety of staff, the safety of patients, and the quality of treatment that state hospitals are able to provide. I similarly expressed that forensic patients (individuals deemed incompetent to stand trial, patients with mental disorders, and individuals found not guilty by reason of insanity) should ""serve their time"" in state hospitals (Fisher et al., 2009). As I mentioned in my own post, these individuals might be too unstable or unsafe to recieve treatment out in the community, so state hospitals that are equipped with properly trained staff, consistent medication delivery, and facilitate constructive change might be the best option for forensic patients. "
1132,"The described forms of data sharing in the above video seem strikingly subpar. The man on the right discussed that there is a miscommunication in the way that agencies share information about inmate's mental illness. One agency might have been aware of the person's mental illness. But when that person gets released and arrested in another agency, there is essentially no record of that person's mental illness. This results in the person's inability manage their mental illness outside of custody and then the lack of care that they are given when they are re-arrested. In order to improve this, a central perhaps state-wide database should be created so that upon booking, the person's mental health history can be seen by both police officers and mental health clinicians. "
1133,"In this video, the calm demeanor of the officers were what stood out as different from a routine law enforcement encounter. Instead of asking questions starkly, they made it a point to acknowledge that the person was upset in stead of telling him to calm down to try to pacify him. They also emphasized to the patient that they would get him the help that he needed. They even went as far to describe the specific services and what the process going forward would be for the person. At no point were they forceful with him and they helped him make the decision to get help for himself. They also made sure that the girlfriend of the victim was okay and that she was getting the help that she needed right then and there at the scene. The director of the crisis training organization discussed that the process was a little longer than the normal routine law enforcement encounter, but that it ensured a positive, non-violent outcome for all parties. "
1134,"I think that it often takes a court order or other legal actions for departmetns of corrections to change the way PWMI are treated because specialized training takes up time and resources. Not only do officers and other personnel have to spend time to be trained, but a whole program with mental health professionals needs to be put together to then develop curriculum and present it to officers with enough intensity so that the learners actually absorb the information and use it out in the field. Mental health has always beend looked at as a 'last resort' topic that a lot of people, law enforcement, in particular do not see as important. I think that stigma also has a lot to do with it. Instead of PWMI being seen as individuals that need help, they are seen as violent, troubled, and ""weird."" Most people in the field of criminal justice do not see PWMI as needing help, but those who should be punished. "
1135,"Mental health workers might have to deal with not only persons with mental illnesses, but with individuals that live in the prison environment. Which is so much different from talking with someone for a therapy session at a private practice. Having mental health workers that are well-versed in the complexities of the prison environment (i.e. intake process, medical facilities, day-to-day life, etc.) greatly influences the inmate's view of them as well. As mentioned in the video, inmates can tell when a counselor or therapist is being inauthentic, therefore, it is so important that mental health workers can visualize what people go through and treating them like normal people out in the world. Cross-training with correctional staff is so important becaues mental health workers are not correctional officers/staff. So the more that knowledge is widened and learned by all, the better chances that mental health workers and inmates have of succeeding in treatment."
1136," This week’s lectures discussed how court actors and mental health professionals can be better prepared to interact with PWMI. They all included tenants that reminded me of CIT training. CIT training includes being educated on different mental illnesses along with recognizing their symptoms and signs. Although most mental health workers are well-versed in these signs, I believe knowing this is vital to law enforcement (Taheri, 2016), judges, prosecutors, district attorneys, and to all individuals who work with with PWMI (Watson, & Fulambarker, 2012). Another trademark teaching of the CIT model is the knowledge of psychotropic drugs and their effects. This is particularly important for law enforcement when they are out in the field and dealing with many people with mental illnesses. Judges would benefit from knowing the about psychotropic drugs because such effects might impact the way the defendant behaves in court and might give them a better overall understanding of the defendant’s perspective in general. I think knowledge of medications is important for district attorneys who may have clients that have a mental illness and are taking medications. When district attorneys meet with their clients that are on medications, having a deeper understanding of why they act the way they do will help district attorneys in the way they explain their case and strategies for trial. This knowledge is important to prosecutors as well when deciding how to charge the defendant and how prison might affect the defendant’s mental state in comparison to state hospitals that can provide more robust mental health care (Fisher, Geller, & Pandiani, 2009). CIT also gives its students de-escalation training and opportunities to meet with individuals who depend on mental health care. De-escalation techniques are important because they teach students techniques on how to interact with a PWMI (e.g. talking calmly, reassuring that everything will be okay, explaining what is happening and what will happen, etc.). Meeting with consumers of mental health care are also important because it gives CIT students a direct, real-life perspective on what mental health care can do for PWMI. Being that law enforcement, judges, prosecutors, and district attorneys mostly see the negative result of a crime (understandably), I think exposing them to the rehabilitation process of mental illness will motivate them to rethink an automatic punitive punishment. </sp"
1137,"Hi Nicolle, I thoroughly enjoyed reading your post! I also thought that the CIT model would be the most well-rounded choice for teaching court actors and law enforcement about PWMI and mental illness in general. During each lecture this week all of the training topics suggested were reminiscent of CIT training. I immediately thougt back to week 4 when we were introduced to CIT for the first time. CIT, like you mentioned, has not only proven to reduce arrest rates, but it has also reduced stigmatizing attitudes toward mental illness along with increasing officer safety (Taheri, 2016). I really like how you referred using CIT for mental health professionals as ""bridging the gap."" I think that is a perfect way of describing the importance of how different psychology and the criminal justice systems are, but acknowledging that there is a solution to reaching a meeting point between the two fields."
1138,"Hi Steve, I enjoyed reading your perspective, especially knowing your career background. I think if it were to be anyone, you would know best as to what law enforcement and other court actors might need to know working in the field of criminal justice. I think the stigma of mental illness would be a good topic to add to this list! As we learned in week 2, stigma takes place both structually and publicly and can be cyclical in nature (Slate et al., 2013). Do you think that this training could occur annually or even bi-annually to increase knowledge of the above topics?"
1139,"I think that Fairfax focuses on the non-violent offender because there is not a fear that such PWMI will act out. When non-violent offenders are used in diversion efforts, they are more likely to listen to rules and regulations along with being more open to activities that might benefit them. Also, PMWI who are violent might be a little more difficult to handle compared to non-violent offenders. When a fear of violence is non-existent, it is easier to give PWMI the treatment in the community rather than in jail."
1140,"I think the hurdles are different for implementing evidence based practices. As we have discussed all quarter, the criminal justice and mental health systems are very different. I think evidence based practices have a chacne of being implemented in mental health agencies because mental health workers are used to not only reading literature on such practices, but have a profession that is rooted with seeing individuals as needing help rather than seeing them as a threat. The criminal justice system has had a long history of doubting the usefulness of psychological theories and practices and it takes a lot more for new information, especially information that has to do with PWMI."
1141,"I think that an integrated mental health and substance abuse model like the one described in the video would change the way the justice system works with individuals with co-occuring disorders. First, in the criminal justice system there would be an understanding of mental illness and substance abuse individually. Second, there would be an understanding of mental illness and substance abuse together. Not only mental health providers would understand co-occurring disorders, but law enforcement and judicial officials would have a better understanding between mental illness and substance abuse. As mentioned in this lecture, it is important for both mental health and judicial officials to know that relapse is common and may be affected depending on whether someone is serving time in a prison, jail, or out in the community. Also, a better understanding of the relationship between mental illness and substance abuse is vital for field professionals to know whe interacting with PWMI who also have substance abuse issues. "
1142,"I think peer mentoring might be helpful in addressing stigma of mental illness because the mere face that a PWMI has personal mentor let's them know that they have at least one ally in their life that does not judge them, but does quite the opposite - helps them get better. As you can see in the faces of the people above, they seem happy with their mentors and that they have an understanding of their life and their own mind. Not only do the mentors help address stigma in their own daily lives, but they show PMWI that there are people out there who will fight for them, support them, and want them to feel better. The mere feeling of support is helpful to PWMI because of the daily judgements they get. "
1143," The American College of Physicians (ACP) recommends that behavioral health care be integrated into primary care, that public and private health insurance aim to remove payment barriers that will prevent integration, that those who regulate federal and state insurance address behavioral insurance gaps, increase research that examines efficient approaches to integrating behavioral health care into primary care, that training programs are put into place for educators in the workforce, and that those who are enmeshed in health care work to reduce stigma around seeking help for behavioral help (Crowley & Kirschner, 2015).  The affects the involvement of PWMI in the CRJ system because it gives PWMI the chance to seek help where they would in a hospital setting and increase their likelihood of getting help. Getting help sooner for a mental illness, might decrease their severe symptoms. In turn, this might help them secure a job, housing, and decrease their chances of contact with the CRJ system.  These recommendations also affect the identification of PWMI in the CRJ system. According to Rusch, Angermeyer, & Corrigan (2005), PWMI encounter public stigma and subsequently experience self-stigma more frequently than people without a mental illness. If behavioral health care was integrated into the primary health care center, PWMI might be able to manage their mental illness on a more regular basis and may not be identified as a “PWMI” with the stigma that comes with it. On the other hand, medical records that show a record of mental illness might help PWMI get identified sooner. This way, they can be taken to the appropriate treatment center instead of being arrested or left on the street without resources. This also ties into the the treatment of PMWI in the CRJ system.  Crowley and Kirschner’s (2015) recommendations affect the outcomes of PWMI in the CRJ system. When behavioral health care is integrated into primary health care, there is a higher chance that PWMI will be given the chance to get help for their illness instead of immediately seen as violent and punished. As seen in week 5, many PWMI who are released from prison tend to return to custody multiple times - up to 100 and sometimes even more! If caring for someone’s mental health became as normal as caring for our physical hea"
1144,"Hi Karen, Great post! You bring up a lot of really good points about how integrating behavioral health care into primary health care will reduce stigma of mental illness, provide training for those who are unfamiliar, and bring down financial barriers that might block patients from weeking help, especially patients with a mental illness. A reading and our text we were assigned in Week 2 discussed that PWMI not only experience public stigma and structual stigma, but they then experience self-stigma as well (Rusch, Angermeyer, & Corrigan, 2005; Slate et al., 2013). I think that normalizing taking care of our behavioral health is the first step in reducing this stigma not just in the CRJ system, but in society as well."
1145,"Hi Alyse, I really enjoyed reading your post! I'm so glad that you brought up the current default treatment for PWMI. I also apprecite that you mentioned that integrating behavioral health and primary health care as important for stoping the cycle of incarceration and reducing recidivism. If PWMI were seen as people who need help and need the resources to do so, I think that the CRJ system would be more likely to take them to get those resources instead of automatically arresting them."
1146,"If assessments were conducted before Sounders went on trial I think his death could have been avoided. The assessments might have determined that he had a mental illness and therefore could have used the insanity defense and could have received proper care from a hospital instead of going to prison. Also I think if the staff at the prison were more open minded I don't think they would have assumed all prisoners were lying about being mentally ill.  Perhaps even if there were more resources made available to the prisons to educate the staff and provide other options to handle inmates that might have prevented his death. Lastly, I know procedures are put in place to prevent instances like this from happening, however it does not appear that much monitoring or strict regulations are being enforced at the prisons so that is yet another thing that could have prevented Sounder's death."
1147,"Based on the statistics from the video, the benefits do not appear to outweigh the costs. The cons of humiliation, stress, invasion of privacy, rights being violated could prevent people from coming forward and seeking help because they fear the stereotyping they might receive and along with other consequences they worry might occur like civil commitments or holds like the 5150 72 hrs holds the women in the video was forced to go into."
1148,Based on the statistic from the video only 4% of people with a mental illness have been violent which further persuades me that there is not enough evidence to warrant such strict monitoring of people with a mental illness. I can imagine that having a national registry could be more harmful and deter people from seeking treatment.
1149, Perhaps lacking knowledge on the subject matter of mental illness and the lack of progress shown through out history could motivate a treatment plan for people with a mental illness and test to study subjects who are mentally ill.
1150,"Homelessness I think is a huge problem that needs correcting because it puts people with mental illnesses at risk of getting sick or hurt, or worse could lead to their death. They might even end up in prison if they partake in an illegal act as a way to survive on the streets. This could prevent them from receiving the treatment they need. "
1151," I think self determination for people with mental illnesses would be low. I can imagine it would be quite difficult to get past the stigma mentally ill people have faced probably the majority of their lives. It’s like Julie Beck wrote in her article, Untangling Gun Violence from Mental Illness, it is so common for people to assume that if a violent act occurs then the person has to be mentally ill right? I mean only a person who has a mental illness could do something that horrific however, only 4% of violence, not just gun violence, involves people who have a mental illness. I’m sure that after the constant looks and stereotyping ones self-esteem and belief in treatment could take its toll on them. History also has not been kind to people with mental illnesses. In Pre-civilization and the Middle Ages people characterized mental illnesses as being possess by evil spirits (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013; pp. 33-34). History has even shown that mental facilities haven’t been kind to them. Conditions are inadequate and patients were abused (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013; p. 39). That fear of abuse could be a reason why they might hesitate from seeking treatment from professionals.  Because of these assumptions through out history we have been conditioned to perceive mental illnesses as a threat. Like Slate, Buffington-Vollum and Johnson (2013) suggests, what we don’t know causes us panic (p. 47). Going back to Julie Beck’s article, many people assume gun violence is caused by people with mental illnesses but if a mentally ill person does use a gun it is more often going to be used to commit suicide than to hurt the public. Centuries stigma’s about mental illness has absolutely affected how me treat them and our willingness to consider them full-fledged members of society."
1152,"I do agree that society has come a long way since believing there was no help to mentally ill people. Instead of turning ones back to them and banishing them away there are now hospitals set up to help mentally ill people. Resources have been made to provide that support to them. However, I think there is still a lot of stigma linked to violence and mental illness like explained in Julie Beck's article. She explains that the stereotypes a mentally ill person receives can deter them from seeking out treatments. Even though help has been set up for people with mental illness the fear of involuntary, civil commitment, and abuse is still a lingering fear for many people which is why I think self-determination is low."
1153,"We have definitely come a long way from Pre-Civilization. More information has been gathered and awareness has been spread, so acceptance of mental illnesses has evolved however like you I agree more work needs to be done in order to reach the level of society considering mentally ill persons as full-fledged members. Past fear should not dictate the present and future perceptions of them. More resources should be made to inform the public about mental illness. This is crucial so that they can receive the help they need without the fear of repercussions or harsh treatment."
1154,The government wouldn't allow anything or anyone who might be harmful to interact with the president so perhaps with a significant amount of time like someone who has a mental illness stayed with the president or even if he hired someone with a mental illness then people won't be so quick to judge.
1155,The president could also make an announcement to bring awareness but I think showing would be more effective. If he leads by example hopefully society will follow in acceptance.
1156,"By reducing the benefits for mental health care it definitely shows where the policymakers priorities fall.  In my opinion they are not deeming those types of clients/mental health care as ""worthy"" enough to keep their funding  or to increase funding. It says to the public that they care more about providing other clients medical needs than people in need of mental health services at least that's how I'm perceiving it or that they just don't care about mental health care being received. Mental health treatment is extremely poor, the facilities lack the resources needed to keep up with the high demand and that then prevents people from receiving the much needed help they desire. To reduce benefits even more would be detrimental. More resources should be made in effort to support the mental mental health field not diminish. The video explains that resources for mental health is at its lowest its ever been so to cut it even more would be terrible."
1157,"All the side effects that come with the medication are quite troublesome. I would most likely recommend therapy sessions in order for them to come to grips with their trauma. Similar to how the soldier expressed how he dealt with his trauma but minus the drinking. He explains how he first started off drinking and even notes that thats how soldiers commonly start relieving their stress, ""the soldier way"". He was able to get out of that unhealthy coping strategy however others are not that lucky and have probably continued down a dark path by either drinking or drugs. Instead resources should be made early on the discuss the experiences they have faced overseas in order to find healthy coping strategies. Even if symptoms are not appearing a treatment plan should be mandatory so that they can get in front of PTSD. Medication shouldn't be the first method in their course to help active military and veterans. A more natural approach should be made an effort first because the last thing needed is a dependency on drugs and alcohol. "
1158,"I think if the PWMI is a danger to themself or others then that is when others should be allowed to step in and help (i.e. civil commitment). This is already put in place. If the person does not need to be civilly committed then I do not think they should be mandated to do a treatment for any other circumstances. They should have the right, just like everyone else, to decide what treatments they would like to partake in or not partake in. "
1159," I think the curriculum for elementary school should revolve around being kind and respecting others. The stereotyping and discrimination PWMI face won’t resonate with children in elementary school, so I think keeping the curriculum simple should teach the children how to respect everyone! Just as children are taught to treat everyone with kindness and to keep their hands to themselves, they should also learn to not pass judgements onto others. If children learn to stigmatize people at a young age,  for example using  words such as “crazy” or “psycho” to describe someone, then I think it will speak to how they might continue to group people into those categories as they grow older. I think children learn better from examples, so coming up with a scenario on how someone would feel if they were depicted in a certain way that they didn’t like might spark them into the realization that what they say and how they perceive people can hurt others.  In junior high, I think that would be the perfect time to start learning more about mental disorders. Around that time is when I started taking health and learning about the body and how our bodies during that time were going thru puberty. I think another useful subject to learn alongside that topic is a basic overview on different disorders that commonly arise in adolescence and young adulthood. The hope is that it might pique some questions and leave more opportunities for children to be educated on  mental illness.  High School is a great opportunity to expand on what was learned in junior high. The curriculum can discuss myths related to mental illness, such as violence that is falsely linked with mental illness. Facts such as suicides that are found to be the leading cause of death by people with mental illnesses is a prime example of accurate information that should be taught to children. They should be taught there is a low probability someone with a mental illness will attack them and fears to the contrary are largely unfounded. According to our Lecture 3 video, “PWMI are 14 times more likely to be the victim of a violent crime than a perpetrator.” These stigmas prevent PWMI from educational opportunities and limits them from employment possibilities, which can cause homelessness.  It’s like a"
1160,"Hi Denise, Great post! I think your idea for elementary school children is an awesome idea! I think we should start young because in theory then they should grow up knowing that mental illness is not something to be scared of. I think that age is the perfect time to learn because that is the age that social skills are developing and what’s appropriate and what’s not. For example, “treat someone how you would want to be treated”. If you wouldn’t want someone to judge you in a certain light then you shouldn’t judge others in a certain light either especially if that stigma is a myth (I.e. mentally ill people being violent). It’s beneficial to teach from the beginning so that they don’t categorize them into “us versus them”."
1161,"Hi Jennifer, I really enjoyed your post! That is a great suggestion you made about having someone who is diagnosed with a mental illness to speak to the children. I agree that it would be beneficial for children to not just hear about people with mental illness but to interact with a PWMI. They would get to experience and hear the stories of discrimination from someone who has lived it and would be able to connect with it more. I also noted in my post that when health classes begin that’s when children should start learning about disorders/illnesses. I started this in junior high not sex ed just basic health education about puberty and our bodies developing but I think this is a good place to start because sometimes sex education depending on the school doesn’t come until later towards the end of high school if not at all. Being taught from the beginning the myths of violence being cast upon people with mental illness should eliminate the fears people have towards mental illness. This will then make PWMI more likely to come forward and seek the treatment they need."
1162,"A test that might apply to decisions about civil commitment could look at little like this. If someone with a mental illness in the true positive column the person would be a danger to themselves or others and would be civilly committed. The true negative column could like like this: a PWMI is not a risk to themselves/others and is not civilly committed. The false negative column could be that a PWMI is found not a risk to themselves/ others and is not civilly commited when in reality they are and should have been committed and a false positive is the opposite, a PWMI is found to be a risk to themselves/others and is civilly committed when they shouldn't have been."
1163,"This is a tough question to answer because I have two viewpoints. One side of me is saying yes it is a good idea out of concern for what could happen if they are released. This is a common fear others have (like the video mentioned) however, the other side of me the rational side of me has learned that the recidivism for sex offenders is very low. The video even mentions how the plan was to have only the top tier of sexually violent predators involuntarily committed yet, probably only 8% of those classified as such are confined. That means 92% of the population is made up of people who don't fit the bill and that might not require involuntary commitment. I do think though that the treatments they received regardless if it is not a substantial amount of time can prove beneficial."
1164,This is a tough one I can see how both are an overstep but if I had to choose I think I am leaning more towards outpatient commitment. Inpatient commitment can be restrictive they set your schedule and give you limited access to what you can do or where to go and also medications to take but this is because the PWMI is either of danger to themself or others or can no longer take care of themself so the regulations are there to help to patient. With outpatient commitment it is coercive and since the patient is still able to take care of themself and is not a risk to anyone including themself then the overshadowing can be an invasion into the individual's liberty. Especially since medication is forced and if patients do not abide by the outpatient requirements then a patient can be found in content by the courts. This treatment is excessive compared to inpatient commitment.
1165," Inpatient:  Based on this weeks lecture 2 video, the four social goals of inpatient civil commitment are the benefits that come from this form of treatment. The goals are as followed: “1. Provides care and treatment for those who require it. 2. Prevents persons from harming themselves. 3. Society is protected. 4. Relieves society (families) from having to provide care for patient’s need.” In my opinion the four social goals are a pro. The individual as well as their families benefit from such a treatment form because they are provided with a treatment option that the families or individual might lack the resources to get. The third goal then comes into play and makes inpatient civil commitment a pro because the public then feels protected by knowing there are options available to those with mental illness to get the help they need. Another benefit of inpatient commitment is that if the individual lacks the ability to consent to treatment because of their mental illness then the state is allowed to step in (e.g. grave disability) and make the appropriate decisions on behalf of the patient (Slate, Buffington-Vollum & Johnson, 2013). Another pro it that there is a “least restrictive alternative” clause put in place meaning before a person can be civilly committed there must be consider whether another course of one that is less invasive is a more appropriate treatment plan (Slate, Buffington-Vollum & Johnson, 2013). Despite these advantages though patients find civil commitment coercive. Their freedom and treatment decisions are taken out of their control (Zervakis et al., 2007). This ultimately leads to a low measure of success. Slate, Buffington-Vollum and Johnson (2013) state this “Perceptions of coercion do not seem to dissipate much over time but instead hinder patients’ future encounter with treatment providers.” Research has even found that this process can be anti-therapeutic. In a study conducted by Katsakou and Priebe (2006) 50% of the patient involuntarily committed did not believe they required commitment. A similar percentage of participates found their commitment unjustified and one-third felt “no benefits or even felt harmed by their treatment years after their discharge.” (Katsakou & Priebe, 2006). If the patient does not feel as if they benefitted from this treatment or that this form of treatment was against their will and influences their decisions for medical care in the future, then it is safe t"
1166,"Hi, Really enjoyed your post! I agree that both types of involuntary commitment has major flaws. However, if I had to choose which is prone to be more successful I would probably choose outpatient. The outcome for patient's is higher compared to patient's who are committed involuntarily to hospitals. Every aspect of their lives are pretty much controlled by the facility so I can imagine that relationship between the hospital and the patient and not close. In fact, I would expect the patient to be reluctant going forward which would then hinder their hopes for treatment. I like how you brought up additional measures to success, I had also considered taking into account employment. I think another one I would consider is their integration into the community or peer/family socialization."
1167,"Hi Bethannie, Great post! I'm interested in which type of treatment you found met the appropriate measures of success? I came across similar pros and cons as you, the one con that I found from the text that was different was that sometimes for outpatient involuntary commitment, treatment is not always readily available. I think this is a major challenge this type of involuntary commitment would have to overcome because if there are not services for the patient then their hopes for progress cease. But the text also notes that one of the reasons that people avoid the use of outpatient commitment is because of the lack of funding so resources and awareness should be spread nationwide so that people with mental illness can receive the treatment they desperately need, inpatient or outpatient."
1168,"The arraignment/trial process would be the most difficult part for a PWMI in my opinion. It is at this stage that the defendant has the choice to plea guilty/ not guilty/no contest and negotiate a plea deal. Bargaining will need to be a skill used during the trial process so the defendant will need to work hand in hand with their lawyer to determine the best deal for them. A rational mind set must be present in both stages . If it is not, then the defendant would be incompetent to stand on trial because they would be deemed incompetent at the time of trial to make an informed decision (that is if the PWMI is having hallucinations/psychosis etc)  "
1169,I can't think of any positives to this situation other than hopefully PWMI will be released from the county jails (do to over crowding) and possibly they will get the help they need through clinics. Another scenario might be that treatment for PWMI will be better  because the population will be less compared to state. The challenges are that they are in the system where they should be with people who lack the knowledge and resources to give them the treatment they truly need.
1170,"I don't think there is anything ""unfair"" about a police officer being the first responder since that is their job. However, if I take into account what we learned from the lecture videos , there is much for the police officers to learn when interacting with a PWMI. Instead of acting, police officers should do as Officer Friend advised and that's talk with them and empathize because that is the best course of action to deescalate to situation. I still do not think it is ""unfair"" of the police officers that they are the first responders though because that is just how they are trained in the academy."
1171,"Around the country, an average of 8hrs of de-escalation training is acquired. Where as in St. Paul and Minneapolis it is becoming mandatory for law enforcement to go through CIT training. Law enforcements stigmatizing perspective's toward people with mental illnesses is decreasing and that's all because of the CIT training. The training provides police officers the skills they need to calm down a person who suffer from a disorder/substance abuse. They listen and emphasize with the person the de-escalate the scenario. By going through this training police officers are learning more about PWMI and realizing the best place for them is in treatment hospitals not jails/prisons for because of their disorder behaviors. "
1172," The goals and reasoning for the initiation of CIT are still valid arguments despite Taheri’s (2016) meta-analytic findings. The studies results were null when examining effectiveness on CIT arrests and officer use of force. Mixed results have been found though, for example, Ell-Mallakh et al. (2008) found that CIT officers used an increased level of force yet, Taheri’s (2016) findings were not significant. This leads me to my first suggestion, a more efficient evaluation system. More data needs to be collected on the effectiveness of the CIT model in order to decide if this model is appropriate for interacting with people who have mental illnesses in the community. Taheri (2016) also makes this suggestion and agree that this is needed so researchers can have a more accurate representation of the program. More tracked reports will help evaluate what is accurately failing within the program so we can improve and what is striving. This is then promote better outcomes for the community.    Suggestion two: I think every officer should be well trained in CIT. However, I think some might have a natural act for de-escalation skills and have experience with the mental health field. Those people who have these special skills and that do not have a stigmatizing attitudes toward people with mental illnesses should make up a police unit that caters to the needs of the mentally ill in the community. More knowledge into the mental health field and be provided alongside more intensive scenario trainings. Having a whole unit to specialize in this subject will hopefully open up resources to help improve the model. Like I said all other departments/units should still be required to take CIT training but the CIT unit should receive first accesses to “CIT-related” calls (Canada et al., 2012). Which leads me to my third suggestion.    Suggestion three: Police officers are called to a scene for a variety of reasons. They at times will not know what they are walking into so the academy trains them to be on alert always. I can imagine this would put a police officer on edge and cause them to be extra sensitive to their surroundings. This can then effect how they might react to a situation (which might cause excessive force). My third suggestion like Taheri (2016) mentions should be to mark what type of situation the officer is responding to by codes. There should be special codes though for sit"
1173,"Hi Georgette, In my post, I also had mentioned the inconsistencies and the insufficient amount of research on the subject matter of CIT. In order to determine an accurate result on the effectiveness of CIT, more data must be gathered. In theory, the concept of having that mental health professional in the field with the officer is a great idea but upon further review I can think of a few ways how this can be challenging. For instance, having multiple people there to interact with the PWMI might be overwhelming or confusing especially if the mental health professional is trying to guide the officer through a process or explain something to them. This is just a concern I had thought of but am interested in reading your thoughts.  "
1174,"Hi Serenity, Thank you for your post, I enjoyed reading your perspective. You made some great points as to why you think the CIT program should continue. I agree with your response and also noted in my post that because of the lack of reporting and the inconsistent findings from studies it's hard to get an accurate reading on the effectiveness of the CIT models. That is why it is important for the program to continue to that more reports can be collected and therefore more information can be gathered to determine a more accurate results. I'm curious if you had any other suggestions that might help increase effectiveness of the CIT model if it was to continue? For example, I mentioned creating CIT units so that there are designated police officers responding specifically to 911 calls where people with mental illnesses are involved. I noted that this might improve effectiveness because more training could then be provided to those officers which then could give them more knowledge on how to interact with a PWMI. This should then hopefully work towards their goals for CIT programs."
1175,"Perhaps the reason is because its the quickest. The jails probably have a long list of inmates they have to see and keep up with so for convenience since medication is suppose to be effective why not kill two birds with one stone, treat the inmates and get through as many patients/inmates as fast as possible. They might be quick to just force medication on patients instead of taking the time to try different treatment options like many hospitals do as well so the cost of medication might not be a thought on their mind just convenience."
1176,"After probably the 10th time being arrested and jailed, I can imagine it would begin to feel ""normal"" for people with mental illness. Which is the sad part. Especially since they are often prosecuted for misdemeanors such as break in to places for shelter or stealing items/food in order to survive. These crimes that they commit aren't violent crimes but crimes committed so they can have food and shelter. Frustration towards the criminal justice system could be present, they might feel stereotyped, discriminated, and targeted. Not knowing where they might end up also might be a worrisome thought in their mind. The inconsistency in their medical treatment could be overwhelming as well. The shuffling in and out of the jails, the poor treatment they might face while inside the jails and their lack of stability might be to much for them to handle.   "
1177,"If I had to choose, I would say inmates have few rights inside the jails. There is a lack of privacy for example but I understand why there is a need for that. Its for the safety of all parties involved that privacy is limited. I see the merits in a lot of the rules they have in jails/prisons however, I believe some rights should be loosened a little for certain situations. The inmates should have a right to human dignity, so under the eight amendment privacy such as going to the bathroom in some sort of privacy should be offered. I think inmates have few rights because the the rights that they do have are just there to protect them physically and emotionally other than that they are limited."
1178,"1. Antipsychotics: By measuring the effectiveness of a medication for someone with a mental illness the jails can keep track of which drugs are showing positive results within the inmates/patients in order to determine which drugs they should still recommend to people with a mental illness. 2. Solitary confinement: Often times, when an inmate is having an episode they are sent to solitary confinement to prevent them from hurting themselves or others. Measuring the length of time they are in there or even the results after coming out of solitary confinement can be measured to evaluate psychological or physical effects. 3. Deaths: This measure can determine if there is a high frequency of deaths for people with mental illnesses in a jail. By measuring for this we can determine the qualify or lack of quality the jails are providing for the inmates that have mental illnesses. This is an effective way of figuring out how to improve the system to prevent any maltreatment/wrongful deaths."
1179," Funding: At the county jails a major issue is funding, this is because they lack the capital to provide resources to PWMI (Torrey, Kennard, Eslinger, Lamb & Pavle, 2010). According to Slate, Buffington-Vollum and Johnson (2013), the jails can have a shortage or even have no available medication to treat mentally ill inmates since the costs for the treatments they need are expensive. Torrey, Kennard, Eslinger, Lamb and Pavle (2010) found that in Florida it costs $130 a day to house a PWMI verse the $80 a day for a non-mentally ill person. If jails were awarded funding for treatments, the prescription would be pricey and would not last long (Slate, Buffington-Vollum & Johnson, 2013). The inconsistency of treatment would ultimately cause negative effects for the mentally ill inmate because of the inconsistency (Slate, Buffington-Vollum & Johnson, 2013). Since this is the reality of care funding can offer for PWMI, this means the use of jails for the seriously mentally ill is inappropriate. Architecturally: jails do not offer enough space to evaluate and treat inmates with mental illnesses (Slate, Buffington-Vollum & Johnson, 2013). Since the jails do not have the ability to provide PWMI proper care, PWMI often have to stay at the county jail until beds at a psychiatric hospital opens up (Torrey, Kennard, Eslinger, Lamb & Pavle, 2010). This is a major reason why sentence lengths for PWMI are longer compared to others. This qualifies jails as inappropriate. Staffing is also limited and not experienced in the mental health field which further classifies them as inappropriate to treat inmates with mental illnesses (Slate, Buffington-Vollum & Johnson, 2013). Operationally: when inmates violate the rules or are seen as a risk to themselves or others then arrangements will be made to isolate the individual from the population. Mentally ill inmates have a higher track record of violations than inmates without mental illnesses (Torrey, Kennard, Eslinger, Lamb & Pavle, 2010). The greater part of the population of people in isolated confinement are PWMI. The effects of segregation are hallucinations, confusion, and aggression to name a few (Slate, Buffington-Vollum & Johnson, 2013). According to Torrey, Kennard, Eslinger, Lamb and Pavle (2010) following the day to day operations for a PWMI in the jail system can be difficult, especially when symptoms are heightened. For anyone, even a person without mental illness isolation"
1180,"Hi Jennifer, Really enjoyed your post. I agree with everything you said and I like how you noted that mentally ill people are prone to victimization. I had mentioned in my post about how jails with isolate PWMI so that they are not a treat to themselves or others but the text also makes a point in stating that segregation is also to ensure that PWMI are protected from being assaulted (Slate, Buffington-Vollum & Johnson, 2013). Do to the realignment policy changes that caused overcrowded ness in the jails this makes the likelihood of victimization even more of a possibility than before the changes came into effect of October 2011. The reality is that funding is the core issue. Without the funding, jails are limited in the care they can provide for the inmates whether they have mental illnesses or not. Restricted funding effects the treatment, the facility accommodations and the day to day operations the county jails provide for PWMI."
1181,"Hi Asia, Thanks for your perspective I enjoyed reading your post. I agree with you have the facilities and care the justice system provides PWMI in the jails is inappropriate and needs major improvements. If more funding was offered to the jails better/more appropriate accommodations would be provided for PWMI, not superior to hospitals but more acceptable compared to how it is now. It is a shame and a real tragedy what the Sheriff stated. Not providing PWMI the proper treatments they need and the space/architectural resources in the jails is a violation of their eight amendment rights. I'm interested in reading more on what you think of the facilities/the jails housing for PWMI. You touched on a lot of the lack of funding and resources/ operational constraints but what are your thoughts on let's say the beds or the space offered to treat PWMI in the fails?"
1182,I think it is fair because nothing in life can really be 100% accurate. The risk assessment tools gather statistical data to determine the standard for risk. It's there to provide professionals a guide but ultimately it is not there to make the final decision. Professionals need to also do investigative work to make a decision on risk.
1183,"I don't think the set up for supervision and treatment for people with mental illness is well executed. The video mentioned how there were 400,000 people under probation supervision. The people with mental illness might need that extra support from their probation officer but somehow that seems very unlikely that that will occur. They may try all they can to help but in the end they have so many charges they need to see that I'm sure people slip through the cracks. Check ins might be missed and having that resource there might not be that reliable. I feel like they are equal and I say that because they both have their faults so it's hard to decide which one is the lesser evil. If I had to choose though I would go with probation. They are able to provide that supervision and treatment a lot better because jails aren't really there to guide inmates and treatments will absolutely provide people with mental illness a lot of help compared to is they were in the jails. There are more resources made available outside of the jails."
1184,"I think the pros outweigh the negatives in mental health court. The lady in the video mentioned how she was going to lose her social security and that can be the consequences of this type of court however, I do think this type of court can do so much for people with mental illnesses. It will reduce the rates of criminalization for people with mental illness which is a positive because one they will get the treatment they truly need instead of jail time and two it will prevent any risks they are prone to while in jail. For example, mentally ill people are more likely to be victimized in jail compared to others, the resources in jails are lacking and therefore could have some serious affects on them. Unlike the jails, these homes or programs they are being enrolled in as part of their probation for the mental health courts will be able to support them more."
1185,"I do not think they would be receptive to the RNR approach. The approach would want to focus on high risk mentally ill offenders. In my mind, I'm perceiving high-risk to be violent. If that is an example of what they would consider high risk then I think that would eliminate a lot of people from this model since mentally ill people are not commonly violent. Another factor that could be a concern with PWMI is substance abuse. PWMI often times have substance abuse problems so in addition to recidivism this would be a factor and homelessness as well."
1186," Something new needed to be developed in order to deter PWMI from being swept into the criminal justice system. That what inspired the RNR Model from being created. The RNR Model may not have much data to show that the model is successful, there was a study conducted by Skeem, Polaschek, and Manchak in 2009 that found progress exhibited decreased violence and antisocial behaviors among high risk and psychiatric patient when exposed to intensive treatment. Even though the model does not have much evidence to support its treatment I think it worth initiating a trial intervention. Its more than just treating a persons mental illness, it’s treating those risk factors that lead mentally ill people to criminal behavior (Skeem, Steadman, & Manchak, 2015). As we have learned through out this quarter in our lectures and readings, mentally ill people are not commonly violent like the public perceives them to be (Slate, Buffinton-Vollum, & Johnson, 2013). They also are not arrested majority of the time because of acts of aggression. The mentally ill inmates who make up the jails in Cook County according to Sheriff Tom Dart the man in charge of the jail there explains they majority were arrested for misdemeanor crimes such as trespassing or steal; their crimes were committed in order to survive on the streets (Grzanich, 2013). So based on all this information treating the persons risk behaviors like the RNR Models goal would be beneficial to reduce recidivism in my opinion.  Gathering what I learned from Skeem, Steadman, and Manchak (2015) the advantage of the RNR Model is that it is tailored towards the individual. It assesses the mentally ill person and determines their risks based on their history then factors in indicators such as antisocial personalities and substance abuse to then determine the best course of treatment for the individual. Everyone is different so what’s nice about this model; the treatment is shaped to fit the individual on probation in order for them to achieve a successful outcome. This model doesn’t even have to be just for people with mental illness, it can be generalized to fit the needs of everyone on probation which is why I would guide/recommend a chief probation officer into using this risk-need-responsivity model for supervising mental illness on probation.      References:  Grzanich, S. (2013, September 30). Jails are th"
1187,"Hi Wendy, I liked your thought on combining the RNR model and the CBT programs. The RNR model has the acceptance of people but lack of supportive data; CBT programs have the evidence that shows reduced recidivism. For example Sachs and colleagues (2004), found that 16% of participants returned to prison compared to 33% who were enrolled in the psychiatric treatment group. I thought even though the RNR model lacks the empirical evidence to support effectiveness of the model I think the foundation is there. Perhaps merging the two interventions could make the models stronger and decrease the rate of recidivism while still tending to the needs of mentally ill people. I noted in my post that I would guide the probation officer into using the RNR Model because I liked how it took into account the the risk indicator for that person that meant to me that it molded the treatment to the individual instead of categorizing everyone into one box and treating them the same. If the probation officer used this model they could find what motivates that mentally ill person in order to keep them committed to their treatment and staying out of the justice system."
1188,"Hi Elise, Great post! Definitely more research need to be done to ensure both symptoms and recidivism are reduced. I was in the support of the RNR model because I liked their approach on how they brainstormed to decrease recidivism for PWMI. They thought by targeting the criminal behaviors (antisocial traits and substance abuse etc) among high risk offenders that could result in fewer individuals returning to jail (Skeem et al., 2015). However, one of of the negatives of the RNR Model/ focus on correctional services does not show enough development compared to psychiatric services (Skeem et al., 2015). It's important how you mentioned being flexible to mistakes. A probation officer in the 6-1 video lecture commented on how if an individual relapses with drugs for example they are automatically sent to jail. The probation officers work with the individual to get them back on the right track. Like you say a balance is needed in order to supervise."
1189,"Prison is stressful for anyone. Add in that you have a mental illness, I can imagine emotions would be heightened. Their ability to do or go where ever they want is now restricted in prison so this might set off an individual with mental illness. The conditions are not suitable for PWMI because they lack the staff and knowledge to interact with them, equipment to house, and treatments to alleviate the symptoms of their condition. The correction officers in the video for example do not know how to interact or are not educated in the mental health field so because of this lack of knowledge they act aggressively towards the individual to get him out of the cell. There were like 5 correction officers to one person, the trauma of that would for sure aggravate the condition of persons with mental illness."
1190,"I do not think so and its not because I don't think people with mental illness will not ever get better but I think it's an illness that has it's ups and downs. There are going to be good days and bad days even with treatment. Plus the individual won't be in prison forever, eventually they will get out so if the person does not have access to treatment outside of prison their symptoms of their illness will likely display again. I do not think prisons even have all the proper resources available to treat treat a person with mental illness so it would be difficult to truly rehabilitate prisoners with mental illnesses."
1191,"The disadvantages far outweigh the advantages in my opinion. Based on the video,  isolation can lead to aggression/violent thoughts and emotional/physical distress. These are just a few of the negatives of solitary confinement. Being locked up like that is bound to take a toll on an individuals physical and mental state. While in solitary confinement their nutrition is not going to be a concern and neither is physical activity for the prisons. Their concern is for maintaining prison order. However, I do not see how one person can cause so much disruption that they need to be sent to confinement. The inmate could possibly come out being being more of a concern than before because of the effects of solitary confinement. The only advantage I see from solitary confinement is perhaps for violent incidences confinement could be used as a room for people to calm down in but not for a long time. It wouldn't be for punishment just a tool to ensure all parties are kept safe from one another.  "
1192,"I am fine with my taxes being used to help mentally ill inmates, it is money well spent to provide them the services/treatments they desperately need. Our taxes are being used to fund inmates already so might as well use it to fund a population that really needs it. However, it is upsetting to know that had their funding been budgeted and spent accordingly more money wouldn't have been needed. So going forward I think there should be a committee or an approval from the state or county or someone of a higher position to make sure funding is going towards resources that are required to keep them within regulation at least since that is what they are claiming the money is needing to be used for. "
1193,"      Yes, I do believe PWMI should receive more resources than other inmates not suffering from mental illness. The amount of classified “severe” inmates in Florida Department of Corrections (n.d.) from their 2005-2006 report was seen to have doubled in size. They went from 402 to 812 seriously mentally ill inmates. The reality is and what we have been learning this quarter is that prisons and jails are packed with mentally ill inmates who are constantly being shuffled in and out of the correctional system (Slate, Buffington-Vollum & Johnson, 2013). More needs to be done to put an end to this cycle and I believe that can be done if more resources were offered to PWMI within the prisons. They deserve the additional funding because as we learned in Lecture 7-4 the minimum requirements for basis needs for PWMI are not even being met. A factor could be that they didn’t budget well enough however regardless jails and prisons are not capable of controlling PWMI appropriately. The prisons and jails solutions are to put PWMI in solitary confinement when they disrupt the order of prison (Slate, Buffington-Vollum & Johnson, 2013). The inmates symptoms of their mental illness are not capable of controlling or even understanding the rules (Slate, Buffington-Vollum & Johnson, 2013). So they are often times going to be sent to solitary confinement which has actually shown negative consequences. For example, PWMI are found to come out more aggressive than when they went into solitary confinement (Slate, Buffington-Vollum & Johnson, 2013). Therefore more resources should be allocated to properly controlling PWMI. This will then meet the need to keep inmates and staff safe while still providing treatment for the mentally ill population. This quote by Ball (2010) furthermore sums up why it’s important to change and add additional resources for PWMI, “Prisons fail to adequately screen inmates for mental illness during intake. They fail to offer special programming or housing, they often fail to provide basis treatment, and they fail to address special needs upon release. The result is that mentally ill prisoners get sicker, stay longer, suffer more, and wind up back in prison soon after their release” (p. 5 ).       Given the fact that prisons are now becoming the new “asylum” (American Psychiatric Association, 2004; Fellner, 2006; Treatment Advocacy Center, 2007) more staffing should be made available to accommodate the increa"
1194,"Hi Asia, Really enjoyed reading your perspective. I wanted to add that according to Toch & Adams (1986), not only are they at risk for being victimized but they also pose a treat to the prison population. The study found that mentally ill inmates tend to commit assaults and other violent acts upon others inside prison. Therefore, I think your idea for isolating the mentally ill and non-mentally ill could be beneficial for the two populations. I am curious, I see the benefits separation would have (e.g. inmate safety) however,  how would the separation keep staff safe? And would you elaborate on how separation would save on costs? I liked your idea on including CIT training for correctional officers. I would agree that that would be very helpful to have that technique used inside prisons."
1195,"I completely agree with your statement on how if we would to decrease the reoffending rate then costs will go down because the number of housing and treatment for mentally ill inmates will then go down. It's like a domino effect, if we work on one thing everything else will follow. Not allocating the appropriate resources/funds only adds to the problems within the prisons (e.g. overcrowded ness). The additional resources will minimize the symptoms of their illnesses which will then lead to staff and inmate safety and decrease sentencing lengths. According the the Human Rights Watch (2003), a frequent dilemma in in prisons for mental health care is the lack of staff, inadequate screenings and records of mentally ill inmates. That is why I think your recommendation to conduct an early screening assessment is a great idea. It will determine a treatment plan for that inmate. Not every one is the same so the information they gather from the assessment will determine what safety precautions and treatments the individual needs. I wrote that additional experience/educated staff is needed. I think the extra hands provided will be able to treat more inmates and the more hands to more people to be able to handle the mentally ill inmates in case any incidents occur. This would also include correctional officers. Having Correctional Crisis Intervention Teams within the prisons is something I think would also be needed and that I would include under additional staffing. Since we learned CIT has been linked to a reduction of injuries for both mentally ill individuals and police (Slate, Buffington-Vollum & Johnson, 2013) this would meet the goal of inmate and staff safety."
1196,"I would be happy that my taxes are being used to construct a new hospital for mentally ill patients. With a new facility, that means better resources will be accessible to patients. They explained in the video that everything will be state of the art, which will provide patients with new technology and a variety of treatment plans. For example, the lady in the video mentioned that patients could join in group therapies and provide support for one another. This form of treatment was not available in order facilities but now with the new facility these advancements will be be able to provide a more successful outcome for its patients."
1197,"I do not think the insanity defense is a ""Get out of Jail Free"" card because if they are found not guilty by reason of insanity then they are not released back into the community to go about their same life. They are sent to a psychiatric hospital to get treatment for their mental illness. And if their hope for using the defense is to get an easy sentencing/punishment they aren't going to get it at a psychiatric hospital. Their experience there is not going to be as pleasant as they are imagining also a short sentencing is most likely not going to happen. They are now entering the mental health system so they have to go through those channels in order to be released which is very difficult. "
1198,"If funding wasn't an issue, hiring more and experienced staff would be what's best in order to handle mentally ill patients. The extra staffing would also be able to ensure staff safety. They would no longer have to rely on additional help from an unqualified staff member whose position is unrelated to nursing. By doing so, it will keep the patients safe too.  Maybe instead of hiring extra nurses security should be hired. I am not sure if the different position will help cut costs at all but if it does they can be in charge of protecting the staff and the staff can be in charge of patient safety and providing them their treatment. In the end leaving the staff vulnerable to attacks is not safe for the staff as well as for the patient. At the very least the hospitals need to put a protocol in place, which states that when interacting with a patient who is mentally ill, a minimum of two nurses or two educated staff members need to be present before proceeding. Also the video mentioned that patients had the ability to walk about as they pleased in the hospitals. A suggestion might be to restrict where they can go or limit their time."
1199,"I do not have anything against the use of this treatment. It sounded extreme initially but every treatment kind of does when its first introduced. I think all that matters is if the patients are safe and if they are then as long as the treatment works for them then I do not see a problem with this experimental treatment. I might have one concern but that's only do to the fact that it is brain surgery and the patients are awake during the procedure. However, surgery is always going to be risky no matter the type and patients are aware of this going in. It sounds like the doctors have good evidence to believe this treatment will be a success so that is great for patients like Edith who have tried medication and have found no relief."
1200," According to Fisher et al. (2000), general hospitals prefer not to accept the following patients: “…people who pose a serious risk of violence toward others, appear difficult to discharge, or display inappropriate sexual or other problematic behavior that would place other patients or staff at risk” (as seen in Fisher, Geller, & Pandiani, 2009, pp. 678). As we learned from this weeks Lecture 3, majority of the patients in state hospitals (90%) are “forensic patients.” These “forensic patients” consist of people who are not competent to stand on trial, Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity, CDCR, MDO, and lastly SVP’s who were civically committed. These populations have histories of those problematic behaviors that the general hospital do not want to handle but state hospitals take them in (Fisher, Geller, & Pandiani, 2009). I think the state hospitals caring for those populations that others reject is an appropriate role because it gives this population a place to receive proper care for their symptoms of mental illness. State hospitals are willing to handle patients that come from the criminal justice system so I would consider that an appropriate role since no one else is willing to help for example, general hospitals.  No I do not believe state hospitals should be used exclusively for forensic patients. The Department of State Hospitals reported a 10% population comprised of non-forensic patients (Lecture 3). That is already not a lot of room left over to treat people from the public. If anything the state hospitals should make more room for this population. Exclusively reserving space for the criminal justice system eliminates opportunities for non-mentally ill patients to be civilly committed. I do not see the advantages of narrowing the range of patients. Especially since there are a lot of challenges that involve housing forensic patients. Fisher, Geller, and Pandiani (2009) mentions that there are consequences such as state hospital operations and financing that come from serving this population. So then having the whole state hospital resourced only to treat forensic patients would increase the costs for treatment for the state hospitals. The state hospitals would be in charge of paying for the treatment of patients who come from the criminal justice system (Fisher, Geller, & Pandiani, 2009). Another challenge addressed in the article is long stay or difficult-to-discharge patients. Undertaking these populati"
1201,"Hi Sayla, I definitely agree with you that the hospitals should treat a wide range of patients (e.g. forensic patients and civilly committed patients). Therefore, that's why I argued in my post that the state hospitals should not allocate resources exclusive to the forensic patients population. Fisher, Geller and Pandiani (2009) explained how with acceptance of these populations comes challenges such as discharging and funding. It sounds like you favor the use of state hospitals for more than just forensic patients is this correct? If so, did you find any consequences that might come from treating forensic patients and that's why state hospitals should be opened up to a variety of other populations? Or did you decline exclusiveness because you believed treatment should be extended to everyone? "
1202,"Hi Serenity, I enjoyed reading your post. I completely agree with you that the state hospitals should not be exclusively to forensic patients because it doesn't leave opportunities for non-forensic patients to seek treatment. I think your idea of separating the two populations is a great idea. I noted in my post that the states appropriate role is that they are serving forensic patients since places like general hospitals are against treating them (Fisher, Geller, & Pandiani, 2009). So I agree that state hospital should treat this population since they have the resources and capability to handle the challenges that come with the symptoms of their mental illnesses. However, according to Fisher, Geller, and Pandiani (2009) ""...the role of state hospitals has been one of managing populations deemed inappropriate for other settings"" (pp.679).  This can include non-forensic patients. This population also requires so much assistance and I don't believe forensic patients should be taken priority over them. They are both important populations and deserve an equal amount of care from state hospitals. Therefore, state hospitals should not elusively provide treatment to forensic patients within the criminal justice system. "
1203,"Based on the video between Jim Parsons and Richard G. Dudley, I understood the goal behind why data sharing was important and how the Criminal Justice and Mental Health systems are linked. However, Parsons explained that the link between the two systems are not strong and that there are barriers that pose challenges. For example, when a PWMI is released what would be beneficial is for agencies to be in contact so that once an inmate is released from jail/prison they have someone from the mental health system to get in contact with and help them in the transition and provide them with resources to continue treatment in the community. I think it should all start with the criminal justice system. Once an individual is arrested, the first thing that should occur is an assessment of the individuals alongside when police book/process them in order to identify PWMI's needs. Sadly, as Parsons describes is not the criminal justices top priority. If protocols were set in place to ensure that this is done and police were educated on the importance of this protocol then that could lead to a better relationship between them and the mental health system."
1204,"I think the first thing that stood out to me was how they tailored the conversation to make Rick comfortable. I think often police are trained to take control of the situation and that they are the ones calling the shots but when Rick started feeling agitated when the first officer introduced himself he took a step back and didn't they to push Rick or dominate over Rick instead the second officer came in and tried to calm Rick down. I then notice while the second officer was talking to Rick the first officer took away the medication that was laid out on the kitchen counter. They talked with Rick to determine what Rick took and how much of it he took. They communicated to Rick that they wanted to provide him with help instead of worrying about arresting him. They listed other resources Rick can contact if he ever felt like he needed help. They were knowledgable on other services which is something I think is essential. What we learned from the first lecture is often times systems don't have that great of communication between one another. Often times the criminal justice system is more concerned with arrests and getting a suspect through the process that the individuals treatment needs might not be their top priority. But in the video what they did was something different, after they dealt with Rick and provided him with the help he needed they contacted CAN HELP so that they can come out to the scene. "
1205,"I think there are so many things on the departments of corrections plate that they need to govern over that they are to busy or even they might be unaware of the issues that they need to improve on. If they have no knowledge that something is no broken then they have no reason to provoke a change, that would just be adding additional work to themselves. They already have to deal with the issues of overcrowded ness so they are probably trying to work on one issue at a time unless they are taken to court and are force to make improvements. Also, they may have barriers that are preventing them from making the appropriate changes (e.g. funding). "
1206,"The challenges that I can think of is when the DOS might think the inmate is trying to be deceptive about their mental illness. That might cause some interferences which will impact the mental health workers. Also, another challenge I can think of is how the correctional environment might set back the progress of treatment or create issues for the mentaIly ill inmate (e.g. solitary confinement and overcrowding). By cross-training with correctional agencies/staff, I think both parties will be able to get an understanding and more knowledge/understanding to the importance of resources that should be offered to inmates with mental illness. Cross-training will also provide opportunities for both the mental health system and correctional system to communicate more effectively. A better communicative relationship is beneficial for inmates in the end."
1207," The Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) Model is by far the most effective training, in my opinion, we have learned about thus far for criminal justice and mental health professionals. There are many benefits to the criminal justice professionals being trained in this model and for people who suffer from a mental illness. As Watson and Fulambarker (2012) explains, “The primary goals of the model are to increase safety in encounters and when appropriate, divert persons with mental illnesses from the criminal justice system to mental health treatment” (pp. 2). The model’s goal benefits PWMI by reducing their arrest rates (Dupont & Cochran, 2000) and increasing their opportunities for treatment. One of the skills that are taught to these officers, in order to work towards that goal, is de-escalations techniques (Watson & Fulambarker, 2012). This sets them apart from other officers not trained in the CIT Model because they talk thru what’s wrong with the mentally ill individual to help calm them down and convince the PWMI to seek professional help. In that instance, they are the listeners where as other officers are usually trained to be in control of the situation. However, research has found that officers not trained in de-escalation techniques escalated the situation when interacting with a mentally ill person (Watson & Fulambarker, 2012). CIT benefits PWMI by allowing them someone they can talk to openly without worrying about incarceration.  The CIT Model for mental health professionals help bridge the gap between the two systems (i.e. MH system & CJ system). Opening up the channels of communication can help to resolve the frustrations each system has against one another. This will then create better relationships/provoke confidence in the others competence which is beneficial for the mentally ill person. For example, a mental health professional will be able to refer their clients to 911 and feel confident doing so (Watson & Fulambarker, 2012). Mental health professionals are often grouped in with criminal justice professionals for the training process of CIT (Watson & Fulambarker, 2012). So the information they learn from those trainings (e.g. de-escalation techniques, signs and symptoms for PWMI, treatment for mental illnesses and legal issues etc) allow them to counsel the best course of action for individuals and their families (Watson & Fulambarker, 2012)."
1208,"Hi Nani, Definitely agree with you! One thing I would mention too is how it provokes safety for all parties involved. In a study conducted by Skeem and Bibeau (2008), 15% of ""high violence risk"" cases resulted in CIT officers having to use force with PWMI (As cited in Watson & Fulambarker, 2012, pp.5). In those situations though force had a low level of lethalness (SKeem & Bibeau, 2008). The benefit of criminal justice professionals learning the CIT Model for mentally ill individuals is that less force is typically used compared to officers not trained in the CIT Model (Morabito, Kerr, Watson, Draine, & Angell, 2012). This is essential training because it leads to decreased reports of injury for people who suffer from mental illnesses and officers (Hanafi, Bahora, Demir, & Compton, 2008). Enjoyed reading your post!"
1209,"Hi Vivian, I agree with your recommendation that the CIT Model should be mandatory and in every jurisdiction because of the many benefits (e.g. reduced numbers of injuries, decreased incarceration for pwmi, and increased amount of pwmi getting treatment) (Watson & Fulambarker, 2012). Sadly, there are only around 1,000 of these programs initiated (CIT International, 2011). According to Compton et al. (2010) and Compton et al. (2011), the implemented CIT programs aren't even fully developed, this is in order to tailer to program to the jurisdiction (Watson & Fulambarker, 2012). If this limitation continues do you have an opinion on at least where you would want these programs to continue or where you think the programs should move too? For example, a jurisdiction with high rates of police/mentally ill individuals deaths."
1210,Maybe because they think the violent offenders pose a high risk. The might think it is to dangerous and would rather focus on the population of non-violent mentally ill offenders. Prioritizing that population first might be their goal at the moment. Just because the violent offenders are at a higher risk doesn't mean the jails/ prisons are the appropriate place for them. They should still fall under the diversion program but perhaps sent to a specialize and experience facility that is capable of working with this population. 
1211,I think they might be the same to implement evidence-based practices. I say that because I do not think any of the two systems will initiate a program unless it has evidence to support the effectiveness of  the program. They would just be wasting money/resources and risking the safety of staff and patients/inmates if the program did not pan out.
1212,"It would be beneficial for others to realize that having a mental illness doesn't mean you have to act a certain way or look a certain way. For example, live on the streets and act out aggressively/violent. The symptoms of their mental illness are not who the individual is and by participating or even just by witnessing the effects of peer mentoring one can get a sense of what its truly like to live with mental illness. They might also be able to educate others on the reality of mental illness."
1213,"I would hope that by integrating the MH and Substance Abuse Model the justice system will be open minded regarding this population. As it is now with just mental illness, some law enforcement perceive people with mental illness as faking an illness. With individuals who have co-occurring disorders, my hope is that the model will educate that someone can have both substance abuse issues as well as a mental illness so one should not jump to conclusions and write off someone as having just a drug addiction for example. That person should still be assessed and treated. By integrating the model, I would hope that the justice system will adapt their principles and environment to better fit individuals with co-occurring disorders. "
1214,"Hi everyone! My name is Gabriela Bayol and I'm from San Francisco, California. I graduated from San Francisco State University with my BA in Psychology with a minor in Criminal Justice. I was really interested in the intersection between the two and felt I still had lots to learn! When I saw this program, it seemed like a perfect fit. I used to work for the SF Adult Probation Department helping individuals get their high school diplomas or GEDs. Now, I currently work for SF Court Appointed Special Advocates as their Juvenile Justice Coordinator and Case Supervisor. In this position, I supervise volunteers who are court appointed advocates to a youth or non minor dependent in the dependency system. I also specialize in the cases involving juvenile justice. Through my work, I often supervises cases where mental health services are being provided or requested. I also have cases where untreated mental health issues or substance misuse are a reason a child came into care.I hope to leave this class with a better understanding of the intersection between the justice system, legal system, and mental health. I also hope to hear from other students about their insights and experiences with this topic.  "
1215,There are many things that could have prevented Timothy Souders from dying in prison. The guards should have taken the issue that he was not drinking water seriously and reported that there was a medical problem. The prison should have had a psychiatrist on duty to address mental health emergency and issues.The prison should have used humane methods of behavior correction. It seems as if Michigan law regarding prison didn't allow for punitive restraints but the guards used that method anyway. There should have been someone overseeing that these laws and regulations were being followed. This story goes to show the dangers and harm that using the prison system as the US's mental health system is.  
1216,"Hi Stephen, I really enjoyed reading your response and agree completely. It saddens and maddens me that this incident, and others like it, are seemingly so preventable. For the group of officers to turn a blind eye and ignore the fact that Timothy was suffering and dying seems hard to believe, but in reality is not extremely uncommon. I think in order to fix this system, the criminal justice and mental health systems need to be separate or we at least need to acknowledge that people in the criminal justice system with mental illness need different resources and support than those who do not.  "
1217,"Non-medical considerations have made it harder for society to accept and understand mental illness. These non-medical considerations allow people to create excuses to shun or hide away persons with mental illness. If the consensus in a group of people is that mental illness is caused by evil spirits for example, not only would that immediately drive away any thought of treatment or care, but it would also continue to plant the idea that people with mental illness are dangerous, scary, and overall bad. "
1218,"Hi Nani,  I do agree that treatment and care are more humanistic today, I have to disagree that non-medical considerations helped it get there. My take is that once society started widely accepting mental health and mental illness as a medical issue, that is when treatment and care truly became accessible and, to your point, human. Those are just some of my thoughts! Although, I hope that I am fully understanding the question that is being posed. "
1219,"In terms of gun violence, I do not think the benefits of a national registry of mentally ill persons outweigh the costs. Only 3%-5% of violent offenses are committed by persons with mental illness, so there is no strong data to back up the need for such a registry. Also, I think it is discriminatory in a sense. People with mental illness can seek treatment and live a successful and normal (for lack of a better word) life and should not have to be subject to a registry. I also think creating a registry would further stigmatize mental illness which is something that so many live with every day. I think something like that could also create a reason for people to avoid seeking help. If someone knew they would be put on a registry for potentially being diagnosed with a mental illness, they may want to avoid that problem altogether and miss out on treatment or medication that could better their lives. "
1220,"Hi Lisa,  I loved reading your response! I liked your point about the money being better spent on educating people about PWMI. I agree. I also think it can be spent on educating about gun violence. I also agree this kind of registry would further stigmatize mental illness. I also think it would turn people away from seeking treatment. I also worry that something like this is a slippery slope. "
1221,"I think the most important problem to ""fix"" is the community resources and support services for people with mental illness. I think by creating more spaces in a community for PWMI to seek treatment and support, we can also simultaneously help de-stigmatize mental illness. Through more community sites for PWMI, maybe that can help educate more people on the reality of mental illness. If there aren't better programs created in the community, I fear that the criminal justice system will remain the US's largest mental health care system."
1222,"Hi Jennifer,  I enjoyed reading your response! I really like your idea around education because I do agree that people have to be aware of the realities of mental illness and understand that the media  portrays PWMI in a bad light. Your point about the media personnel being better informed got me thinking about current celebrities or people with a platform. Do you think that through the openness of certain people in the public eye, it is helped de-stigmatize mental illness? That is not nearly educated enough, I'm just hoping that we are at least moving toward that. "
1223,"Mental Illness has been viewed very differently throughout the centuries. From believing someone with mental illness is possessed by demons, to viewing PWMI as people who need to be taken care of. There have been many views and I think historically people were confused and unaware of the realities of mental illness. People did not understand what mental illness was and therefore were fearful and maybe had trouble believing the legitimacy of a mental illness. I think there were times when society viewed PWMI as unable to be self-determinate. This led to PWMI being locked away and shunned to the corners of society. I think we still struggle with the idea of considering them full fledged members of society. With 5150s, 5250s etc., we are definitely implying as society that we do not trust certain people with mental illnesses to take care of themselves or to be left to their own devices. I do understand and appreciate that these laws are put into place to keep PWMI safe and those around them safe as well. I think we are trying to strike a balance between protecting PWMI and the public, and allowing PWMI to live a full and successful life without legal intervention.  I do think the biggest issue now, is finding a way to help provide support and necessary treatment for PWMI because the criminal justice system as the new mental health system is clearly not the solution. "
1224,"Hi Briana,  I loved how you broke down the different beliefs and treatments for PWMI throughout history. It always shocks me the kinds of ""treatments"" that were done. Although, it is clear that those kinds of treatments and beliefs were born from fear, misunderstanding, and lack of knowledge on the realities of mental illness. I think we still absolutely struggle with the ""us"" and ""them"" idea today. Like your last point, I do agree that they criminal justice system has become the new mental health system. The biggest problem with this is the fact that the criminal justice system is not set up and does not have the proper means to treat people with mental illness. So, this becomes very harmful for the wellbeing of PWMI. There needs to be more community based programs that are equipped to treat PWMI because as long as PWMI keep funneling into the justice system, they will not receive proper treatment and therefore not given a chance to be a successful member of society. "
1225,"Hi Alyse,  Great post! I really enjoyed your description of the Ancient Civilization period and the idea around what a registry could mean today. I, too, agree that we must change the way society views PWMI. If society were to focus on bringing PWMI and treating them within families and communities, they have the opportunity to feel support and understanding from society. I have read about cultures that have completely different views around PWMI and the cultures that protect and bring in PWMI, give PWMI an opportunity to not only be viewed, but also  be full-fledged members of society. The us and them attitude towards PWMI will never benefit anyone in the long run. Like you noted, if a quarter of the entire population are persons with mental illness, we need to create a mental health system that works and de-stigmatizes PWMI. "
1226,"In order to bring an end to stigma of mental illness, a president can continue a conversation about it. The president has the power to normalize it by expressing his or her understanding that mental illness is something that many many people live with and are treated for every day. The president can also ensure funding for mental health clinics and support serves in the community. It would also be important to implement policies that reflect the idea that PWMI have rights and are protected citizens. In the above video, Obama says, ""we whisper about mental health issues."" This is a powerful statement that exemplifies that idea that mental illness is a secret and shouldn't be discussed and as a long as the president discusses mental health and makes it clear that PWMI are not alone, this can help end the stigma of mental illness. "
1227,"Hi Amber,  I enjoyed reading your response! I work in a field where there are lot of mental health professionals who are spread so thin, so I loved your idea about increasing the income of those jobs. I agree that the president can continue the conversation but also needs to support PWMI financially and ensure there are mental health treatment programs for  everyone. "
1228,"The movement toward reducing benefits for mental health care says that policymakers feel mental health care is not as ""worthy"" as other kinds of health care. Further, this movement says that policymakers are not concerned about the mental health of people living with low incomes or below the poverty line. By reducing these benefits, it exemplifies a thought process that mental health is not a priority and is not as important as other health care. Also, if these benefits are taken away, for example, Medicaid, then many people who receive that kind of funding will be option less and not have the resources or opportunities for mental health treatment. "
1229,Mental health treatment for active military and veterans should be similar to those who are not in the military or a veteran but I think they should be monitored more closely and that it is ensured they are also receiving therapeutic services along with the prescribed medication. Active military and veterans should have access to the necessary medication and therapy to cope and treat the complexities of PTSD. I would recommend this group take medication but with the realities of their job or past being taken into consideration. 
1230,"I think society should be allowed to ""step in"" and mandate treatment only when the person's behavior is causing a threat to themselves or others. Further, it may be appropriate in some cases to try and help a PWMI acknowledge that they are ill in order to help them seek treatment, but I think as long as the person is not posing a danger, then they should be allowed the liberty to deny treatment. I believe this to be the appropriate way because we need to tread carefully and ensure that PWMI are given proper rights but also protecting them and others if it gets to that point. "
1231,"Teaching and curricula should combat stigma by containing informative and honest information about mental health. In elementary and middle school, there is a good chance that some of the youth in that age range are dealing with mental illness in some capacity. Maybe they themselves are having thoughts or behaviors that they cannot understand or control or maybe there parents or family members are experiencing mental health issues. Regardless of a youth's individual experience with mental illness, teachers should have a responsibility to introduce and shed some light on what mental health is. For elementary and middle school aged children, the curriculum could include definitions and explanations of mental health. I think simply introducing the subject and creating a space where young people can have a conversation and ask questions can have a powerful way of combating stigma.  In high school, I think the teaching and curricula can become more robust and dive deeper into the realities of mental health and mental illness. When I was in high school, I knew 4 students who committed suicide. After we lost each of these students, the school would come together and offer support services and classes about depression and suicide and I couldn't help but wonder if anything could have been different if we brought up the topic of mental health before we lost anyone. I think combatting stigma can help save lives and to do that, we have to talk about it. We have to let young people know that  they are not alone in facing mental illness and that we should all understand the importance of strong mental health. "
1232,"Hi Alyse,  I really enjoyed the specificity and thought in your curriculum. When you were describing the curriculum for elementary school kids, what grade would that begin? To your point, I thought about how important it is too debunk myths of mental illness, but I think the first place to start is describing what it is. Further, I think teaching an idea of what mental health is and the importance of it can help set the foundation of curiosity rather than fear when beginning to talk about mental health and mental illness. I also really like your point about teaching high schoolers about substance abuse and mental illness with emphasis that they are not alone and can find support when they need it. "
1233,"Hi Denise, I loved your post. Your idea about the story for young people was really great and I see how that can be a positive way to teach about mental health. I was also struck by your child psychologist idea. That is something I did not think about but is a wonderful idea. To have a professional that knows how to properly answer the questions and likely de-stigmatize the subject of mental illness even more, would be really beneficial. I was also really impressed by your idea about bringing a speaker who has a mental illness into a class to help the students understand the truth about mental illness and mental health. I pointed out in my post by that it is likely that many of these students have experience with mental illness whether it is them or their family members, so this would be a great way to help them understand. "
1234,"Those testing an individual's mental health and whether or not they should be civilly committed strives to have 100% of both of sensitivity and specificity, I'm sure. But, that being said, I think society has more concern over false negatives than false positives. It seems society may believe it is better to have someone who is not mentally ill civically committed rather than risk someone who is mentally ill and could cue dangerous be out left to their own devices. I think the risks may be greater to falsely civilly commit someone, that being said, it must be weighed against the risk on society if someone who is mentally ill and may hurt themselves or others. "
1235,"I think that involuntary commitment of sex offenders after they complete their sentences is a bad idea because it is a violation of their rights. If they serve their time in the criminal justice system they should be granted the ability and opportunity to seek more therapeutic help if they would like that, but I do not think it right to then essentially lock them up again. The video above demonstrated the condition of these hospitals and it seems awfully close to a prison setting. If that were different and the focus was truly on helping and offering therapeutic services to offenders, then maybe my answer would change but at this point, I believe to lock them up against their will in a setting that looks and feels like prison, is a violation and is a second punishment once they served their time already.  "
1236,"I would argue that inpatient commitment is the larger reach of state authority into an individual's liberty. Although, if both inpatient or outpatient commitment are involuntary, it seems they should both be considered a reach of state authority into their liberty. Inpatient commitment is uprooting a person's life and arguably taking away their freedom. Also, the lecture stated that with outpatient commitment, an individual can retain the freedom to continue their lives in the community. That seems a better way to allow an individual their freedom while providing treatment, support, and the resources that they need.  "
1237,"I think there are many appropriate levels of success with both inpatient and outpatient involuntary commitment. If an individual is involuntarily committed and is provided with therapy, resources for support, and medication and that individual seems to show improvement and can enter into the community successfully then that should be a measure of success. That being said, if when that individual is living back in the community he or she does not receive those services or does not have the same resources to receive support and medication then that measure of success is no longer valid. In the lecture, we hear that the availability to resources is key and if communities do not have access to those resources, then that is a failure for both the individual and society. Further, in our text book, the authors state how inpatient civil commitment is driven by money and if that is the case and the focus is not on the patients' well being and improvement, then we cannot measure its success. Another measure of success, would be to measure whether or not there are less PWMI in the criminal justice system when people are committed to hospitals for mental health treatment instead.   Overall, I think society should focus on providing resources for outpatient treatment in the communities. This way, PWMI can have access to needed treatment while retaining their freedom.  "
1238,"Hi Liisa,  I really enjoyed reading your post. Your points regarding the appropriate measure of success were great and well thought out. I am specifically interested in the measure of reduced contact with law enforcement. I absolutely agree that this is a great measure of success. I often wonder what ways we can help move away from the criminal justice system as the mental health system. I'm thinking the most difficult part would be to ensure access to resources in the community once a person is out of that involuntary commitment. That being said, your idea around case management services and helping to provide access to housing, education, job, and financial resources is wonderful and I think would help tremendously. Do you think inpatient civil commitments have the same likelihood that PWMI will continue treatment as outpatients commitments? "
1239,"Hi Briana,  I really liked the structured, straight forward way you wrote your post. It was a great way to see the pros and cons. I was really interested by the direction you took around stigma. I hadn't necessarily thought about the powerful nature of simply educating those in the community on the realities of mental illness and how many individuals experience living with it. I agree that if we focused on educating people, there would be a higher likelihood that people would seek treatment or simply not be ashamed of getting treatment for their mental illness. I further agree that they should be supported and evaluated every step of the way and I think this is the difficult nature of civil commitment. When the treatment is over, how can the individual ensure they will continue to have access to the treatment. How can this issue be solved? I wonder if the funding is simply not there?"
1240,"I think many of the processes described would be hard for PWMI to navigate, but if I had to chose which would be most difficult, I would say entering into the system- especially if this person has never been involved in the system before. If the person with a mental illness is not receiving or does not have access to treatment, then it may be difficult to understand the situation or advocate for oneself. Further, maybe the crime was committed due to a symptom of a mental illness. In addition, I think entering into the system is the most difficult because PWMI often do not belong there and once they are in the criminal justice system, it becomes harder and harder for PWMI to get out."
1241,"Based on the follow-up video we watched, it seems as if it may be worse for PWMI to have jurisdictions changed to local because the jails are overcrowded and their are limited mental health services. The lecture informed us that the concerns include lack of funding for the local level and a concern that the process of simply moving individuals from state to local jurisdictions, would create an opportunity for things, like documents and records to be lost. PWMI may have been treated by doctors prior to their time in jail, and if the history of their mental health is lost, it could be detrimental to both the individual and the staff. The benefits for PWMI may include the idea that certain PWMI do not belong in prison and should have the opportunity for shorter sentences and then access to treatment, rather than incarceration. But, that being said, I think as long as the criminal justice system as a whole is responsible for the care and treatment of PWMI, it will be nearly impossible to get PWMI the resources that they need. "
1242,"No. I do not think it is ""fair"" that police often serve as firs responders to situation involving PWMI. I feel this way because police are not trained to know how to handle a situation with PWMI. The lecture, readings, and video above, all prove how police training for PWMI are simply not extensive enough. It is barely touched upon in academies. Our lecture also states that police would rather be perceived as crime fighters and not service providers and also feel that the Criminal Justice process is more expedient than mental health referrals. That all being said, it is clear that police do not have the right attitude, training, or perception to know how to successfully navigate a situation with PWMI and should therefore not serve as first responders for this population. "
1243,"The lecture states that among other benefits, CIT reduces law enforcement officers' stigmatizing attitudes toward people with mental illness. CIT is also related to stigma because if officers are trained on the symptoms of mental illness and how to address situations with PWMI differently than other individuals. CIT will also help officers keep PWMI out of jail and offer them the actual mental health services that they need. If officers do this, then others can learn to separate the needs of PWMI and the needs of someone involved in the Criminal Justice System and not put those categories together. I think by educating officers in CIT, it can help others learn the truth around PWMI, which will therefore help de-stigmatize it.  "
1244,"Given the Taheri findings related to the effectiveness of CIT, as the article states, law enforcement should work on outlining which calls need a CIT-related response. The article further states that the the importance of this distinction should not only be part of the CIT training but also be taught to non-CIT officers and dispatchers in order to avoid the misclassification of calls. Also, there should be a better way to evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of CIT. For example, there should be official and self-reported evaluations. The article goes further and discusses how these evaluations should measure where the training is most effective and where it is incorporated into practice. Because the Taheri findings were null, I think it is important to take a deeper look into why that is. Maybe there should be more extensive training or maybe there just needs to be better ways of recording it.  I spoke to my cousin who is an SFPD officer, and I asked him about his experience with CIT. He told me that he did receive training in the academy on CIT, but that using it as a police officer is rare. He talked about his experience and how in the moment, when there is real danger, it was rare that they used CIT. With this information, I thought about how training dispatchers in classifying CIT calls could help a lot with this. If a police officer knows that they are getting into a situation with a person with mental illness that is not a danger to others, then they can be ready and prepared to use their CIT training. "
1245,"Great post, Cornise! I think you made a great point about how CIT improves knowledge, perception, and attitudes. Since police officers frequently interact with PWMI, they should have extensive training and knowledge on what to do when they find themselves in a situation with PWMI. I agree that CIT could use improvements since Taheri (2016) found a null effect. Like the Taheri article states, I think a way to help in ensuring CIT is more successful, is to have dispatchers trained on classifying calls that require CIT use. To your point, I agree that the importance of CIT stems from creating understanding and knowledge around PWMI. With training of this nature, law enforcement will be able to understand the realities of PWMI and how PWMI should be treated with empathy, like you said, and should be given services and kept out of the criminal justice system. "
1246,"Stephanie, I really enjoyed reading your post! You had great suggestions to improve the effectiveness of CIT. I absolutely agree that CIT should be mandatory for law enforcement and there should be opportunities for professionals to demonstrate and dive in deeply to what using CIT in an interaction with PWMI looks like. At the end of the day, the reality is that law enforcement has many many interactions with PWMI, so there is no doubt that training for these situations should be available and mandatory. The reality is that PWMI should be treated and interacted with differently than people without a mental illness, so in order to keep them safe, and like you said, keep police officers safe, police officers must receive training on this. Your post also got me thinking about the video where actors play PWMI and create a simulation of an interaction that could happen. I think opportunities to engage in exercise like this for CIT training is very important and beneficial. "
1247,"The video was extremely powerful. For someone living with a mental illness to be arrested and jailed so many times can only make their mental illness worse. Also, to have that unsteady life and sporadic services, PWMI cannot be properly treated and receive the proper services. I think we need to focus on creating places in the community for PWMI to continue receiving treatment and services. And, if PWMI have trouble understanding exactly what is going on when they are arrested and jailed, that could create further distress and only worsen symptoms. We need to find ways to support PWMI in the community before they are put in a situation where they are arrested. "
1248,"Three indicators that jails should measure the rates of PWMI in jails, whether or not PWMI are provided medication, and the recidivism rates of PWMI (and specifically, how soon PWMI are being re-arrested. I think these indicators can help determine how the jail systems are dealing with PWMI and show whether or not the treatment that jails provide is helping at all.  "
1249,"I think jail inmates have too few rights. I have heard so many stories of inmates with mental illness not receiving the treatment that they need. And, these circumstances have led to inmate death. I also agree with CSG that inmates have the rights to discharge planning and should be given the tools to be successful when entering back into society. Inmates should have their medicaid suspended and not terminated because the idea should be setting these inmates up for success when they leave jail. Further, if inmates are diagnosed with a mental illness and maybe depending on the crime should be transferred to a place in the community for PWMI and not kept in jail, especially if the crime was perpetuated by the mental illness. I also believe that there needs to be more strict regulations and supervision to ensure that jail personnel are following the rules and laws around inmate rights. Even with the proper laws, if the staff is not properly following those, then jail inmates have even less rights than previously established."
1250,"I believe medication is the most common form of treatment, despite the fact that it costs so much, because it is effective and although it should require the regulation and overseeing of a psychiatrist, it is often few and far between that inmates see psychiatrists. (And therefore jails do not have to have a psychiatrist on site at all times). Medication is also a way to treat a mental illness that does not necessarily require a huge staff. If the limited staff is able to hand out medication to all inmates, jails chose to avoid therapy because psychiatrists are so scarce in the Criminal Justice System. I also think that medication is used because it can subdue and calm inmates down. Since medication can effect inmates in this way, it is easier for jail personnel to work with inmates that are not in a heightened state. "
1251," The use of jails for the seriously mentally ill is absolutely inappropriate. The required treatment and support services for PWMI are simply not available in jails. Raphael and Stoll (2013), state that ""it is certainly the case that a relatively high proportion of the currently incarcerated mentally ill would not have been incarcerated in years past and would likely be receiving inpatient treatment in a mental health facility."" This statement shows that the PWMI should be receiving the necessary treatment for the mental illness but instead are not receiving the proper services and are locked away behind bars and put into situations that perpetuate the symptoms of their mental illness. Jails are overpopulated and are underfunded.   The Realignment policy change absolutely affects the experience of PWMI. The lecture video states that there tend to be more resources for PWMI in prisons because of more generous state correctional budgets. But now, since many PWMI end up in jails, where the funding for treatment is inadequate, PWMI do not receive the proper treatment that they need. I think this affects the experience of PWMI in California jails because now they are in situations of overpopulation, where symptoms become worse. The lecture further states that jails are less stable and more chaotic. These are both factors that can perpetuate the symptoms of PWMI. "
1252,"Hi Jennifer,  I enjoyed reading your response! I also think that perhaps you are misremembering the realignment policy. Realignment is a reform policy that aimed to reduce the prison population which therefore increased the jail population. That being said, this still absolutely affects PWMI. To your point, treatment is available, albeit not all of the necessary support and treatment, but still PWMI may only have the opportunity for treatment in the justice system. This is the perfect example of why we need to focus our efforts on community based treatment and support services. "
1253,"Hi Danielle,  I really enjoyed reading your post! It was extremely informative and well said. The story you referenced above is extremely sad and unfortunately, no where near the first time I've heard of something like that happening. There are also stories where PWMI do not receive the proper treatment and have died because of it. We absolutely need to decriminalize mental illness. The problem will only get worse and worse if we do not actually treat and provide the proper services for PWMI. We need to focus efforts on community based treatment and support services. And to your last point, recidivism rates are an incredibly important measure for the Justice system's effectiveness and if these changes still do not decrease those rates then something needs to change now. "
1254,"I think it is ""fair"" to use risk assessment tools as long as they are not the only tool being used. Because these risk assessments are not 100% accurate, we should not rely solely on those tools to inform our decisions. That being said, I do think it is fair to allow these risk assessments to help inform the decision. In the video above, Charlie Hall states that we need ""science and strong human judgement."" I think this is a good example of the idea that we cannot rely solely on a single tool and that there needs to be discretion when making decisions that effect individuals in the criminal justice system. "
1255,"I think that mental health professionals would be receptive to the RNR approach because it is concerned with not only the mental illness, but the criminogenic needs of PWMI in the justice system. The RNR model is also concerned with providing services and treatment that are consistent with the abilities and learning styles of the offender. Also, cognitive behavioral techniques are often used with this model and I think mental health professionals would approve of this use.  Mental health professionals would be concerned with factors, other than recidivism. For example, they would be concerned with the PWMI's wellbeing and their ability to be a functioning member of society. They may be concerned with the safety of others in the community and the safety of the individual with mental illness. They likely want to ensure that any persons with mental illness will not harm themselves or others. They may also be concerned with ensuring that treatment and services for PWMI are readily available throughout the person's life. They are also likely concerned with the risk factors that PWMI pose."
1256,"I think probation is set up well to address supervision and treatment of PWMI. That being said, PWMI who are on probation need to be, for the most part, engaged and willing to participate. Also, if there are speciality caseloads, then I think probation can be even more successful in addressing supervision and treatment for PWMI. If POs are extensively trained in MI and what that means for PWMI in the justice system, then I think probation services can be really beneficial. I absolutely think probation addresses supervision and treatment of PWMI far better then jails do. Jails are not equipped and can oftentimes exacerbate symptoms in PWMI and make things worse. Probation allows PWMI to stay part of their community and hopefully build successful lives for themselves with the help of probation services. "
1257,"If I was a participant in a mental health court, I may feel embarrassed, but grateful that I have the opportunity to receive services and treatment. I would not prefer a tradition court processing because I do not think that that process offers the same kind of support and rehabilitation services. I may feel as the mental health court is stigmatizing, but at the end of the day I think that a mental health court can better address my needs, whereas a traditional court may just lock me up and I'd be in a position where I could not access the correct support, treatment, or medication. "
1258,"In speaking to a Chief Probation Officer about supervision of MI on probation, I would explain to her, the same caution that Skeem et al. (2015) speaks about in the article. Although the RNR model is widely accepted, there is no relevant research on the responsibility aspect. Most research around this model is focused on the risks and needs aspects of the RNR model. I would express that risks and needs assessments have little value without a strong evidence base (Skeem et al., 2015). I would explain that a lot more research needs to be conducted to understand the true effects of the RNR model and because of this, she should use this model ""deliberately"" (Skeem et al., 2015).   Another point that comes to mind is from the ""Knowledge Seminar"" where one of the speakers says that probation services should use science and strong human judgment. I think this a very important point that I would stress to the Chief Probation Officer. So, if the RNR model is used, I think that probation officers should ensure that they are making decisions, not solely from the risks and needs assessment, but using their discretion and knowledge of the probationer. "
1259,"Hi Lisa,  I enjoyed reading your post! I think your example around substance abuse is a great one. Also, I completely agree  that the responsibility approach would be useful. I actually think it would be the most useful part of the RNR model when probation officers supervise PWMI. The population that probation department serve are heterogenous, as Skeem et al. (2015) noted. So, with that fact, it seems that customizing the treatment and support services that PWMI on probation would be most beneficial to them. Now, there just needs to be more research on its effectiveness. I think it sounds like a great part of the RNR model and maybe even the most useful, so now we just need data to back that up. "
1260,"Hi Jennifer,  Great post! I absolutely agree that probation departments should not have a one size fits all approach, especially for PWMI. Skeem et al. (2015) stated that although there is some data on risks and needs assessments, there is very little date on the responsivity aspect of the model. And, I think it is this aspect that is most important in ensuring that every PWMI that is on probation will receive customized treatment and support services. "
1261,"I think many aspects of the prison environment would aggravate the condition of a person with mental illness. First, being taken out of a community that you know would aggravate the condition and on top of that, being punished with something like solitary confinement, may aggravate symptoms as well. Also, although they do have treatment and services for PWMI, it may not always be readily available in the prison system. Also, based on that video, it seems a lot of the correctional officers are of the mindset that punishment is the most effective, when we should really be focusing on rehabilitation, especially for PWMI. "
1262,"Given the discussion in the video, I do not think it is possible to truly rehabilitate prisoners with mental illness. In the video, she says that oftentimes prison exacerbates symptoms. Also, the goal should be to help these prisoners re-integrate into the community and I just don't think prison would every be able to do that with PWMI. The video further discusses how depression and anxiety often occur when entering prison and then when being released, but the goal should be to help people become successful in society. Also, prison is often focused on punishment when it should be focusing on rehabilitation. I think we should shift the focus from treating PWMI in prisons and creating more of community support services."
1263,"This is a hard question for me to answer because I think that the disadvantages of solitary confinement to the inmate is so strong that there are no advantages that outweigh the disadvantages. Solitary confinement is so detrimental to a person's physical and mental health, so I think that there should be an alternative to maintaining prison order. There has to be other methods that does not so heavily and negatively effect inmates. "
1264,"I am absolutely okay with my tax dollars being spent on treating the mentally ill in prison because I think it is extremely necessary. That being said, I also think I would like to know more about where the current tax dollars are being allotted. If there is a way to move funds from other aspects of prison, then I would want to do that. But even with that, I am personally very okay that my tax dollars are going to help those who are mentally ill in prison. "
1265," This is a really difficult question to answer. I don’t know if there is one single solution that will solve these problems in a cost effective way. The first thing that comes to mind is somehow decreasing the prison population. There are so many people in the prison system that I think could be rehabilitated in other ways. There should be more opportunities for community intervention and some policy changes  that could help correct the overflowing prison population.   I do feel that PWMI should be allocated the proper resources and if that means more need than inmates without mental illness then so be it. But that said, what needs to change is the kind of services. Clearly there is an understaffing issue but if there is a way to create community support services and help PWMI to not end up involved in the criminal justice system in the first place. Further, there should be more services for PWMI released from the prison system because we want to reduce recidivism and get PWMI the treatment and support they actually need to treat their mental illness, not put PWMI in places that exacerbate it. "
1266,"Hi Elise, I really enjoyed reading your post. I am intrigued by your suggestion around screening. Although that could help with finding the proper treatment and support services that an inmate my need, I worry that it may not help to reduce the population of PWMI in prison and I’m also wondering if it would Be cost effective. I’m thinking we should go back further and somehow create community services for PWMI and find other means of treating and rehabilitating PWMI who commit crimes, especially crimes that are caused by symptoms of the mental illness.  I loved your post! It really got me thinking. "
1267,"Hi Viviana, I really enjoyed reading your response to Stephanie’s post. Your point about the importance of separating the general population and people with mental illness really struck me. I also think by doing that, psychiatrists can do their job more efficiently and tend to the inmates who need it most. "
1268,"I would feel wonderful about having my taxes go to building the Fulton State Hospital. This is a step that overstate should take. Not only could new and improved facilities like the one shown in the video, but I think it could also be a step to moving PWMI out of prisons and jails and into environments where they can be supported and treated, rather than in an institution designed for punishment. I hope this is the first of many hospitals. That said, I'd love to explore how that hospital is doing today. "
1269,"Not at all. Like the lecture and video stated, less than 1% of cases use the NGRI and even less succeed with that plea. Also, this doesn't mean that they will not lose their freedom or be subject to rehabilitation services, it just means that they will be treated in a hospital. And like the above video stated, judges rarely sign off on letting individuals who've committed serious crimes walk free. "
1270,"I think the biggest problem is lack of adequate staff. Of course the understaffing comes form lack of proper funding, so I think something needs to change in regards to that. Staffing the facility with enough people to keep both patients and staff safe is extremely important. The above video notes that it was a 300 million dollar health hospital. So maybe the priority should be ensuring there will be enough funds to properly staff the hospital before building a large structure that holds more patients than it can appropriately treat. "
1271,"If doctors are safely and what seems like, oftentimes effectively using deep brain stimulation as a treatment for depression, then I feel happy about the potential it could bring to people suffering from severe depression. The video made me interested and confident that deep brain stimulation can really turn a person's life around. This is not the first time I've heard of a success story either. I've listened to podcasts on the subject and am fascinated by its effectiveness. That being said, I feel that since it is in the early stages of development and research, that we should tread carefully and ensure we are slowly trying to understand why this is working and why it does not in some patients. "
1272,"I think the most appropriate role for state hospitals is to focus on treatment and rehabilitation of persons with mental illness, so that individuals with mental illness do not end up in the criminal justice system. Sisti, Segal, and Emanuel (2015) state that there are ""new models of fully integrated, patient-centered long-term psychiatric care,"" that now exists in the United States. Worcester Recovery Center and Hospital, a transformed state hospital, ""provides a full range of integrated treatment services, psychiatric research, and medical education programs and has been at the forefront of using electronic medical records and patient-centered treatments: (Sisti et al, 2015). With these kinds of new and improved programs and treatments for PWMI, state hospitals have the opportunity to properly treat PWMI and help them avoid the criminal justice system, which does not have the proper resources for PWMI and oftentimes exacerbates symptoms of mental illness.  I believe that there should be certain state hospitals that are better designed, prepared, and trained to work with forensic patients. Fisher, Geller, and Pandiani (2009) discuss the growing population of forensic patients in state hospitals and notes that those state mental hospitals are liable for cost of those patients hospitalizations. That being said, if funding can be provided to create hospitals or even parts of state hospitals that are especially capable of treating and working with forensic patients, then both forensic and non-forensic patients can have the opportunity for treatment and support. "

1274,"Hi Denise,  I really enjoyed reading your post! You touched on so many great points. I also agree with your statement that there should be an expansion including sexually violent predators and patients who pose a danger to themselves or others. Based on the fact that 90% of patients who are committed to state hospitals are forensic patients, there should be extensive training on how to work and treat these patients.  State hospitals should be appropriately funded to have enough beds for persons with mental illness to receive treatment and support if and when they need it because the bottom line, is the criminal justice system is unequipped to rehabilitate or treat PWMI. Thanks for your great post!"
1275,"Hi Viviana,  I really enjoyed reading your response. I agree that state hospitals should treat forensic patients and patients who are at risk of involvement in the criminal justice system. I think that if we intervene before PWMI get involved in the justice system, they will have a much higher chance of being properly treated and supported.  I was also really struck by your point regarding the need for patient confidentiality. PWMI in prison do not receive this right and oftentimes it can be detrimental to their wellbeing. State hospitals are also incredibly important, like you said, because they have the ability to treat patients long term (with both in and out patient care) rather than release them back into the community without the necessary support, like the justice system does. "
1276,"I do not think the described forms of data sharing are satisfactory for really understanding the link between CJ and MH systems and their clients. I think there should be a better designed and regulated system that all CJ and MH systems follow. There should be clear guidelines and ways to share information between system. We need a form of data sharing that ensures the history of clients is not lost. There should be a more uniform data sharing system that has the necessary and accurate information regarding clients, in order to truly meet their mental health needs wherever they go. "
1277,"The CIT trained approach appears to create a more understanding and calm environment. Since the CIT officers are trained to know the signs and symptoms of PWMI. Like the video stated, CIT uses a more interpersonal approach. Sometimes law enforcement can enter a situation and, without the proper training, may not understand the signs of a PWMI and could respond in a way that ends up escalating the situation. It seems the CIT approach offers a de-escalating way of interacting with people. I feel as if the CIT approach brings in a lot more tools to work and support PWMI or others who are experiencing trauma or a heightened mood. It seems the outcomes of the CIT approach has a better opportunity to avoid volatility. "
1278,"I think it often takes a court order or other legal actions for departments of corrections to change the way PWMI are treated because it seems likely that there is not adequate funding, so departments of corrections would not likely want to change because it could be costly. It is also possible the staff is not trained well enough to understand the different needs of PWMI. There has also been a specific way of treating PWMI in prisons, and there is a chance that certain attitudes of staff may be hard to change. "
1279,"Mental health workers may have to deal with other staff members who do not know or understand the needs of the PWMI in correction environments. They are also dealing with a lot of different safety protocol. They likely do not have access to the inmates as much as they need, in order to truly treat and help rehabilitate  them. Mental health workers are also facing the fact that inmates are often moved or released without much notice, so there may not be proper planning for re-entry in the community or an inmate's medical history may somehow get lost in a transfer. I think cross-training correctional agencies/staff could be extremely beneficial for the care and treatment of PWMI in prisons and jails. Cross-training would allow staff a much deeper understanding of PWMI, the signs and symptoms to look for, and the best ways to help PWMI in crisis. I think cross-training could help eliminate suicides and other crises in the correctional environment. "
1280,"I feel the most essential training for mental health and criminal justice actors is trainings that helps everyone to understand the signs, symptoms, treatments, and supports for PWMI. Mental Health providers should be trained to understand the criminal justice system and the things that PWMI need within this system. I believe that mental health providers should be trained in the court process and the options within it for PWMI. On the flip side, I believe that actors in the criminal justice system, should be trained on signs and symptoms of mental illness and substance abuse. These actors should also understand the necessary treatment and support that PWMI may need within the system. I also believe that in order to effectively work and support PWMI within the justice system, the actors in this system should be trained in de-escalation tactics and what to do when someone with a mental illness is in crisis or exhibiting dangerous behavior. For example, the Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) model, seems to be a beneficial model in which criminal justice actors and mental health actors come together to collaborate and try to ensure PWMI safety when interacting with law enforcement. Watson and Fulambaker (2012), discuss how the CIT model ""involves changes in police department procedures as well as collaboration with mental health providers and other community stakeholders."" I believe an in depth training, like the CIT model, would be beneficial for everyone who may come into contact with a person with mental illness or substance abuse.  The Council of State Governments (CSG) Justice Center has great training and learning objectives  around mental health and the court. The modules that CSG begins with includes learning about the mental health and substance abuse systems, understanding symptoms and terminology, and what kind of treatment is needed for PWMI and those with cooccurring substance abuse. I believe these basics are extremely important in understanding how to provide treatment and services that will truly benefit PWMI. Overall, I believe training for actors in both the mental health and criminal justice systems is extremely necessary in order to truly benefit PWMI. "
1281,"Hi Liisa,  I really enjoyed reading your post! I absolutely agree with your take on the discussion question. I also found your point on stigma and implicit bias to be extremely important and an aspect I hadn't discussed in my post. I completely agree that having training around stigma, implicit bias, and cultural competency, would benefit PWMI. I think a training like this could help open the eyes of those who work with PWMI.  I also liked your suggestions regarding training for cross agency interactions and referrals. I work with many agencies, including a partnership with the Juvenile Probation Department and I find that we must continue to have meetings and trainings for both my staff and their staff to truly get our referral process down. So, having personal experience with this, I think a training on referring PWMI would be very beneficial. "
1282,"Hi Stephanie,  I enjoyed reading your post. I agree that the CIT model would absolutely be beneficial for all actors in the mental health and criminal justice system. That said, your post reminded me of what Watson and Fulambarker (2012), said about the CIT model, stating, ""while the centerpiece of the model is 40 hours of specialized training for a select group of officers that volunteer to become CIT officers, proponents stress that CIT is more than just training...CIT is an organizational and community intervention that involves changes in police department procedures as well as collaboration with mental health providers and other community stakeholders."" One this that really struck me here is the fact that officers must volunteer to take the CIT training and become a CIT officer. Although I think this program should absolutely be available, I do think it needs to be more widespread, or another model that is integrated into the academy and throughout the careers of officers and providers, should be created and used. I agree that 40 hours is not enough training to truly do right by PWMI. So, in order to truly create the ""changes in police department procedures,"" and the collaboration with mental health providers and the community, I think we need to integrate trainings and change the attitude that it is a separate training. Training on PWMI and substance abuse should be included in mandatory trainings due to the every growing number of PWMI involved in the criminal justice system. "
1283,"I believe that the violent offenders require a different kind of treatment. When PWMI pose a high risk of hurting themselves or others, then a diversion program, like the one in Fairfax, is not likely suited to support those needs. I do believe that there should be diversion programs specifically designed to treat violent offenders with mental illness. I definitely do not think they should have to go through the CJ system without mental health treatment and support. It will look different, but it still needs to happen. "
1284,"I think both criminal justice and mental health share similar hurdles and also very different ones. The CJ system has to work within stricter parameters than mental health agencies in the community. With that said, when actors in the CJ sysem want to implement evidence based practices, they likely have to go through more channels, which can make it more difficult to truly start using those practices. Also, since the CJ system has many PWMI within it, they have two aspects that they are dealing with- the criminal justice matters and the mental health matters. Within mental health agencies, they are working with PWMI in the community, and therefore have more access to their clients and may have an easier time implementing these evidence based practices.  Further, their funding is likely very different. the criminal justice system has funds for many aspects of the system, whereas mental health agencies can use their funding solely for mental health programs and therefore may have an easier time implementing evidence based practices.   "
1285,"I believe that an integrated MH and Substance Abuse model within the justice system would greatly increase the effectiveness of treatment for individuals with co-occurring disorders. With an integrated program, individuals can get the proper treatment in the justice system and be set up for success when re-entry takes place. Since a dual diagnosis is so common, an integrated program would make the most sense for individuals in the CJ system. An integrated program would create a way for more people to receive the treatment they need and to really get to the root of their problem, rather than only dealing with one aspect of it. I so hope that integrated programs begin to become the norm in both the community and CJ system. I truly believe it could change the outcome for many of these people and truly help people succeed for their entire lives, not just for the time in which they are incarcerated. "
1286,"Absolutely. I find that peer mentoring can be helpful in addressing stigma because it exemplifies that PWMI are very much capable of being treated and living successful lives...enough to become a peer mentor to someone else. Peer mentoring also creates an environment, in which mental illness is completely accepted and understood on a level that may not be the same in the community. With a peer mentor, PWMI have the opportunity to be completely at ease and not judged because they know that their mentors have had similar experiences. Peer mentoring can create a powerful network of PWMI who help each other and this can help ease the fear of seeking treatment and support. "
1287,"Hi All :),  My name is Janee. I'm from and currently reside in the San Fernando Valley. I received my bachelors in Criminal Justice and Psychology from Grambling State University located in Grambling, Louisiana. I stumbled on the MFLP program very early in my search for grad school. At first I thought the program was too good to be true so I began shopping around for other programs as well. However, no other school offered such a unique blend of Criminal Justice and Psychology quite like UCI, so its safe to say I stuck with my first choice! Like so many others, throughout my undergraduate years, I've always been interested in analyzing the minds of hardcore criminals such as serial rapists, serial killers, and mass murderers. Specifically, I wonder if these criminals contain different receptors or triggers than the average human, causing them to act in the manner they've chosen.  Or, does their mental state stem precisely from a troubled past. Moreover, my only experience with this topic comes from taking Psychology and Law last fall where we touched on how individuals with mental health issues are treated within legal proceedings. This quarter I hope to gain more insight concerning the in's and out's of the criminal mind and what is considered a ""criminal mind"". Also, I hope to gain an in depth understanding of what rights and policy is in place for those with mental health issues, as they can be easily swayed in the justice system."
1288,"Based on the 60 Minutes video detailing the untimely death of Timothy Souders, I find this utter negligence for another human being mentally ill or not quite frightening. As mentioned within the video by clinical psychologist Robert Walsh, as soon as Souders was transferred to the Michigan facility mental health professionals should have been consulted immediately once the facts of his case were disclosed. Further, as Souders attempted numerous suicidal acts, these actions screamed the need for increased clinical attention to Souders behavior. However, instead Souders was met with top-of-bed restraints and solitary confinement for great hours at a time. The care for this young man was non-existent. He was treated like a violent criminal first and not an individual who most likely suffered from a psychological problem. If mental health professionals were first contacted I believe the care of Souders could have improved and he wouldn't have been treated with such carelessness. Moreover, in regard to other initiatives that could have taken place to prevent Souders' death, top-of-the-bed restraints should not have interfered with his right to food and water no matter his refusal. Also, if Souders had already attempted to commit suicide three time before, I would think it be more beneficial to not leave him alone to dwell away in solitary confinement. "
1289,"Non-medical considerations has driven the provision of treatment and care for those with mental illnesses since the beginning of its history. From the notion of behaviors being influenced by evil spirits to being heavily guided by religion, the conceptualization of how mental illness is contracted or spread has had a track record of harboring little medical insight. As history presents, treatment for people with mental illness has been fueled by the fear of the unknown and political and authoritative figures. Lastly, this lecture has shown me that the history of treatment and care for the mentally ill was never truly rooted with the goal of rehabilitation but, to lock up these disturbed individuals and throw away the key. "
1290,"No, I do not see the benefits in creating a national registry of PWMI's. I find it very unjustified that people who suffer from an illness would be forced to expose their difficulties for all to see, as if they are at fault or should be ashamed. Moreover, creating such a registry does not ensure  a decrease in gun violence as those will mental illnesses only account for a small percentage of violence within the United States. Personally, the push for such a registry is an act by politicians, the media and supporters for bearing arms (such as the NRA) to put blame on a vulnerable population that cannot fight back. "
1291,"In regard to PWMI's, the biggest problem the general population needs to focus on is becoming more socially inclusive. Since the beginning of the NIMBY movement, society has shunned those with mental illnesses and has removed them as far as possible from normalcy. Society needs to make greater efforts to handle PWMI's with compassion, dignity and respect instead of treating them as less than human beings. Isolating PWMI's only increases the problem due to the fact that we are stripping these people of the chance of living regular lives. If we continue to treat PWMI's as criminals and/or violent persons without history of such behavior, we are crippling their chances of progression and ultimately failing to truly care for them. "
1292,"Throughout history we have seen people suffering from mental illness treated as less than human time and again. In the era of pre-civilization, those suspected of mental illness were said to be linked to evil spirits and were ultimately banished by their families due to their peculiar behavior potentially jeopardizing the well-being of said family. During ancient civilization, the view of PWMI's actually took a slight turn for the better as ancient Greeks and Romans believed the mentally ill were people in need and should be treated humanely. However, the treatment for these mentally ill persons during this time was a little misguided as Hippocrates preached that mental illness stemmed from the body instead of the brain. Thus, to treat PWMI's he emphasized the use of laxatives and surgery to cleanse the body of such impurities. Moreover, as the middle ages came around, the use of religion rose as a powerful piece in the movement of society and became closely intertwined with government operations. Due to this overbearing use of religion, PWMI's were once again viewed as evil and/or the work of the devil. Thus, the idea of ""demonology"" heavily influenced those diagnosed and treated for mental illnesses. For instance, participants of Judaism believed an evil spirit called a ""dybbuk"" would possess individuals and bring out mental illnesses. In Egypt, people would search for ""stigmata diablo"" or devil spots on peoples bodies to identify those who had been possessed by demonic spirits. However, the biggest raid for those affected by so-called devilish spirits was the ""Malleus Maleficarum"" during the late 1400's. Comprised by the Catholic church, for nearly 250 years people who were suspected of being witches were identified, interrogated and punished. Approximately 600,000 to about nine million people dubbed as ""outcasts"" such as the mentally ill were tortured and killed.  During the Renaissance and pre-civil war era, a new notion emerged to handle PWMI's. Hospitals and asylums dedicated to housing ""lunatics"" began to rise. Here we saw those labeled as mentally ill or even those considered a nuisance to their families locked away in institutions claiming to be able to treat the insane. Therefore, during these eras the temperament of society was to treat mentally persons as ""out of sight and out of mind"". Sadly, this way of thinking carried far into America's history, specifically with the NIMBY movement. State hospitals housing the mentally ill were"
1293,"Hi Robert,  Great post. For starters, you're absolutely right, in 2019 the world should have better developed treatment and care programs for PWMI's. However, until society makes a dramatic shift in the right direction by treating those mental illness with dignity and respect, this infamous cycle will continue. As Crystal Dieleman mentioned in her TedTalk, the needs of mental health patients are reasonable needs that any human being would want in return such as, a secure place to live, structure in their daily lives, social connection to others and/or gainful employment. Once our society accomplishes these essential but basic needs for PWMI's, hopefully we can see real change in the treatment in their treatment and they're able to develop a sense of belonging in society. "
1294,"Hi Sayla,  Interesting post. You brought light to a great point that I didn't think about before concerning the surge of advocacy for mental illness by celebrities. I hope this new found publicity for those suffering from mental illness brings people to understand that mental illness can affect all types of people and those with more severe cases deserve just as much attention, maybe even more. Additionally, along with this advocacy, I hope the stigma of PWMI's being portrayed as violent individuals decreases as this notion is largely far from the truth, PWMI's only account for about 3-5% of violent offenses committed in the United States. Thus, if these two dilemmas can be accomplished, I believe PWMI's will finally be able to wholeheartedly integrate back into society free of ridicule and isolation. "
1295,"As the president, one holds an enormous amount of power within society. Thus, the perspective and aspirations of the president can potentially shape the mindset of a nation. In the  Rüsch, Angermeyer and Corrigan article (2005), researchers made note that the concept and negative consequences of a stigma only holds weight if the group being stigmatized carries less power than the stigmatizing group (Link & Phelan, 2001). Therefore, a prominent figure such as the president of the United States definitely holds a ""big stick"" in the way mental  illness can be perceived. As we saw with President Obama, his initiative to put a stop to the mental illness stigma opens the door for policy implications, in/outpatient facilities and overall change in the way PWMI are treated in regard to stereotypes, discrimination and prejudice behavior ( Rüsch et al., 2005).   Link BG, Phelan JC. Conceptualizing stigma. Annu Rev Sociol 2001; 27:363–85.  Rüsch, N., Angermeyer, M. C., & Corrigan, P. W. (2005). Mental illness stigma: Concepts, consequences, and initiatives to reduce stigma.

1296,"In terms of worthiness, the drastic and frequent budget cuts made to mental health services across the nation corroborates the notion that policymakers are not overly concerned about the well-being and care of PWMI's. If anything, the treatment allocated to PWMI's costs the government money instead of generating new revenue such as other illnesses like cancer or Alzheimer's. In the case of these illnesses, society views these patients as helpless and ""in need"" while those with mental illness are perceived as at fault for their condition. Therefore, if the general population lives in fear or is bothered by the presence of PWMI's, policymakers are not going to put their money somewhere (mental health services) where they can't get it back or even lose it. Thus, to save costs and ensure constant revenue, mental health concerns and necessities are neglected. "
1297,"Concerning new ways of mental health treatment for active military and veterans, I believe the best medicine for these service members is to talk to someone. As the veteran mentioned in the short film, the best treatment he has received to deal with his PTSD has been to converse with other veterans about the trials and tribulations they've experienced in battle and upon returning home. Sometimes, the best coping mechanism for individuals is to simply have someone to confide in without judgement or dismay. Further, being able to express one's issues among people of similar walks of life makes it all the more comforting as those alike can lean on each other for support and understanding. Thus, along with providing stable living and employment arrangements for veterans, incorporating daily peer groups and individual mentors or advocates (who are also veterans) could be greatly beneficial to these troops in need. "
1298,"I find this question exceptionally tricky as we totter on the fine line of what should be deemed appropriate involuntary treatment and what should not. With that being said, I do feel like mandated treatment is necessary in some cases of mental illness, such as more severe diagnoses (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, etc.). However, I'm aware that a big escape goat for allowing ill treatment of PWMI's is to say, ""they're a great danger to themselves and therefore a possible danger to others"", as we saw last week in the case of Timothy Souders. Therefore, while I believe in the need for mandated treatment, such treatment needs to handled in moderation and with care. If society chooses to step in and require treatment for certain PWMI's, mental health practices need to reflect more successful rates of stabilization. Hence, leading PWMI's to be effectively reintegrated into society rather than horror stories. "
1299,"PWMI in this country have been treated as less than human for decades on end. In present time, social isolation between society and those with mental illness has improved in some ways in regard to spreading awareness and advocating for overall acceptance. However, the majority still lives in fear and has numerous negative preconceived conceptions pertaining to this population. Such preconceived notions concerning PWMI's include, the belief that they are inherently violent and there so-called illness is a result of poor moral character (Lecture 2-2). These notions have contributed to an overpowering public stigma among society, creating negative stereotypes, discrimination and prejudice behavior, all aimed at the mentally ill (Rüsch, Angermeyer & Corrigan, 2005). Moreover, to combat this overbearing public stigma, society needs to break the social barrier between ""us"" and ""them"" when referring to PWMI. It's not fair to treat others suffering from physical illnesses such as cancer with different labels as if their illness is acceptable and mental illness is not. Thus, to promote acceptance of all illnesses and debunk these labels and groups, it's important to properly educate the public (Rüsch et al., 2005). Providing the public with pamphlets and instructional/informative books and videos about PWMI reduces the possibility of stigma to fester. Further, Rusch and colleagues (2005) believe the combination of education and contact with PWMI's is the strongest tool to defeat stigma.  Thus, to accomplish this goal, it's important to promote contact with PWMI's sooner than later. Therefore, implementing curricula for mental health awareness in elementary, middle and high school is essential. Within these teachings, teachers should promote known facts about PWMI's and refute negative stereotypes. Additionally, teachers should treat these informative sessions as open discussions as well to encourage children to voice any concerns and misconceptions they may have referring to mental illness and maybe even share their own experiences. The goal during these tender years is to ensure children are properly informed but, also emphasize that mental illness is nothing to be ashamed nor afraid of. Further, as students become more aware of the trails and tribulations faced by PWMI, contact should then be implemented, specifically with other students suffering from mental illness. With this, I hope for students to develop a sense of compassion and understanding"
1300,"Hi Cornise,  Great post! I agree with your proposal for age appropriate teachings among the different school levels, it's important that these children grasp the material wholeheartedly as this topic is not one that can simply ""go over one's head"". Likewise, I enjoyed how you broke down the different curricula for each age range and put great emphasis on the need for inclusion, especially for middle and high school students. Teaching children such tools that not only focus on mental health awareness but, how to be kind and display inclusive traits towards one another is extremely important due to the fact that individuals first experience with negative stigma and social isolation is most likely on school grounds. "
1301,"Hi Liisa,  I enjoyed your view concerning the obligation educational systems have towards their immediate student body and then to others. I took this to mean that schools should first educate their immediate student population about other classmates who suffer from mental illness and then expand the scope to the rest of the mentally challenged community. If we want children to build life-skills aimed at social inclusion and eliminate forms of stigma against PWMI, it's easier to implement such a message if the affected audience looks just like you. Thus, while teachers apply these teachings to their curriculum, it's important that students have the chance to interact with children of the same age who suffer from mental illness as well. Applying these applications together ensures that students gain a well-rounded understanding of their peers who suffer from mental illness and makes it easier to apply these learned tools to other PWMI's in the future. "
1302,"Considering the concepts on specificity and sensitivity in regard to civil commitment, I believe these concepts would greatly influence whom court officials, society and mental health practitioners deem mentally unstable and therefore involuntarily commit. However, due to the fact that the justice system rests on the ill notion that mental health professionals can predict dangerousness, this could lead to highly inaccurate and overestimated results. In terms of a ""false positive"", this would represent an increase in test sensitivity in which people without a mental health issue are found highly predicted to have a problem/considered dangerous due to the tests sensitivity to catch the slightest hint of suspected mental illness. A false negative on the other hand, would represent an increase in specificity. Meaning, if the specifics of what is considered a mental illness are minimized, some participants that would otherwise be considered a risk due to their mental illness may fall outside the specified perimeters of the test. "
1303,"The decision to involuntarily commit sex offenders is a flawed system. Moreover, the decision to commit these individuals considered to be SVP's needs to be held on a case by case basis, as the threshold for determining SVP's seems to be relatively low and open for interpretation. Additionally, the practice of deciphering who is deemed an SVP and sent to these psychiatric facilities seems to follow a ""sensitivity"" model as described in the previous lecture. Meaning, rather than take the chance of releasing a sexual predator back into society upon time served in prison, court officials would rather ensure the safety of society by increasing the sensitivity of what is considered a sexual violent predator. Therefore, this potentially leads to the civil commitment of any sexual predator that may or may not commit a crime in the future. Personally, this line of thinking is incredibly unjust as predictors of violence practiced by mental health professionals are not reliable but yet, still used in court proceedings. "
1304,"I definitely consider inpatient commitment to be a lager reach of state authority into an individual's liberties. While either inpatient or outpatient treatment can be bestowed involuntarily, at least those under outpatient treatment still have the opportunity to function within society. Those under inpatient treatment are confined within hospital walls and treatment is indeterminate. On the other hand, individuals under outpatient commitment have the potential to live normal lives and grow in society as they comply with their treatment program. Thus, while both forms of involuntary treatment have been criticized, outpatient commitment seems to be the lesser of two evils as it increases the likelihood for continued treatment, potentially increases medication compliance, can lead to a better quality of life and contains the possibility of reducing criminal victimization among PWMI's. "
1305,"In regard to these forms of involuntary commitment, some may argue that there are no pros to these concepts. However, there are some grounds that outpatient involuntary commitment (OTC)  is considered the less invasive of the two as inpatient commitment practically strips an individual of their liberties. Though, some may argue that inpatient commitment is necessary in instances of grave disability or ""need for treatment"" where the individual is potentially a threat to themselves and others. Another argument for involuntary inpatient care is that such treatment releases the burden from society/families from having to provide necessary patient needs. On the other hand, advocates for outpatient involuntary commitment stay true to the argument that OTC encourages and has depicted higher compliance with treatment, in reference to medication and case management services. Additionally, OTC has been found to increase the likelihood of continued treatment among PWMI's even after required treatment ends. Moreover, continued treatment and compliance among OTC patients has the potential to lead to a better quality of life, decrease the chance of homelessness and criminal victimization and minimize incidences of self-harm. However, with these improvements, critics believe OTC contains a great number of flaws similar to those of inpatient involuntary commitment. Thus, alike inpatient involuntary commitment, OTC has also been perceived as coercive in nature due to state legislations' use of power beyond the hospital and into communities. Further, OTC has also been viewed as anti-therapeutic, stigmatizing and discriminatory. Though, separate from inpatient commitment, OTC statutes have also gained a reputation for deception in regard to ""forced medication"". Many patients believe if they do not take the medication their program requires they will be deemed noncompliant and possibly face inpatient commitment, which is not true on such grounds alone. Therefore, it's evident that both inpatient and outpatient involuntary commitment practices are deeply in need of improvement concerning the treatment of patients. With that being said, to appropriately measure the success of these practices, efforts need to focus on improving the longevity of these patients as they reintegrate back into society. The beneficial outcomes associated with OTC are great examples of securing longevity (decrease in criminal victimization, self-harm, better overall life). Although r"
1306,"Hi Bethannie,  Interesting outlook on this topic! As we've seen throughout the week, condoning the use of involuntary commitment is a complex situation. Concerning inpatient commitment, while stripping someone of their civil liberties is without a doubt ethically questionable, it's hard to determine if these mentally ill individuals would seek treatment otherwise. As you mentioned, it is a pro to have mental health professionals on hand for these patients as they would not be able to receive such intensive care elsewhere. However, I believe the biggest issue that lies within inpatient commitment is that patients don't seem to be receiving services to effectively reintegrate them back into society but, to simply harbor them away from society indefinitely. If we want to sincerely improve the lives of PWMI's and break public stigma, inpatient programs need to care and provide treatment with the goal of preparing PWMI's to live successful lives outside of hospital walls. Additionally, I agree your notion to prolong the process of admission into involuntary inpatient care as taking away an individuals' civil liberties is a serious matter that deserves thorough examination and a second opinion. "
1307,"Hi Gabby,  I enjoyed your post and agree on a couple of points. First, I too see the benefits that can come from inpatient commitment if executed appropriately. If PWMI's under inpatient commitment are provided with treatment that guarantees  their success in society, I completely support such treatment. Though, you made a very good point by stating the necessity for available resources once these patients leave inpatient care. Our textbook also mentions, due to a lack of funds allocated to mental health services, many PWMI's receive inadequate or no additional guidance they desperately need once returning to society. Further, such lack of guidance could potentially land PWMI's back into inpatient care or worse, the criminal justice system. Therefore, I completely agree with your sentiments about putting great emphasis on the betterment of outpatient services. Focusing on the improvement of such services increases the chance of PWMI's being able to successfully live amongst others and more importantly protect them from being a danger to themselves. "
1308,"Personally, I assume PWMI's would struggle the most through the adjudication phase of the criminal process. I come to this conclusion due to the fact that those with severe mental illnesses may not contain the capacity to fully comprehend the adversarial process of the criminal justice system. Additionally, due to their lack of comprehension this could lead PWMI into entering unfair plea deals with prosecution, potentially serving harsher sentences that do not equate to the crime at hand. Lastly, if those with mental illnesses cannot move forward with the trial due to lack of understanding this could involuntarily land them in a mental health institution until they can at least comprehend the basics of court proceedings. "
1309,"Recent changes in California corrections concerning the shift of power and responsibility of low-level felons from state to local jurisdictions is a sticky situation for PWMI. On one hand, due to the passing of Prop. 47, left over state funds not being spent on corrections is to be allocated to other state necessities, specifically mental health and substance abuse services. As we saw last week, outpatient treatment centers for PWMI are slim. An increase in funds could mean the opening of more facilities and enhanced all-around services.  Conversely, Prop. 47 also reduced non-violent and non-serious drug and property offenses to misdemeanors. Thus, leading to the release of PWMI's considered lower-level offenders. Although this seems like a benefit, this actually reduces the chance of PWMI receiving needed treatment they would otherwise receive while in jail or prison. Additionally, PWMI who are incarcerated also face a chance of not receiving treatment as county jails have now become overcrowded with inmates and budget cuts have been made, especially to mental health services. "
1310,"Yes, I do believe it is fair that police serve as first responders to incidences involving PWMI. While interactions between PWMI and police have had dier consequences, it is law enforcement's job to protect and serve the entire community at hand. Therefore, police should ensure the safety of PWMI as they would with others. Additionally, I do not believe any other professionals such as mental health professionals would be equipped to deal with the numerous amount of scenarios that could transpire out in the field. While other professionals may have a better chance of reasoning with PWMI, they are not prepared for outside factors that could come about in high intensity situations. Separately, I believe the bigger issue lies within the training law enforcement undergo to deal with such situations involving PWMI, they are simply ill prepared. "
1311,"CIT and stigma are related in a few ways. First, if the use of CIT helps to reduce stigmatizing attitudes among law enforcement concerning PWMI, this new found compassion could influence the views of the public as well. As law enforcement is actively making an effort to reduce the chance death of police officers and PWMI through reasoning and understanding, hopefully such treatment pushed by a powerful source (police) will encourage society to do the same. Second, as CIT increases the access to mental health services for PWMI, this new support by law enforcement could potentially pressure jurisdictions to maintain the upkeep of facilities and/or create new ones. "
1312,"The Taheri (2016) article suggests that the effectiveness of the Memphis model of CIT is inclusive. The article aimed to compare law enforcement officers trained in CIT-training and officers that did not receive training, based on measures concerning interactions with PWMI such as, arrests, use of force and officer injury during an encounter. Findings suggested that there is an insufficient amount of evidence to conclude if CIT training techniques across the country are beneficial or harmful to officers and/or the PWMI community. Such lack of evidence was due to inconsistencies in defining what constituted as a ""call for service"" (Taheri, 2016) for a mentally ill individual, making it difficult to determine which calls were considered ""mental health calls"". Additionally, reported data regarding the mentioned measures above were gathered through self-reports by officers as well as official records. With that being said, self-reports of arrests involving PWMI compared to official records were skewed, leading to further limitations in results. Thus, overall implications from the study insinuated that the Memphis model of CIT may have no effect on outcomes of arrest or use of force by police officers in incidences involving PWMI (Taheri, 2016). However, Taheri put great emphasis on the fact that findings from this study do not reflect significant harms or benefits from the use of the CIT model. Therefore, completely throwing away the Memphis CIT model does not suffice. More so, the Memphis CIT model should be further explored in order to generate more data concerning how this model effects these two parties (police officers and PWMI). Further, uniformity in how the Memphis CIT model is executed throughout the country should be implemented. By doing so, compare groups can be adequately measured for future research and common ground among jurisdictions can be reached in regard to specific definitions and tactics. Lastly, I find it essential for this type of training to be mandatory instead of voluntary. Treating this type of training as an option minimizes how important it is for law enforcement to find effective ways to ensure safety as well as help and communicate with the PWMI community in times of crisis.     Taheri, S. A. (2016). Do Crisis Intervention Teams Reduce Arrests and Improve Officer Safety? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Criminal Justice Policy Review, 27</i"
1313,"Hi Suz, Great post! I agree with your sentiments wholeheartedly. The use of the Memphis CIT model needs to be further implemented and explored. As the Taheri article exemplifies, there is simply not enough evidence to generate a conclusive consensus on the model's effectiveness. In addition, I also mentioned the need for CIT training to be mandatory. Using such a promising technique on only voluntary grounds leaves room for contamination of results (as we saw) due to the fact that officers who volunteer and receive CIT training most likely have previously established contact with PWMI or have knowledge of de-escalation techniques (Taheri, 2016). Additionally, the tools and techniques that can be learned from in-depth CIT training is too invaluable to be voluntary. The more this method of training is pushed across the country, the greater the chance for police and PWMI interactions to end positively rather than negatively as they have in the past. The main goal should be for law enforcement to become better equipped to handle and care for those with mental illness as it relates to their job, hopefully decreasing PWMI's entrance into the criminal justice system and simultaneously increasing referrals to mental health facilities. "
1314,"Hi Elise,  Enjoyed your post. As most of us can agree, the drastic decision to completely halt the use of the Memphis CIT model is premature. Moreover, as you mentioned there are a numerous amount of benefits that can be gained by the continued use of CIT such as, increased referrals to mental health facilities by police officers and reduction in stigmatizing attitudes against PWMI. However, to further increase the probability of these benefits, CIT needs to not only to be more widely implemented but also evaluations of the model need to be improved. For example, when evaluating a practice implemented on a specific population, Taheri mentioned that clearly establishing whom and what is considered apart of said population is crucial and needs to be universally agreed upon. Moreover, as mentioned in the article, the lack of consensus upon what was considered a ""call of service"" towards PWMI negatively impacted results and left ambiguity within the definition. Thus, as further research on the effectiveness of CIT is explored, agreement regarding the procedures, definitions and goals of the training program need to be universal in order to gather useful data. "
1315,"For a mentally ill individual to be constantly arrested and jailed more than 100 times, it must feel like a regularly occurring event to them. Sadly, it may be one of the most stable things in their lives at the moment. Due to the fact that county jails are being treated as the ""new insane asylums"", many PWMI are most likely accustom to a jail cell. However, jail officials are greatly ill prepared to deal with such individuals and lack the funding to properly care for such needs. Additionally, while it may be a reoccurring experience, it must be incredibly frustrating for a PWMI to be locked up and spit right back out on the streets with no help or guidance. "
1316,"In reference to the concept of indicators, the purpose is to provide a snapshot of how current initiatives or treatments are functioning within a specific population. Thus, jails should focus on measuring the following in regard to mental illness, how many inmates have been prescribed and are actively taking medication, how many inmates after being released enter into outpatient or inpatient programs and measure the amount of PWMI who reenter the correctional system. First, it's important to account for inmates who have been prescribed medication while in jail as this gives an outlook on how many individuals have been deemed mentally ill by jail officials. Second, recording the amount of PWMI whom upon release enter outpatient or inpatient facilities (voluntarily or involuntarily) could potentially help researchers determine the quality of care being attributed to PWMI while incarcerated. Lastly, accounting for the number of PWMI who have reentered the corrections system on more than one occasion could possibly provide some descriptive characteristics concerning which mentally ill individuals are more likely to reenter the system. "
1317,"Personally, jail inmates are given too few rights. However, while these individuals are imprisoned and therefore give up certain rights to an extent, I find a flaw in the manner in which rights are distributed to inmates in regard ""right to refusal of treatment"". While jail officials are required to consider a number of factors in order to preserve a balance between an individuals due process rights and institutional needs, the fact that individuals are not afforded the right to an adversarial hearing in regard to this manner is concerning. Alienating jail inmates of this right basically means their consent to treatment is not necessary, which is deeply alarming and teetering on a fine line of violating their 8th Amendment. "
1318,"While medication may consume a large percentage of jail budgets, it's probably the easiest and fastest form of treatment to distribute among the jails in comparison to other treatments such as, psychotherapy or telepsychiatry. In addition, even though medications may cost jails a great amount of money, the administration on these drugs is most likely a booming business for suppliers. Moreover, it's probably easier and less time consuming for jail officials to just force inmates with mental illness to take prescribed medications rather than explore other avenues that may take a lengthier amount of time per inmate. "
1319,"Based on this week’s readings, the use of jails for the seriously mentally ill seems highly inappropriate due to the fact that these correctional institutions are highly ill equipped to maintain the needs of this population. As funding allocated to county jails are slim and states have now taken a “hands off” approach in regard to these low-level offenders, the treatment PWMI are typically afforded while under correctional supervision has become increasingly less attentive. Additionally, while these institutions remain increasingly underfunded, this also affects the productivity of jail operations as jails are becoming highly understaffed. For example, a lecture video depicted in Week 4 captured the inside of a local Orange County jail where portions of the jail were completely shut down due to lack of funds. In addition, the officer giving the tour of the jail mentioned that the facility’s mental health accommodations were also facing a major hit due to lack of specialized staff and overcrowding. However, this is not the case just in Orange County, as bed counts in county jails are drastically decreasing due to overcrowding. According to Torrey, Kennard, Eslinger, Lamb & Pavle (2010), in 1955 there was one psychiatric bed to every 300 Americans. As of 2005, there is one psychiatric bed per every 3,000 Americans (Torrey et al., 2010). These statistics support the notion that jails are not appropriate or able to support the treatment needs of PWMI effectively. Moreover, in California as realignment and policies alike (Prop. 47 and Prop.57) have taken place, a number of lower-level non-violent and non-serious offenses have been reduced to misdemeanors. Thus, as PWMI are more likely to be arrested for drug and property offenses (Raphael & Stoll, 2013; Lecture 4.2), realignment policies have reduced the chance of PWMI being booked into jail. Though while this may seem like a benefit, this means PWMI are placed back on the streets where they initially got into trouble and left with no treatment. Therefore, these changes to California jails still leaves PWMI at risk for further criminal justice contact and treatment options are becoming less easily attainable.   Raphael, S., & Stoll, M. A. (2013). Assessing the Contribution of the Deinstitutionalization of the Mentally Ill to Growth in the U.S. Incarceration Rate.  The Journal of Legal Studies,  42(1), 187–222. https:"
1320,"Hi Elise,  You're absolutely right, realignment efforts in California and in other states has put an exceeding amount of pressure on county correctional systems to provide treatment to a population they're not adequately able to serve. However, outside of the justice system there are not many institutions readily available to treat the mentally ill community as state funds afforded to mental health services have not been distributed effectively as well. Thus, as you mentioned there needs to be an alternative. What additional alternative do you believe could be in place to effectively treat these individuals and decrease PMWI criminal contact? Personally, as more CIT training efforts are being explored, this may be the first step in the right direction as law enforcement are now making an active effort to understand the signs and symptoms effecting PWMI as well as how to deescalate psychotic episodes. Additionally, CIT training has been found to increase access to mental health services as police officers are distributing more referrals for services rather than taking mentally ill offenders to jail.  As CIT efforts continue to spread across the country, hopefully the emphasis on sending low-level mentally ill offenders to mental health programs will decrease overcrowded jail populations and most importantly, provide PWMI with proper treatment. "
1321,"Hi Viviana,  Interesting post. I agree with your sentiments concerning the need for reconstruction within the justice system but, specifically the correctional system. As we heard in this week's lecture, jail diversion programs have begun to emerge that aim to put mentally ill offenders in contact with mental health services sooner and faster (Lecture 5-3). With this, to identify inmates with mental illness quicker, jails have attempted to incorporate a ""three-stage triage"" process for screening all inmates. However, due to underfunding and lack of staff this process is only feasible for larger jails (Lecture 5-4). Moreover, Torrey and colleagues (2010) emphasized that if state and federal legislations want to make lasting changes between PWMI and the criminal justice system, new and overlooked initiatives need to be further explored. Mentioned initiatives included, increased use of assisted outpatient treatment, expanding mental health courts, conduct randomized surveys every five years to account for the PWMI population in jails and prisons, shift state and county funds from the Department of Mental Health to the Department of Corrections and reform current mental health treatment laws (Torrey et al., 2010). "
1322,"Personally, I cannot say with certainty that risk assessment tools are completely ""fair"". However, I do believe they are still somewhat necessary in determining if an offender poses a threat to the rest of society. With that being said, due to the fact that risk assessment tools are not 100% accurate, such tools should be taken in moderation. Allocating too much weight to these assessments could land an offender in jail or prison for an unreasonable amount of time simply based on a probability. Thus, if such assessments are going to be used consistently, additional concrete factors contesting to an offenders overall improvement such as, school enrollment or regularly attending substance abuse meetings, need to be given a great amount of weight as well in determining an offenders risk. "
1323,"I believe mental health professionals would be receptive towards the main components the RNR approach focuses on. The RNR approach aims to provide correctional treatment to PWMI offenders that will hopefully divert them away from reentrance into the criminal justice system. RNR also aims to identify criminogenic risk factors affecting mentally ill offenders and attempts to provide services to minimize the occurrence of said risk factors. Putting emphasis on decreasing the amount of contact PWMI have with the criminal justice system seems like a goal mental health professionals could get behind, as it's being recognized more and more that the justice system is not best suited to properly serve the needs of PWMI. Additionally, identifying specific risk factors to single persons suffering from mental illness through the RNR model could help mental health professionals attack treatment needs faster. However, mental health professionals may be concerned with the possibility that once these PWMI are diverted from the criminal justice system, will their needs be attended to while in the community? Evidence has shown a lack of community resources allocated to PWMI once they are released from psychiatric supervision, as well as lack of sufficient funding for these resources (Slate et al., 2013). Thus, while criminal contact may be reduced, the emphasis on effective treatment and rehabilitation for PWMI while under community supervision may be a pressing concern for mental health professionals. "
1324,"Based on the presented video, I cannot say with certainty that probation is set up to address supervision and treatment of PWMI. However, I do believe probation department goals of ensuring offenders make behavioral changes and maintain stability are attributes that could benefit mentally ill offenders. Due to the significance of these goals, I'd assume if probation officials wanted to see behavioral changes in there mentally ill clients, they would assure that they have access to needed treatment and community resources. In comparison to jail efforts, treatment and supervision of mental illness under the care of probation may be more caring and individualized. I say this due to the fact that probation officers are assigned to certain amount of clients and are responsible for their success outside of jail walls, meaning catering to their needs is of higher importance. On the other hand, treatment and supervision of PWMI inside jails is often poor due to underfunding and overcrowding."
1325,"If I were a participant of a mental health court, I would definitely prefer the conditions and stipulations given under this court rather than those in traditional court proceedings. While some PWMI may be angered by the invasive treatment forced upon them, the treatment and benefits afforded to mentally ill offenders under these court proceedings are implemented with the intention to improve their lives and reduce recidivism. In comparison, traditional court proceedings do not hold such rehabilitative connotations, as they are more punitive driven. Moreover, under the mental health court system, at least I'd know judicial officials are more concerned about the improvement of my overall well-being and that my treatment needs are met. "
1326,"After reading the concerns noted in the Skeem et al. article (2015) in reference to the widely used RNR model, I would advise a Chief Probation Officer to tread lightly should they choose to implement this approach on PWMI under probation. Skeem et al. (2015) mentions that the key components of the RNR model that exclusively aim to guarantee public safety by reducing recidivism, jail duration and justice expenses among the mentally ill population are not conclusive and lacks substantial empirical data to support such methods. For example, RNR's focus to apply correctional treatment specifically to high-risk offenders in order to reduce overall recidivism was deemed premature by Skeem and colleagues as evidence supporting this risk principle was scarce. Further, Skeem and colleagues pointed to the notion that focusing on the criminogenic needs of mentally ill offenders can be problematic as ""mental illness"" itself could potentially be considered a risk factor when paired with other risk factors pertaining to violence, most notably substance abuse. Finally, the third principle on the RNR model, the ""responsivity principle"", which is focuses on intervention through cognitive and behavioral learning strategies to help offenders learn and change, was also found by Skeem et al. (2015) to lack empirical support in reference to the mentally population.  Therefore, due to a great lack of empirical support for the RNR model, I would encourage the Chief Probation Officer to utilize methods that emphasize the interpersonal relationships between probation officer and probationers, such as specialty probation programs. Specialty probation programs focus specifically on mentally ill probationers and contain smaller caseloads, continued officer training in mental health, officer coordination and direct involvement in their probationers' treatment plans and follow collaborative problem solving techniques (Skeem, Manchak & Montoya, 2017). Skeem and colleagues (2017) made a significant finding in that well executed specialty probation programs are effective in reducing overall recidivism among the mentally ill population. Moreover, in comparison to 32% of traditional probationers, the probability of ""no rearrest"" after 5 years of placement was 62% for specialty probationers (Skeem et al., 2017). Thus, the notion to establish genuine relationships with mentally ill probationers seems like a promising tactic towards the criminal justice's overall goal of public"
1327,"Hi Stephanie, Interesting post. It is evident in the Skeem et al. (2017) article that substance abuse has been credited as a general risk factor of violence. Moreover, the issue with the ""need principle"" under the RNR model is the fact that mental illness alone can also be considered a risk factor of violence. Skeem and colleagues point to this notion through other studies who have explored the relationship between violence and mental illness. For instance, the MacArthur Community Violence Study measured the prevalence of violence among approximately 1,000 persons discharged from a psychiatric hospital and compared results to about 500 persons in neighboring areas. Results indicated that while neither sample was said to have a substance abuse problem, issues with substance abuse raised the risk of violence among both groups. However, persons released from the psychiatric facility presented a significantly higher rate of violence in comparison to the neighboring sample (Skeem et al., 2017). Therefore, your point to encourage substance abuse counseling and monitoring for PWMI is well advised. Although, it is important to note that mental illness can be considered criminogenic when combined with other risk factors as well. Thus, overall reconstruction of the need principle may be necessary in regard to PWMI (Skeem et al., 2017). "
1328,"Sorry, all my citations actually refer to the Skeem et al. (2015) article not the 2017 article. My mistake!"
1329,"Hi Caroline,  I agree with your sentiments regarding the need for more research studying the mentally ill and non-mentally ill populations within the criminal justice system together and separately in order to effectively accomplish public safety goals (reduce recidivism). Additionally, you mentioned the need for reform concerning how probation departments deal with PWMI. Thankfully, strides have already been taken to accommodate the specific needs of PWMI under probation as Skeem et al. (2017) emphasizes the importance of ""specialized probation"". Specialized probation is specifically geared to the needs of mental ill probationers, and probation officers under this realm endure ongoing extensive training pertaining to mental health. Further, well implemented specialty probation programs have been deemed very useful in reducing overall recidivism among PWMI (Skeem et al., 2017). Thus, while you proposed the idea for probation departments to outsource and utilize professionals involved in forensic psychology, it is evident the ""regular"" probation officers are capable of adapting and learning new material in order to better serve specific populations."
1330,"The environment inside a prison is extremely isolating. Even though an inmate may be surrounded by others in similar situations, typically prison can feel extremely lonely and degrading. Moreover, in prison individuals become accustom to a specific routine enforced by guards and a warden, all decisions are now made for you and there is no sense of privacy. Additionally, as prisons across states vary, some prisons can be in worse shape than others in regard to maintenance and safety. Therefore, learning to adapt and survive under these conditions can really challenge and potentially diminish one's mental state. With that being said, PWMI may have an exceptionally harder time adapting to a prison environment as they already struggle with personal defects. As we've covered in previous models, attention afforded to mental health needs within the criminal justice system is extremely limited and more than likely neglected. Thus, a most likely isolating and hostile prison environment could definitely further aggravate symptoms associated with one's mental illness. Such agitation could potentially cause imprisoned PWMI to become depressed, have increased levels of anxiety, suicidal thoughts and put them in harms way with other inmates or guards due to their inability to control their behavior. "
1331,"Given the discussion in the video, it's evident that true rehabilitation is possible for prisoners with mental illness. However, to accomplish such a goal must be met with appropriate supervision of these individuals as they enter prison and upon release. As mentioned in the video, not allocating resources for ex-prisoners with mental illness only reverts them back to square one and could potentially land them back in incarceration. In addition, in order for true rehabilitation to be achieved, prisons need to focus more on ""what can be done to help these individuals"" instead of solely on punitive tactics. The goal of prisons dealing with PWMI should be to assure these individuals upon release can effectively integrate back into society and avoid police contact. Thus, if initiatives tackling life-skill coaching upon release, how to responsibly deal with one's emotions without resorting to anger or how appropriately interact socially with others were afforded to mentally ill prisoners and medication was taken regularly (if needed), I believe there's a good chance true rehabilitation can be reached. "
1332,"In regard to maintaining order and control over inmates behaviors, I understand why the punishment of solitary confinement is implemented. However, I believe extended periods of solitary confinement (more than 2 weeks) of prisoners loses its purpose of reinforcing authority as prisoners confined to such isolation begin to slowly lose touch with reality after about 10 days, as did the narrator did in the video. If anything, long periods of solitary confinement could potentially lead to onset mental illness as the brain loses nourishment day by day due to extremely confined and low activity. Therefore, personally, the disadvantages associated with an inmate under these conditions greatly overshadows the advantages of this punitive tactic. "
1333,"After watching the video, I'm not too upset about my tax dollars being used to treat mentally ill persons in prisons only because I'm aware of how in need this population is of services and resources. More needs to be done concerning the treatment of PWMI in prison, and simply utilizing prescription medication does not and should not suffice. However, I do agree with Evan's concerns, stating that state's irresponsibility to distribute mental health care funds effectively has led them to this point. Moreover, as mentioned in the video, if states are going to raise taxes in order to accommodate the imprisoned mentally ill population, more resources need to be afforded to PWMI outside of prison in order to ensure true rehabilitation and decrease criminal justice contact. Thus, hopefully doing so decreases taxpayer amounts due to PWMI successfully integrating back into society, simultaneously decreasing the need for increased treatment in prisons. "
1334,"In order to meet the treatment needs of mentally ill prisoners and ensure the safety of other inmates and staff while simultaneously keeping costs low, states need to make better use of their funds allocated to mental health services. With that being said, states should focus on implementing and funding more community based mental health resources to ensure PWMI maintain consistency with treatment regiments which could include medication as well as group therapy and life-skill classes dedicated to teaching PWMI how to effectively function within society (Lecture 7-2). Focusing funds on creating sufficient community based programs could potentially decrease the chance of PWMI coming in contact with the criminal justice system. Hence, if PWMI are able to successfully live and reintegrate among society, its possible states may not have to put so much money towards mental health services in prisons, as the mentally ill population of inmates should reflect a decrease in numbers. Conversely, assertive community treatment (ACT) programs have been proven to greatly benefit the wellbeing of PWMI in community settings but, research states that funding this initiative across the country would be extremely pricey (Slate et al., 2003). Thus, it makes more sense to guarantee the treatment of as many PWMI as possible through community outreach programs rather than provide exceptional care to only an exclusive amount of PWMI.  Further on this topic, prisoners suffering from mental illness should definitely be afforded more resources than other inmates. PWMI in prisons are a highly vulnerable population that require extensive care. On average, prisoners with mental illness propose an increased amount of challenges to themselves and prison staff in comparison to other inmates (Slate et al., 2003; Lecture 7-3). Moreover, challenges and victimization against this population persist due to understaffing, inadequate screenings of mental illness, lack of specialized treatment and so forth (Slate et al., 2003). Therefore, it's crucial that this special population of inmates receives additional resources in order to increase the probability of true rehabilitation and success on the outside.    Slate, R. N., Buffington-Vollum, J. K., & Johnson, W. W. (2003). The Criminalization of Mental Illness: Crisis and Opportunity for the Justice System, Second Edition. 443."
1335,"Hi Jennifer, Great post! I agree with your sentiments exactly. While implementing additional training efforts for officers and accommodating more specialized staff for inmates with mental illness will be expensive, I also believe fast action in these areas will eventually greatly reduce state costs on housing mentally ill prisoners. By accommodating to the needs of mentally ill prisoners now, we minimize the possibility of criminal justice contacts and possible recidivism later. Additionally, another area of concern I focused on in particular and is also key to the environmental change strategies mentioned in Adams and Ferrandino (2008) is the necessity of ""aftercare"" once inmates are released from the program and reenter society. One of the most essential factors for guaranteeing PWMI are successful once they integrate back in society is to assure they adhere to discharge planning goals. Thus, community based programs on the ""outside"" also need to be enforced to maximize the success rate of previously incarcerated PWMI.    Adams, K., & Ferrandino, J. (2008). Managing Mentally Ill Inmates in Prisons. Criminal Justice and Behavior, 35(8), 913–927. https://doi.org/10.1177/0093854808318624"
1336,"Hi Suz,  You hit all the marks in your post, investing in additional treatment resources for mentally ill inmates inside and outside of prison walls is a risk our country has to take if they want to decrease expenses allocated to mental health services in the future. However, in regard to the use of medication on this vulnerable population, I do not believe further implementation is necessary as prisons already heavily rely on medication to deal with mentally ill prisoners. With that being said, emphasis on the initiatives mentioned by Adams and Ferrandino (2008) concerning therapeutic environments should be given more consideration while psychotropic medications, yet still exercised, should be administered with restraints. I come to this conclusion due to the fact that officers not properly trained in dealing with PWMI have been found to  utilize medication in order to sedate prisoners not rehabilitate them (Slate et al., 2003). Though, this indication alone further supports the need for additional resources for this continuously mistreated population. "
1337,"After viewing the video, as a Missouri taxpayer I would be happy to know my annual contributions are coming to fruition. If America wants to see true change in the mental ill community, we have to do our part to help this population that cannot single-handedly help themselves. The reconstruction of the Fulton State Hospital was long overdue as the previous hospital had been standing since 1851. As research evolves concerning the treatment of PWMI, facilities and it's workers need to reflect such changes in the practice. Therefore, if that means a new hospital needs to be created in order to reach and treat more PWMI effectively, society should be on board with the idea as it signifies real change and the state taking an active role to appropriately help this population. "
1338,"I believe utilizing the defense of NGRI can be seen in two ways depending on the facts of the case. On one hand, due to NGRI laws being different by state, some offenders may have an easier time using such a defense if the law of the state is lax. On the other hand, a lot of offenders who have committed mass shootings or murders try to utilize this defense in effort to escape their wrongdoings, in cases such as these I do believe the NGRI defense is used to escape prison bars. However, what such offenders may fail to realize is that they will most likely never see outside again as they will serve the maximum of the their most serious offense in a hospital. Thus, while those deemed NGRI may dodge the jail or prison environment, they're still not ""getting off"" or ""free"" in that sense. "
1339,"To ensure the best patient and staff safety in state hospitals while still providing treatment, it may help to increase security within the hospitals. While this is a treatment facility, one has to remember that some of the state's most violent mentally disordered offenders reside in these facilities and therefore, staff have to be protected appropriately. Moreover, as mental health staff are trained to deal with these patients, as seen in the video, episodes frequently arise where mental health staff is put in harms way. Thus, further training regarding how to deal with patients who undergo these episodes of aggression and violence  (such as de-escalation tactics) needs to be administered. Further, specific procedures focused on how to guarantee the safety of both parties need to be explored as well. Additionally, extensive treatment needs to be afforded to patients who have these violent outbreaks in an attempt to teach them how to control their anger and learn techniques for calming down. If such avenues of deescalation and increased treatment do not work to calm violent patients, I believe sedation would be the last resort in order to prevent staff from being abused and brutalized. "
1340,"After watching the video, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has some promising evidence for dealing with mood disorders in the future. However, due to the procedure still being highly experimental and great variation in overall success among patients, this procedure is far from being universally accepted. Although, stories such as Eddie's shows that DBS does in fact work to curve depressive thoughts. Though, research needs to be furthered on how these electrodes are truly affecting the brain and if such electric stimulation is reliable and targets what its intended to target (Area 25). "
1341,"In regard to the role state hospitals should play within the criminal justice system, I believe their role is vital for determining if certain criminal defenses such as ""not guilty by reason of insanity"" (NGRI) are valid and should be deemed an acceptable defense by the court. Additionally, their role in restoring competency in offenders classified by the court as incompetent to stand trial (IST) is also significant to criminal proceedings. Those staffed by these state hospitals, nurses and mental health practitioners, who screen, assess and treat these offenders are essential to a judges' decision to further criminal court proceedings or continue further treatment. Therefore, state hospitals active participation in the criminal justice system should remain to ensure legal decisions over persons with possible mental illness are done accurately, through applicable research and valid assessments. However, while forensic patients (those found to be NGRI, IST, etc.) occupy the majority of beds in state facilities at 90%  (Lecture 8-3), I do not suggest they should exclusively cater to this population. Catering predominately to forensic patients would severely neglect those civilly committed. With being said, those civilly committed are not referred due to criminal involvement, their referred because they're a heightened risk to themselves and others, a population that deserves specialized care as well.  Therefore, I find it more beneficial for state hospitals to create additional programs specifically focused on forensic patients. For example, California's Department of State Hospitals (DSH) is doing its part to service civil and forensic patients separately by incorporating jail-based (JBCT and AES) and community-based programs to restore competency back into offenders deemed IST (California DSH 2018 Annual Report, 2018). Further, California DSH is implementing community-based conditional release programs (CONREP) to treat and supervise IST patients as well as those considered NGRI, mentally disordered offenders and other parolees cleared for outpatient treatment. By implementing these programs, California is freeing up the number of beds overtaken by the forensic patient population and making room for other types of patients desperately in need of care.     The California Department of State Hospitals 2018 Annual Report. (2018). 16."
1342,"Hi Asia,  I enjoyed your post. Specifically I want to touch more on the points you made concerning the negative perceptions of state hospitals. As you mentioned, state hospitals were scrutinized for their prison-like environment and inability to properly care for patients due to an insufficient amount and quality of training among staff. Conversely, while these factors may have contributed to the closing of numerous state hospitals, the biggest factor was money. States no longer wanted to spend millions and billions of dollars on the upkeep of state hospitals. Thus, the push for community-based programs seemed like a great incentive and saved states money. However, closure of state hospitals actually landed many PWMI in nursing homes and general hospitals looking for treatment, which according to Sisti, Segal and Emanuel (2015) inadvertently cost even more money than before. Moreover, while state hospitals used to be shamed for their prison-like environment, its evident that prisons and jails are now considered the United States' biggest mental health facility (Sisti et al., 2015). With that being said, these points add to the discussion that the utilization of state hospitals may once again be needed as PWMI are still not receiving proper care. Although, it's more likely for outdated state hospitals to refurbished to accommodate new treatment and care research concerning PWMI.   Sisti, D. A., Segal, A. G., & Emanuel, E. J. (2015). Improving Long-term Psychiatric Care: Bring Back the Asylum. JAMA, 313(3), 243. https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2014.16088"
1343,"Hi Elise,  Great post. I agree with your sentiments as I also noted that state hospitals should not exclusively accommodate to forensic patients. In addition, I also concur that forensic patients should be handled separately from other patients (most likely those civilly committed) to assure resources are properly and evenly distributed to all patients in need. With that being said, California is currently aiming to do just that through jail-based, community-based and diversion programs specifically tailoring to forensic patients (California DSH 2018 Annual Report, 2018). California's efforts to restore IST and treat these forensic patients outside or before entering state hospitals frees room for other PWMI who are not criminally involved to be catered to as well. "
1344,"No, I do not believe the presented forms of data sharing are satisfactory for understanding the link between the criminal justice system, mental health system and their clients. The proposed forms of data sharing between agencies seems minimal at best, potentially only touching the surface of what patients may truly need in regard to treatment. Although, while the CJ system and the MH system do not have the best track record of working well with one another, increased understanding and contact needs to be exchanged in order to ensure patient ""red flags"" and needs are detected at initial entrance into either system. Moreover, while it's important to uphold confidentiality regulations and not put an individual's rights in danger, I believe both agencies should be able to access necessary information concerning an individual's past and current MH history and previous stops or convictions with law enforcement. Possibly a shared database could be utilized detailing such information, in order to ensure neither agency neglects or overlooks any details that may give better insight into the needed care of the PMWI or help law enforcement better handle PWMI detainees. However, the database should only be encouraged when CJ contact and MH contact are both initiated in order to preserve records until needed and eliminate potential preconceived notions about the patient/detainee. "
1345,"The training approach of CIT appears to be a lot more focused on the immediate needs of the disturbed individual. Based on the video, officers utilizing this approach seem to genuinely want to understand the overall circumstances affecting the individual's behavior and how they can best serve the individual's displayed issues. Officers seemed a lot more calm and reserved in their approach to communicate with the individual in comparison to other police videos I've witnessed where officers are on such high alert that they seem frantic and irrational in their decision making. Additionally, I'm pleased with the fact that the CIT approach has on-call services (CAN-Help) for the mentally ill and those who may be effected by the mentally ill person's actions. Incorporating such individualized services promotes the idea that not all PWMI interactions with police have to result in a hospital stay or going to jail. In reality, it may be as easy as taking the time to talk and actually listen to PWMI to ensure the best care and safest solution is provided. "
1346,"I believe it often takes a court order or other legal actions for departments of corrections to change the way PWMI are treated simply due to the fact that the issues facing PWMI are not taken seriously. Officers of jails and prisons constantly treat inmates with mental illness under the same conditions as they treat other inmates or possibly with even more force in an attempt to control their erratic behaviors. Likewise, as witnessed in other law enforcement scandals, real change in justice system procedures doesn't typically take place until public outcry or an abundance cases/lawsuits can no longer be ignored. Hence, why the SCDC only began to take action once lawsuits against the department were outrageous and caused public backlash, even though it was disclosed that the SCDC new for years that mentally ill inmates were receiving inadequate treatment. "
1347,"While mental health providers displayed in the video detailed positive experiences dealing with PMWI within a correctional environment, I believe the vast majority of mental health workers may have initial difficulties when dealing with mentally ill inmates. Depending on the temperament of the inmate, the mental health worker may have trouble initially getting the inmate to open up and discuss their mental illness, as they have not developed any sense of trust with the worker. Mental health providers may also be faced with the challenge of ensuring their patients are properly treated for their mental illness due to the fact that treatment for PMWI in corrections is not sufficient. In addition, cross-training with correctional agencies may be beneficial to mental health providers in that providers will gain a better understanding of what and where jail/prison procedures need to the altered to best accommodate PWMI needs. Also, cross-training concerning community corrections and protocols may be beneficial towards identifying the best possible sources of outpatient community care for PWMI upon release. "
1348,"The implementation of Crisis Intervention Training (CIT) is becoming a growing preferred method in dealing with PWMI who come in contact with the criminal justice system. As described in the Watson and Fulambarker (2013) article, the CIT model is a community task force intertwined with law enforcement and mental health providers that aim to increase the safety of all persons involved in crisis situations surrounding a person with mental illness. Additionally, another main goal of all professionals involved is to divert PWMI from the criminal justice system to the mental health system, where they can receive appropriate care that law enforcement officials are not equipped to provide. Moreover, while the interaction between law enforcement and mental health professionals is considered distant and the two spectrums tend to clash, under the CIT module the two systems must feed off one another in order to provide the best implementation of the module possible and best serve the PWMI population. The required 40 hours of specialized training for this volunteer task force focuses on; the signs and symptoms of mental illness, developmental disabilities, mental health treatment, co-occurring disorders and potential legal issues and de-escalation techniques (Watson & Fulambarker, 2013). While these specialized training sessions are headed by police trainers and consumers and family advocates, the instruction headed by mental health providers is essential towards officers' comprehension of how to deal with PWMI in crisis situations safely and effectively. Moreover, in the mist of disturbance calls involving a mentally ill individual, law enforcement and mental health providers join forces to defuse such incidences of crisis. For instance, in the Lecture 9.2 video, after officers thoroughly analyzed the situation at hand by simply creating meaningful dialogue with the mentally ill individual, officer's offered additional mental health support services that could better aid the individual's needs. The video demonstrates that instead of apprehending the disturbed individual, law enforcement officials found it better suited to utilize their mental health counterparts. This new found partnership among systems through the use of the CIT module fosters a new level of respect and understanding as both systems work together to accomplish the same goal in regard to PWMI.    Watson, A. C., & Fulambarker, A. J. (201"
1349,"Hi Liisa,  I agree, the mental health system and the criminal justice system would greatly benefit from learning similar trainings in regard to PWMI. Personally, I noted that CIT training would be the most influential training tool for both systems as it forces the two to co-exist and find common ground in order to develop the most effective crisis intervention possible that keeps officers and PWMI safe. Separately, I enjoyed your idea to encourage training sessions on stigma and cultural competency. I believe mental health providers would be extremely significant in debunking law enforcements biases against PWMI as they learn more about the signs, symptoms and how to react to calls of service dealing with this population. Moreover, the use of cultural competency training would be beneficial for both systems as PWMI come from all types of demographic backgrounds and therefore all variations need to be analyzed for better comprehension. "
1350,"Hi Briana,  Great post. I also found the CIT module the most significant training technique afforded to the criminal justice system and mental health system. Under this model, both systems share the same goal of redirecting PWMI who have had contact with police to mental health resources instead of jail or prison. In addition, I wanted to touch on your sentiments regarding the way officers refer PWMI to treatment opportunities. You mentioned that the only way officers refer mentally ill individuals to treatment is through a 5150 hold. However, I do not believe this notion stands any longer. With the implementation of the CIT model, officers are now being trained to offer PWMI's in crisis additional mental health resources, separate from a hospital visit. In fact, some mental health services will make home-visits to check on the status of the PWMI and any other persons that may have been involved in the previous crisis. Additionally, these mobile-services offer counseling and potential treatment avenues. "
1351,"I assume the Fairfax department pays significant focus to nonviolent offenders due to the fact that they are less likely to be combative and more likely to smoothly cooperate with police instruction in comparison to violent offenders. The probability for violent offenders to become erratic is higher than those incarcerated for a nonviolent offense. However, violent offenders with mental illness should be overlooked. PWMI who have committed violent offenses should also be assessed for their mental illness so officers are aware of inmates conditions and how to act accordingly, serving also as precautionary measure for police safety. With that being said, treatment should be still be provided to violent offenders but on stricter terms. Additionally, the Fairfax department probably aims attention at nonviolent offenders due to the fact that a great amount of PWMI cycled through the criminal justice system are arrested for nonviolent offenses such as substance abuse and property crimes. Therefore, it makes sense to put more focus on the larger population of ill treated offenders at hand (nonviolent) than the small amount of PWMI who commit violent offenses. "
1352,"With such a low percentage of PWMI that may be violent (3-5% as indicated in the lecture), I do not think it would be beneficial to have a national registry of individuals with mental illness for the purpose of reducing gun violence.  Such a list would only serve to create more of a stigma regarding mental illness and wrongfully label PWMI as being at risk for violence.  Amassing a list of people with mental illness would be a costly endeavor with little to no benefit.  Money would be better spent on educating people about PWMI and about the greater risk of PWMI harming themselves rather than others."
1353,"Deinstitutionalization resulted in the release of PWMI back into the community which consequently has  contributed to the growing homeless population.  However, homelessness is just part of the problem.  The bigger challenge is the lack of mental health services.  Without available mental health services in the community, PWMI will continue to struggle, regardless of whether or not they have a place to live.  I believe we need to move away from just looking at this as a housing issue because if we do, the solution will bring us full-circle to housing PWMI (i.e. institutionalization) without the provision of needed mental health services.  "
1354,"Across centuries, theories about the basis of mental illness has often undermined self-determination among the mentally ill, creating doubt that persons with mental illness could function on their own in society. Blaming mental illness on biological or other extraneous factors encouraged the belief that a person suffering from mental illness could not be responsible for his/her own behavior.  The biological perspective began in the Pre- and Ancient Civilization eras and later emerged in America in the 19 th and early 20 th centuries with the biological determinism movement and given new evidence that a link existed between the brain and behavior.  Beliefs that demonology was the root of mental illness surfaced in the Middle Ages, with religious institutions, along with government, involved in the regulation of the mentally ill through spiritual salvation and church rituals, often resulting in torture and execution. Self-determination of the mentally ill continued to be challenged in the Renaissance period with the emergence of institutions for the confinement of the mentally ill and in the following Age of Enlightenment with The Great Confinement—the movement to confine the mentally ill along with criminals and the homeless. Even in the Pre-Civil War era when the view of mental illness had changed to one of immorality, the mentally ill continued to be warehoused in asylums and often incarcerated in jails.  The trend of removing the mentally ill from society continued well into the 20 th century with support for committing the mentally ill against their will into state hospitals, a consequence of involuntary confinement and parent patriae laws. The movement to hand over some self-determination control to the mentally ill began in the 1960s with the Anti-Psychiatry Movement, which opposed the authoritarian nature of psychiatry, the Civil Rights Movement, which called for limits to involuntary hospitalization, and the Action for Mental Health, which recommended community-based treatment for the mentally ill.  Deinstitutionalization was another positive movement toward self-determination for PWMI, but continuing to support having PWMI as full-fledged members of society requires the sustainability of available and reliable mental health services in the community (I do not believe we are there yet)."
1355,"Hi Alyse, I really like your very thoughtful perspective.  It is interesting that you jump back to Ancient Civilization as an example of how an emphasis on community and family can result in more autonomy and self-determination for PWMI.  From that point on (and there we are talking centuries), self-determination among PWMI has continuously been sabotaged by society's efforts to keep ""undesirables"" locked up, for fear they are possessed with evil spirits or violent. A great argument for a new (yet old) perspective on promoting self-determination among PWMI  and a great argument for the study of history (we really can learn from past history!)."
1356,"Hi Jennifer, I agree that the need to ""hide"" the mentally ill away from the community will persist until people are better educated about mental illness and the individuals that suffer from it.  As you indicate, we are not where we need to be in terms of educating people. I also believe that, regardless of what people know about mental illness, they generally are afraid of PWMI.  Take, for example, a homeless person on the street walking around talking to himself.  I would guess that the average person would be afraid of that person.  Therefore, in addition to educating the general public about mental illness, I think it is imperative that we have sustainable and reliable mental health services in the community that PWMI have access to."
1357," To effectively eliminate stigma related to PWMI, efforts need to be made to better inform the public about mental illness.  For example, research should be shared as to the reality of the relationship between mental illness and violence (i.e. most violent acts are not committed by PWMI).  I especially believe it would be helpful to inform the media that highlighting unique negative stories about PWMI only serves to enforce stigma and results in additional detrimental effects for this population."
1358,Reducing mental health care policy sends a message that PWMI are not valued.  The video put it best when comparing available mental health care compared to medical care for cancer patients; the public would be in an uproar if the level of care for cancer patients was as low as the level of care for PMWI.  There is so much stigma associated with PWMI that they are considered unworthy of care. 
1359,"It would be extremely beneficial for the military to encourage individuals to get to know and talk with other service members in various stages of military service before joining, while on active duty and after active service.  As the army infantryman indicated in the video, talking with and sharing experiences with other service members would help individuals to not to feel alone in their experiences."
1360,"It should be allowed, on a case-by-case basis, for someone, most likely a professional (not sure I would say ""society""), to step in and mandate treatment when it is determined that an individual is a danger to him-/herself or others.  I believe it would especially apply to young adults who may not be mature enough to make decisions about their own health and welfare."
1361,"To obtain more information about the most useful delivery and content of mental health education for primary school children, Cooke, King and Greenwood (2016) conducted a qualitative study involving 15 teachers in London and Brighton with experience teaching children ages seven to 11.  The researchers were interested in finding out if and how these teachers might talk to and educate students about mental health issues.  Due to teacher fears (e.g. fear of parent complaints, giving out incorrect information, triggering emotions in children), beliefs (e.g. about mental health and their professional role and responsibilities) and behaviors (e.g. safety and avoidance behaviors), teachers rarely had discussions with students about mental health.  The researchers considered that little to no communication about mental health may be reinforcing the notion that discussing mental health issues is taboo.  Therefore, the study supports the need to include mental health discussions in the classroom and that teachers are best-suited (rather than outside providers) to lead these discussions and would need to receive appropriate training.  The study also concluded that the best approach for educating primary school students to prevent mental health stigma would be to talk to students about how mental health problems can affect everyone, eliminating the perception that only select individuals have mental illness.  Two other studies (Milin et al., 2016; Wahl et al., 2019) addressed increasing knowledge and understanding of mental illness among high school students for the purpose of eliminating associated stigma.  The Wahl and associates study (2019) included students in grades nine and 10 from 10 high schools in five U.S. states—Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois and Texas.  Students in the test group were shown the National Alliance on Mental Illness Ending the Silence (NAMI ETS) presentation which included facts about mental illness among youth and the importance of reducing stigma.  An assessment was designed to measure student knowledge and attitudes about youth with mental illness.  The assessment was administered to the test group prior to, immediately after and within four to six weeks following the NAMI ETS presentation.  Students in the control group did not view the NAMI ETS presentation but completed an assessment.  Test group students showed significant positive changes in mental health knowledge and attitudes from pre- to post-presentation, demo"
1362,"Hi Nicolle, I really enjoyed reading your post.  Your suggestions by age group are very thoughtful.  I agree that curriculum should vary by age group based on some studies that I found (see below). A study addressing mental health education in primary schools concluded that the best approach for educating primary school students to prevent mental health stigma would be to talk to students about how mental health problems can affect everyone, eliminating the perception that only select individuals have mental illness (Cooke, King & Greenwood, 2016).  Studies of high school students (Milin et al., 2016; Wahl et al., 2019) found that the students knowledge, understanding and attitudes about mental illness improved after being presented facts about mental illness and the importance of reducing stigma.

1363,"Hi Georgie, I appreciate your thoughtful response to Carolyn's post.  I strongly agree with you that parent education is vital.  Even though kids are getting information at school regarding mental illness for the purpose of reducing related stigma, it will not be effective if they go home and hear a parent say ""that lady is crazy and needs to be locked up!""  Parents need to be aware that statements like that reinforce the stigmas.  Also, I came across a few articles indicating the impact that teachers may have on their students' attitudes about mental health.  In one study, interviewed teachers indicated that the did not feel comfortable speaking about mental illness for fear that parents would complain or that they would give out incorrect information.  The researchers concluded that by avoiding discussions about mental illness may actually reinforce the notion that talking about mental issues is taboo (Cooke, King & Greenwood, 2016).  The studies I read indicate that teachers may be best-suited to lead discussions about mental health with students, so what they know or say or don't know or say (like parents) is vital.  "
1364,"Hi Carolyn, Thank you for sharing your experience.  It's always very interesting and helpful when our fellow students add in their personal experiences on a particular topic.  I agree that breaking stigmas is a very difficult endeavor.  The mental illness stigma is especially enduring in the Asian and Hispanic cultures.  When parents and family members hold onto these stigmas, even education efforts at school may not be successful.  So we have to expand education throughout the educational system (teachers and staff) and into the community."
1365,"In regard to civil commitment, a false negative would lead you to  not commitment someone when they likely should be committed, which would be a more of a risk to society.  In the case of a false positive, the individual would be committed but would likely  not need to be committed.  The latter decision would put the individual, rather than society, more at risk."
1366,"For the good of society, if you do not want to miss committing individuals that should be committed, you want your civil commitment standards to have higher sensitivity.  However, with higher sensitivity, specificity is lowered.  In this latter case, you will likely commit individuals that do not need to be committed, which may, in the long run, be detrimental to those individuals."
1367,"I do not believe that involuntary commitment of sex offenders after they have completed their sentence should be mandatory.  If a criminal court has sentenced a sex offender for a particular length of time and that sex offender has served his/her sentence, it seems unjust to then add on another sentence of involuntary commitment, at least without a determination that the individual is at risk of sexual recidivism.  Often there are no limits to the length of civil commitment so the individual could end up spending a majority of his/her life being involuntarily committed, and most likely in a custodial-type environment.  Any type of commitment can be anti-therapeutic and stigmatizing, resulting in a lower quality of life.  Not adding an involuntary commitment after time-served would be a good idea for the individual but would still be considered a bad idea in society's eyes."
1368,"I believe that inpatient commitment, as opposed to outpatient commitment, is the larger reach of state authority into an individual's liberty since there is a greater likelihood of being able to enforce inpatient commitment than outpatient commitment; it is difficult to keep track of individuals out in the community.  Additionally, there seems to be more control in the process of getting an individual committed to an inpatient facility than in releasing them out into the community.  In a way, however, this control (and what some may see as a violation of an individual's liberty) can be helpful for PWMI who may not be able to help themselves."
1369,"The cons of inpatient and outpatient involuntary commitment are similar; both are considered coercive, anti-therapeutic, stigmatizing, discriminatory and heavily reliant on available funding.  The mere label of “involuntary” is descriptive enough.  With involuntary commitment, the court orders or coerces an individual to participate in a treatment plan and/or take medication.  Forcing treatment or medication can be anti-therapeutic in that is creates an adversarial relationship between a clinicians and his/her patient, often resulting in patient noncompliance.  Locking people up in mental institutions also sends the message that PWMI are dangerous, perpetuating existing mental illness stigma.  Negative responses associated with such stigma can affect individuals ordered for outpatient treatment since they are more visible to the public.  There is also evidence of racial discrimination in involuntary commitment with a greater portion of Black males receiving more severe diagnoses.  (However, Swanson and associates [2009)] argue that any racial disparities are due to data being collected from a population where Blacks are overrepresented.)  The last con is that both inpatient and outpatient involuntary commitment is highly dependent on available funding.  For example, when there was funding for mental health institutions, more beds were available and filled.  As funding decreased, so did the capacity to offer mental health facilities and services.  Consequently, funding, rather than need, determines who can and cannot receive mental health services and this can be detrimental to individuals and/or public safety.   The pros differ somewhat for inpatient versus outpatient involuntary commitment.  Since inpatient commitment takes PWMI off the street and into mental health facilities, it is considered a plus for society in terms of public safety.  Take, for example, the Virginia Tech shooter.  Had the system worked and he was involuntarily committed, the shooting may never have occurred.  Another pro to inpatient commitment is that it reduces criminalization of PWMI and helps those that cannot survive in the community out on their own because of their mental illness. Outpatient commitment can be beneficial in that it is the least restrictive option and allows for an individual to remain in the community while still receiving needed mental health services.  Outpatient commitment gives an individual the opportunity to experience mental h"
1370,"Hi Elise, I like you suggestion for having a clinical/forensic psychologist asses the patient before, during and after treatments.  If the purpose of the assessments are to determine effectiveness of treatment, what would you suggest should be measured in the assessments at the three points in time?"
1371,"Hi Bobbie, I agree that it would be difficult to measure the success of commitment if we do not have an understanding the goal.  You make a great point that society’s goal may be just to hide away PWMI.  I think there is a lot of truth to that. I also agree with you that success would be to have PWMI out living as a functioning member of the community.  Below is a similar suggestion I included in my post:  Level of functioning can be determined through educational, employment and social outcome data.  For example, a normal-functioning individual would likely be able to reach an educational and/or employment milestone such as getting a high school diploma or GED, completing vocational training and/or holding down a steady job.  Social functioning can be assessed through qualitative interviews with family, friends and co-workers."
1372,"Hi Dr. Turner, I am familiar with PowerPoint but not Zoom."
1373,I believe the most difficult stage for PWMI would be during Prosecution/Pre-Trial since this is where PWMI would have to understand their charges and appear at a preliminary hearing.   A person with mental issues may find it difficult to process this information and would not likely understand it well enough to make an informed decision as to whether they should plead guilty or not.  The criminal justice system is complicated and intimidating which can be overwhelming for someone who is suffering from mental health issues.
1374,"PWMI, who often fall into the category of non-violent offenders, would end up in county jail instead of state prison.  Compared to prison, county jails are relatively more focused on rehabilitation and offer mental health services through county health care agencies which would be beneficial to PWMI.  However, one concern would be that, once at the local level, non-violent PWMI may be released into the community where there is less availability of mental health services."
1375,"I'm not sure if ""fair"" an appropriate way to describe law enforcement's first-responder role in situations involving PWMI.  Rather, police, having had specialized training regarding the mentally ill and experience with interacting with PWMI, would be a better choice as first responders with PWMI in crises.  Since their primary role is to protect the public, police have the necessary skills and experience to assess situations and ensure the safety of not only the PWMI  but also the general public.  Many times,  the reason a PWMI comes to the attention of authorities is because he/she is causing a disturbance in public.  The presence of a uniformed police officer in such a situation would be more reassuring to the public than a mental health professional who would be less identifiable."
1376," With CIT, officers receive training about mental illness and experience what it is like to interact with PWMI through contact with consumers of mental health services and/or in role-playing situations.   Having first-hand experience with PWMI is likely to dispel some of the stigma associated with mental illness among these officers.  If a CIT-trained law enforcement officer in the field is able to de-escalate a situation with a PWMI while the public is watching (actively or through media reports), this will also help eliminate mental illness stigma among the public."
1377,"The meta-analysis by Taheri (2016) studying the relationship between CIT usage and arrests and officer safety found no significant effects of CIT on arrest outcomes or use of force.  As concluded by Taheri (2016), these findings do not invalidate the use of CIT. I agree that these findings should not disrupt the use of CIT but they do highlight the variance and extent of officer encounters with PWMI in crises.  Morobito et al. (2012) argued that CIT training would not eliminate the use of force because more force is warranted in some situations to ensure the safety of all involved parties.  In their study of the Chicago Police Department CIT program, Morobito and associates focused on other factors that would necessitate the use of force.  The researchers found that subject demeanor and resistance influenced officer use of force with PWMI; as the subject’s demeanor and resistance increased, so did the need to use force.  More importantly, however, the researchers found that CIT-trained officers were likely to respond with less force than those officers with no CIT training. Pelfrey and Young (2019) argued that CIT officers often are faced with the most difficult law enforcement situations, having to engage with unpredictable individuals experiencing psychological stress.  In these cases, even CIT-trained officers must use force, especially if their safety or the safety of others is at risk.  In the Pelfrey and Young (2019) study, CIT officers confirmed that CIT assignments often included a higher likelihood of using force but the officers also indicated that the de-escalation techniques they learned as part of the CIT training was an invaluable alternative to use of force, offering them extra time to secure help from fellow police officers. The more important and relevant finding by Taheri (2016) was that officers trained in CIT, as compared to non-CIT officers, were more likely to refer PWMI to community-based resources than arrest them.  CIT is a beneficial approach because it educates officers about mental health issues and resources which often results in better decisions and outcomes for PWMI (Pelfrey & Young, 2019).  Additionally, a better understanding of PWMI and the challenges that they face can also reduce stigma associated with mental illness. Based on this information, I would support the continued use of the CIT model.  I believe there is enough evidence demonstrating the benefits of CIT training and I wo"
1378,"Hi Wendy, I was also disappointed to find that Taheri did not find any significant effects of CIT on use of force or arrest outcomes.  Other related research that I found (Morobito et al., 2012; Pelfrey & Young, 2019) indicated that officers faced with the unpredictability of PWMI often find it necessary to use force with PWMI for their safety or the safety of others involved.  Therefore, CIT would not eliminate use of force. In terms of arrest outcomes, I found another study (Kubiak et al., 2017) where officers indicated they were unsure about taking a PWMI to a hospital because they were concerned that the individual would only receive temporary care when they needed extended care.  The officers were also concerned about vulnerable individuals that were unable to meet their basic needs (e.g. housing, food). I believe that future CIT research needs to recognize and measure these additional factors related to the use of force and arrest outcomes with PWMI so we can get a better idea about what is driving police decisions related to PWMI.

1379,"Hi Elise, I agree that it's disappointing to hear that PWMI are disproportionately incarcerated.  I believe that we need more research so we can better understand why this is happening.  In a study by Kubiak and associates (2017), the researchers found that officers were were unsure about taking a PWMI to a hospital because they were concerned that the individual would only receive temporary care when they needed extended care.  The officers were also concerned about vulnerable individuals that were unable to meet their basic needs (e.g. housing, food).  Given this information, it may be that officers believe that taking PWMI into custody would be in the best interest of the individual.  Or, maybe these officers are not well-informed.  Whatever the case, we need to have a better understanding of what motivates an officer to take a PWMI into custody as opposed to referring the individual to community treatment services.   In my research work with juveniles on probation here in OC, I find that juveniles have better access to mental health services while in custody.  Juveniles are less likely to adhere to treatment when out in the community.  So we have to weigh the pros and cons of treatment versus incarceration.  We can see why this becomes a difficult decision for law enforcement.

1380,"I believe that a PWMI who becomes a ""frequent flyer"" in the criminal justice system will begin to feel hopeless and confused.  It's a revolving door where he/she is taken in off the streets and incarcerated and then released back into the community.  A PWMI re-entering and exiting that many times is obviously not getting needed mental health services while in jail or out in the community.  "
1381,"1. Self-report of mental health issues, symptoms, diagnosis (e.g. suicidal thoughts, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, etc.) 2. Prior history - prior criminal justice system involvement; prior mental health treatment (individual/group/collateral counseling, medications); history of suicide attempts or self-harm; history of substance use/abuse 3. Observations from family members and by mental health professions and staff at jails I think it is important to gather data from several sources to try to get a complete picture of the individual.  Sometimes more can be learned through observation."
1382,"The rights of jail inmates as described in the video seem fair and reasonable - right to free speech, freedom of religion and freedom of expression.  These rights should be protected as long as doing so does not risk the safety of inmates or other jail staff.  Upholding an inmates constitutional rights (i.e. right of due process, 8th Amendment) is also fair.  Inmates also should have the right to be protected while incarcerated (e.g. right to privacy, anti-prison-rape law) and the right to heath care (physical and mental)."
1383,"Hi Denise, I believe that inmates' rights as explained in video (i.e. free speech, religion, expression, constitutional rights, basic human rights) should be protected but I agree that individuals in jails are afforded many more rights while incarcerated than the average person (which, by the way, we pay for).  I see it too in juvenile probation where youth in custody are getting additional education and employment resources (and field trips) not available to youth out in the community who have never been arrested.  I believe the problem is that some of these youth believe they have a ""right"" to these services and programs."
1384,I think medicating PWMI in jails is considered a less time- and staff-involved solution.  Often jails do not have enough staff to monitor the general population and oversee PWMI who may act out and cause disturbances or who may be at risk of harming themselves.  Medications can be used to mask symptoms so PWMI are less anxious and more manageable.
1385,"I believe the use of jails for the seriously mentally ill is inappropriate.  According to the textbook, jailing individuals with mental health illness is expensive and even more than the cost of community-based mental health treatment. Consider the example of the man who, suffering from mental illness, was picked up and put in jail for not being able to pay an $80 cab fare and for failure to appear for a court date.  His mother, a board member of NAMI, asks if the cost of jailing her son for those offenses is fair to taxpayers.  I would say “no” and further argue that putting this man in jail would do him more harm than good.  The best option would be to divert him from jail and into a community-based treatment program, court-ordered if needed. Aside from the higher costs associated with using jails for the seriously mentally ill, the conditions of jail—the chaos associated with overcrowding, unsanitary conditions and lack of privacy—can make persons with serious mental illness even more anxious and troubled.  Jails also often lack mental health services and enough appropriate mental health staff to handle mentally ill inmates.  In addition, jail officers are the first point of contact for all inmates and are primarily tasked with maintaining safety and security in the jail.  As such, these officers often lack the training and time needed to effectively communicate with and handle seriously mentally ill inmates. The changes in the number and composition of jail inmates as the result of the Public Safety Realignment Act also created an even more challenging environment for PWMI in the jails.  Due to the Realignment Act, some non-serious, non-violent and non-sexual offenders were re-directed from serving their sentences in state prison to county jail (Lofstrom, Bird, & Martin, 2016).  These changes affected PWMI in that the jails soon became overcrowded and PWMI had to share housing with more felony inmates serving longer sentences.  In addition to overcrowding causing distress to PWMI, having more inmates with more serious offenses added challenges for jail officers in an already overtaxed jail system.  The resulting strain on jail resources made it nearly impossible to find additional funding to support mental health services in the jail.  One somewhat positive outcome from the Realignment Act was that, having to keep the number of jail inmates at or below capacity, jails may have had to turn away or reduce sentencing for PWMI who ar"
1386,"Hi Caroline, Thank you for your very thoughtful post.  Like Elise, I found your suggestion for reform with the mentally ill in mind very interesting.  I appreciate your further recommendations that funding should come from both state and federal agencies.  Working at OC Probation, I see the impact that realignment has made on local counties and I would really like to see state and fed agencies take back some responsibility.  I think working on mental health reform should be in their court.   Great post!"
1387,"Hi Viviana, I agree that PWMI should have access to more diversion programs and treatment.  Unfortunately there continues to be a lack of mental health services available in local communities to divert PWMI to.  Also, even if alternative means of treatment are available, adherence to treatment will still be an issue, and more so with PWMI out in the community.  There is a ways to go with community-based treatment options but at least the conversations have begun."
1388,"I believe it is fair to use risk assessment tools even though they are not 100% accurate.  Research validates the use of these tools in assisting pre- and post-adjudication decisions.  I work for Probation and these tools are used everyday to inform judges, attorneys, officers and other important stakeholders as to the status of new offenders and the progress of current probationers. "
1389,"I believe mental health professional are receptive to the RNR approach with PWMI in the justice system.  For example, here in Orange County, Probation and Health Care Agency are working together to find ways to share data to get a full picture of offenders in terms of health and mental issues and criminogenic risk factors.  The focus is not on recidivism risk per se but assessing the factors that contribute to that risk--antisocial behavior, antisocial personality, antisocial cognition, antisocial associates, family/marital issues, school/work problems, leisure/recreational activities and substance abuse.  Understanding offenders in terms of these criminogenic factors, in addition to considering health and mental issues, is critical when developing relevant treatment options and the most effective way to approach individual treatment."
1390,"Efforts have been made for Probation to get up to speed in terms of supervising PWMI and referring them to needed mental health services.  Probation supervision of PWMI , however, continues to face challenges--the lack of resources to train probation officers about mental illness and how to work with PWMI,  the lack of and quality of mental health services available in the community, the fact that treatment is voluntary (often PWMI involved in the criminal justice system will opt out of treatment) and adherence to treatment.  I do believe that probation supervision is the better choice over incarceration but these challenges need to be addressed."
1391,"I would volunteer to be a participant in a mental health court.  I am currently involved with two specialty juvenile courts with OC Probation--Juvenile Recovery Court (drug court) and Youth Development Court (serious offense cases).  In both courts, all relevant stakeholders are directly involved in decisions for each participating youth--the juvenile court judge, the public defender assigned to the youth's case, the youth's attorney, the youth's probation officer, a mental health clinician/counselor, a social worker, an educational counselor, and any other community-based providers offering services in the community relevant to the participant.  All these individuals work together to make decisions about programs and treatments appropriate for the participant to help him/her successfully complete Probation and eliminate or reduce his/her risk of reoffending.  A mental health court, like these specialty courts, offer additional input and resources for the offender which would not necessarily be available in a traditional court."
1392,"In terms of Probation supervision of PWMI, I would recommend a specialized mental health court program that utilizes the Risk-Needs-Responsivity (RNR) model.  In a mental health court program, a number of providers are involved in the PWMI’s case, including, but not limited to, a probation officer, a mental health clinician/counselor, a social worker, and any other relevant community-based providers.  These individuals work together to make decisions about appropriate and relevant programs and treatments for PWMI.  This type of collaborative and specialized program is critical for Probation since probation officers are not specifically trained in mental health diagnosis and treatment. Although Skeem et al. (2015) argue that there is a lack of research on the usage of the RNR model with PWMI, I believe that components of the RNR approach can be helpful to those involved with PWMI on probation supervision.  An assessment of recidivism risk may not be directly relevant to PWMI, but assessment of the risks associated with recidivism can only add to fully understanding PWMI for the purpose of selecting appropriate treatments.  An example is substance abuse.  While substance abuse has a strong correlation with recidivism, it has also been found to interact with mental illness, increasing the risk of violence among PWMI (Skeem et al., 2015).  In addition, an individual that simultaneously experiences a mental illness and a substance use disorder is considered to have a “dual diagnosis” (National Alliance on Mental Illness, n.d.).  The responsivity approach would also be useful with PWMI since it involves customizing programs and treatments to individual need.  For example, to yield the greatest outcomes for PWMI, probation supervision, programs and treatment should take into consideration any cognitive limitations specific to PWMI.  References National Alliance on Mental Illness (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.nami.org/learn-more/mental-health-conditions/related-conditions/dual-diagnosis"
1393,"Hi Nani, I agree with you that having PWMI assigned to probation officers who have received specialized training in mental health issues and treatment would be helpful for PWMI.  Your recommendation is similar to what specialized mental health court programs include (i.e. probation officers assigned to these types of specific cases with smaller caseloads).  However, rather than develop the probation officer into a specialized mental health professional involved with treatment and medication, I would suggest sticking to the collaborative model of these specialized courts by involving mental health professionals on these specific cases in conjunction with the supervising probation officer.  I believe PWMI are best served by collaboration between professionals from the criminal justice and mental health systems rather than having the probation officer wear both hats.  "
1394,"Hi Suz, I understand why we want to take caution with applying models (like RNR) across the board without taking into account a specialized population like PWMI.  However, I respectfully disagree that we should just rely on empirically-supported models.  We have a growing number of evidence-based practices because people are willing to think out of the box and try something different.  Alongside trying something different, it is important to collect data for the purpose of validating the use of those practices.  In the case of RNR, I believe it can, in part, be effective with PWMI.  In my opinion, we should apply the RNR approach (or at least parts of it) with PWMI and, at the same time, analyze what is and is not effective and go from there.  "
1395,"It seems that the chaos of a prison environment would cause incarcerated PWMI additional stress.  If an inmate is not adequately assessed as having a mental disorder at entry, he/she may not be receiving needed treatment and medications and that could exacerbate his/her symptoms."
1396,"I believe it is possible that some prisoners with mental illness can rehabilitate.  It would depend on the severity of the illness, length the individual has been suffering from the illness and, most importantly, the individual adhering to treatment and medication.  It would also be beneficial for PWMI to receive skills training (e.g. appropriate ways to respond to others, interpreting others' behavior) and for the PWMI to receive community monitoring after release so that the PWMI continues treatment and medication."
1397,"I believe the disadvantages of solitary confinement outweigh any advantage of helping jail/prison staff maintain safety and order.  Taking away control and social contact is detrimental to anyone and more so for PWMI.  Solitary confinement mostly serves as a benefit to staff and, in the long run, the changes in prisoners due to solitary confinement would likely make them more unmanageable. "
1398,I agree with the man in the video that money would be better spent on funding community-based treatment services so PWMI receive needed treatment so they can possibly avoid becoming involved in the criminal justice system.  This would be a better solution since PWMI do not do well and may even get worse when incarcerated.
1399,"One way to keep inmates and staff safe would be to complete a mental health assessment at prison entry for the purposes of identifying prior, current or potential mental health problems, evaluating inmate need for treatment and medication and identifying inmates who may be a danger to themselves or others (Adams & Ferrandino, 2008).  Untreated inmates with mental illness frequently act out in bizarre ways, upsetting others who often will react in violent ways toward PWMI (Adams & Ferrandino, 2008).  On the other hand, mentally ill inmates who receive proper mental health treatments are better able to manage their behavior and understand and follow institutional rules which likely will reduce the risk of harmful reactions by other inmates and correctional officers.  Another suggestion for keeping inmates and staff safe while containing costs would be to be purposeful in how inmates with mental illness are housed.  Insulating inmates from certain populations and aspects of prison environments is likely to reduce the risk of violence and potential victimization of PWMI (Adams & Ferrandino, 2008).  A relatively small investment could also be made to train correctional officers on the Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) approach (Pelfrey & Young, 2019).  CIT is designed to educate officers about mental health issues, promote their understanding about the challenges that PWMI face and to teach them de-escalation techniques to reduce harm to PWMI. PWMI should receive more resources (i.e. staff, counseling, medication) than other inmates not suffering from mental illness.  Management of mental health issues among PWMI is essential for treatment compliance and progress.  Individual treatment and the trial-and-error approach is also important to successfully treat PWMI and minimize their risk of violence (Adams & Ferrandino, 2008).  Providing such treatment requires more resources for staffing and services but is a worthwhile investment for maintaining safety in the prison.  Additional resources should be used to assure that PWMI are able to access ongoing mental health services in the community.  PWMI released from custody without proper treatment are likely to return to the criminal justice system, costing California taxpayers about $75,000 per prisoner (P254 Lecture 7-1).

1400,"Hi Shayda, I also see the point of keeping supermax for safety and security reasons for some inmates but not for PWMI.  In my opinion, limiting time in supermax and allowing for out-of-cell time would not reduce the detrimental effects to PWMI.  As we saw in the Solitary Confinement video in Lesson 7-3, the inmate was still very stressed during out-of-cell time.  He seemed much more calm when he was able to have one-on-one social contact.  One option could be to have adjoining cells separated by a gate for PWMI so they do not feel completely isolated.  Prisons could also take a more proactive approach by making thoughtful decisions about the housing of PWMI.  According to Adams and Ferrandino (2008), insulating inmates from certain populations and aspects of prison environments is likely to reduce the risk of violence.  This may prevent PWMI from having to be sent to supermax in the first place.  References Adams, K., & Ferrandino, J. (2008), Managing mentally ill inmates in prisons. Criminal Justice and Behavior, 35(8), 913-927."
1401,"Hi Denise, Thank you for your very thoughtful and comprehensive post.  I think you checked off every box in terms of suggestions for treatment of PWMI in prisons (e.g. assessment [including co-occurring disorder], separate housing and programs, correctional officer involvement) and justifying costs associated with that treatment.  I particularly appreciate that you raised the issue of minimizing liability costs associated with injury and inadequate care lawsuits...very insightful!  Really great post!"
1402,"I believe the new Fulton State Hospital is a good investment.  Treatment of the mentally ill has changed from ""lock up"" to rehabilitation and I believe a new constructed hospital with facilities designed to support a rehabilitative environment would be beneficial for the State.  "
1403," I would describe the Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity (NGRI) a ""Get out of Jail Free"" card because under the NGRI defense the offender avoids going to jail.  The offender may not be released into the community (and possibly never) but he/she would go to a mental health facility instead of jail."
1404,"State hospitals need to train staff to understand and appropriately deal with mental health patients.  The other necessary component of this would be to assure that newly trained staff have a required minimum number of hours shadowing more experienced staff and have direct experience with patients.  I think money should be spent on increasing the number of staff at state hospitals so that they can work in teams of at least two, especially in units with the more severely mentally ill."
1405,I support the use of deep brain stimulation for the treatment of depression.  It is also encouraging to see that brain stimulation also has the potential for for treating other neurological diseases such as Parkinson's.  The implementation of new treatments is essential for understanding diseases and disorders and for finding cures.
1406,"Individuals with untreated mental illness often become involved in the criminal justice system because of their illness.  Therefore, the primary concern in the management of these criminal offenders should be to address their mental health needs, which is an essential component of rehabilitation (Felthous, 2013). I believe that state hospitals offer an appropriate alternative to jails and prisons for these mentally ill offenders in need of treatment services.  State hospitals are better suited to handle mentally ill individuals who may be a danger to themselves or others, exhibit inappropriate or problematic behavior or are not fit to be released into the community because of their mental illness (Fisher, Geller & Pandiani, 2009).  State hospitals are also able to house larger numbers of PWMI and can maintain separate units of PWMI based on severity of illness and/or security risk (Fisher et al., 2009).  Therefore, state hospitals would not need to be used exclusively for forensic patients but could have one or more dedicated units for forensic patients.  The Conditional Release Programs (CONREP) at California Department of State Hospitals treat patients with a variety of commitment types—Not Guilty of Reason of Insanity (NGRI), Incompetent to Stand Trial (IST), mentally disordered offenders and parolees on outpatient status (The California Department of State Hospitals, 2018). State hospitals need to take a greater role in the treatment of mentally ill criminal offenders, employing a more updated rehabilitative approach.  An example of this was presented in the video of the groundbreaking of the new Fulton State Hospital campus in Missouri which indicated that the new facility was designed to be safer and more conducive to modern treatment (P254 Lesson 8-1).

1407,"Hi Briana, I appreciate your suggestion that state hospitals should serve a wider population of PWMI to prevent PWMI from committing crimes in the first place.   In California, this could be accomplished through the system of community-based services managed by the State's Department of State Hospitals.  Community-based service providers should also be responsible for assuring that PWMI adhere to treatment and medications so they don't fall into or reenter the criminal justice system."
1408,"Hi Liisa, I appreciate your suggestion of diverting offenders to alternative courts for mental illness, homelessness and substance abuse.  It highlights the importance of addressing the multiple factors that can contribute to criminal behavior.  I think we need to learn more about how these factors interact to get a better understanding of specific needs.  Your suggestion for a pilot program is a great idea!"
1409,"Data sharing between CJ and MH systems promotes a better understanding of the relationship between criminal justice and mental health factors which can be helpful for programming decisions and service provision.  I believe that there still are obstacles that prevent data sharing--HIPAA  (including the understanding of the regulations), technology issues.  CJ and MH stakeholders need to work together to understand what data can be shared and the use of those data."
1410,The CIT trained officer is calm and asking questions to get more information.  He is able to build rapport in a short time by remaining calm and is able to gain the individual's trust and cooperation.  A routine law enforcement encounter would likely involve a more aggressive approach on the part of the officer which may escalate the situation and increase the risk of someone getting hurt in the process.
1411,"I believe that individuals working in the correctional system often are unaware that they deal with mentally ill offenders everyday.  Therefore, they would not understand why PWMI would have to be treated differently and would not see why they need specialized training.  It's unfortunate that the the resistance is so great that court orders have to be in place for officers to get the needed training.  The one officer in the video that received the training recognized that PWMI were people he dealt with everyday.  "
1412,"Correctional facilities have a history of being punative environments.  This perspective goes against the mental health treatment model which is one of rehabilitation.  Therefore, it is important for correctional staff to receive training about mental illness and how PWMI should be treated so they work in concert with mental health workers. "
1413,"Criminal justice personnel who interact with PWMI would benefit from learning about mental illness and treatments and, most importantly, how to effectively deal with PWMI.  In a study of the impact of mental health training for correctional officers, the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) in Indiana developed a program which included the following mental health-related topics: 1) major categories of psychiatric disorders, 2) biology of mental illness, 3) treatment of mental illness, and 4) how to interact effectively with people with mental illness (Parker, 2009, p. 641).  This training proved to be effective in decreasing the use of force by correctional officers and the number of assaults on officers that involved bodily waste. The Crisis Intervention Team (CTI) model is another training program that educates police officers about mental health issues and how best to deal with PWMI.  Officers that receive CTI training learn the following: 1) the signs and symptoms of mental illness, 2) mental health treatment, 3) co-occurring disorders, 4) legal issues, and 5) de-escalation techniques (Watson & Fulambarker, 2013, p. 2).  Initial research on the CTI program has demonstrated its use to be associated with a reduction in arrests, an increase in safety and more referrals of PWMI to mental health services (Dupont & Cochran, in Watson & Fulambarker, 2013).  In another study by Taheri (2016), officers trained in CIT, as compared to non-CIT officers, were more likely to refer PWMI to community-based resources than arrest them. Just as criminal justice personnel need to learn about mental illness, mental health professionals must learn about aspects of the criminal justice system so they understand what other challenges PWMI face at the time of arrest, during the adjudication process, while incarcerated and under community supervision.  As indicated in the class lecture (P254 Lecture 9-4), mental health professionals would benefit from training about the system, staff and procedures associated with law enforcement, the courts, correctional agencies and community supervision.  Mental health workers that are aware of the obstacles that PWMI face because of their involvement in the criminal justice system will be able to develop and implement programs, services and treatments relevant to this population.  References Parker, G. (2009) Impact of a mental health training course for correction"
1414,"Hi Serenity, I appreciate that you ended your post with a discussion about PWMI rights.  I overlooked that aspect but I can see how important that information would be for criminal justice and mental health personnel.  It is especially relevant from a liability perspective since criminal justice and mental health care agencies cannot afford to be involved in litigation for disregarding the rights of a PWMI. "
1415,"Hi Nani, I appreciate that you highlight the need for communication between criminal justice and mental health personnel.  Based on my experience being involved in the juvenile recovery court, I do see that criminal justice staff and mental health workers often do not trust each other.  Recently I sat in on a staffing session and witnessed a probation officer and a mental health care clinician at odds with each other on a youth's case.  The mental health worker indicated that the youth was regularly attending counseling sessions and said the youth was interested in attending a particular program.  The probation officer indicated that the youth had a positive drug test during the same period of time and that the youth told her that he didn't want to attend the program.  It appeared that they didn't trust what the other person was saying.  They trusted the youth rather than taking the time to communicate directly with each other.  This is not an unusual situation during a staffing session but it does demonstrate how a lack of communication between providers can create unneeded disagreements.  What works with the collaborative court is that, in this and similar situations, the judge listens to both perspectives and makes a decision."
1416,I do not believe the benefits of a national registry of mentally ill persons out weigh the costs. Less than 5% of individuals with mentally ill account for the report violent offenses. They do not have a statistically high likelihood of committing a violent offense. I believe this would further prevent individuals from coming forward and seeking treatment because they would be worried they would not have the right to own those guns. There are too many factors in which can be taken advantage of which would hurt the mentally ill but not actually increase the safety of others through the national registry. 
1417,"This is a difficult question for me as I see many difficult problems but not that many solutions. I think the first step which is needed, therefore the one that should be the most important in this case then, is helping them find homes. Helping PWMI's find homes promotes structure and relieves a serious stress on their lives of not knowingn where they might sleep that night. Once the structure is in place and that stresser is relieved I believe the government and PWMI's themselves can take futher action to help their overall lives such as gianing employment and social interactions. Many job applications require an address for the applicant as well as many social interactions need a safe place to commence. "
1418,"The treatment and care for persons with mental illness has beenn driven and controlled by many non-medical factors. These factors include religion, social ideals, and even gender. The main theme seen throughout all of these factors is a social norm. When an indidivual performed or acted in such way that was outside of what was considered to be the social norm at the time they would branded with the title of menal illness. Society tried to find ways of treating this lack in social norm in different methods such as torture, execution, etc. Prior to the civil war and with the inflience of Dorothea Dix they begann to use treatment rather than punishment. "
1419,"Over all I think the main theme seen throughout all the different ways in which mental illness has been viewed throughout the centuries is the idea of social norms. Anytime an individual does not fit the ""social norm"" they are labelled as mental ill and then secured from the normal group. This aligns with the ted talk lecture which referred to this as the them vs us model. If the individual is not going to help the well-bring the group and has the possibility of negatively effecting the group then they are outcast and not considered full-fledged members of society. For instance in recivilization time   if individuals did not help the clan they were banished which ultimately was a death sentence for them. Another example is the middle-ages where individuals with mental illness were tortured and even murdered. This categroiziation from a lack of following the social norm is especially seen in the horrible time period of women being claimed mentally ill for questioning their social roles. The ways in which the public responds to the mentally ill have changed with time but ultimately they are still treated with the same core belief; that the mentally ill do not fit in and therefore should be segregated and classified into their own group. I am hoping, as mental illness becomes more acceptable to talk about and receive treatment for, people with mental illnesses will be more widely accepted. I think as the acceptance grows they will hopefully be considered as full-fledged members of society.  "
1420,"Danielle, I think you and I had very similar views on this discussion. We both mentioned the idea of lack of acceptance but you took that even further and mentioned the lack of education about PWMIs. I think that a very interesting and smart point and was wondering what your suggestion would be to further educate people about PWMIs. Would you integrate it in to the public schools systems? That might not reach the public school system thought. So would you go more of the media route to reach more of the public? Just curious to hear if you had any ideas on how to educate everyone on PWMIs! Great post."
1421,"Hi Briana,  I really enjoyed your layout of your reflection. The way in which you went step by step thourhgout history really showed a linear trend onn how PWMIs have been viewed. You also brought up the same idea from the Ted Talk that I did as well, ""the us and them"" idea. I think this distinction is a very main idea that can be drawn from evennt to event throughout your list of events. I guess my question of thought is how would you change this idea? Do you have any ideas on how to unify the people into accpeting PWMI as apart of the ""us"" instead of their own category. Great post!"
1422,A president can be effective in bringing about an end to the stigma of mental illness because they have a large platform. They are able to bring the discussion to the world by simply getting people to talk about it. If the leader of the country is speaking about mental health in a positive open-conversation manner that can help start a new trend of similar connversations throughout the country. I think beyond discussing mental health presidential candidates can lead the way in ending the stigma by promoting legislation that would make access to mental health care available to all individuals regardless of their background. 
1423,I believe the movement toward reducing benefits for mental health care shows that policymaker’s do not view mental health as a priority or as pressing as a matter as other health care. Their actions show their lack of considering mental health worthy of medical attention. The lack of emergency emntal health treatment for children comapred to cancer treatment is a sadening difference. The brain/mental health is a vital aspect in an invidiauls overall well-being and should be prioritized as such in the medical world. The fact that mental health patients are having a difficult time findinf treatment in the hosipitals is a serious issue that should be dealt with soon. The stigma needs to end in the policymaker level to be able to trickle down into the hospitals and allow these indidivuals to get the treatment they deserve. 
1424,"I would suggest an alternative method of treatment for the mental health of both active military members and veterans. I would suggest these individuals seek out mental health through a psychologist or support groups with other individuals experiencing similar symptoms and talking it out. I would personally suggest something along the lines of psychodynamic, existential-humanistic, behavioral, or cognitive focused therapy. Each of these techniques could help the psychologist as well as the patient uncover the root of the PTSD and help determine the best potential treatment plan. I would supplement this with support groups for the patient for him/her to realize they are not alone going through this process. "
1425,"This is a difficult question for me. I would say I only think society should be allowed to ""step in"" if the PWMI is a threat to themself or to others. This would help protect both themselves and soceity aroundn them; however, I would also limit this ""stepping in""  to a case by case circumstance. I would look at the circumstances of the indidivuals mental illness to determine if this is only a temporary threat or a more permanent one. I would lean more toward the side of caution when it comes to restricting PMWIs rights as I believe this is a slippery slope and once you start ""stepping in"" too much this could be a danger to over restricting individualds withs PMWI thus continuing the danegrous cycle of PWMIs not wanting to seek help or be labeled at PMWI. "
1426,Hi everyone I am Elise Nelson. I enrolled in this program after deciding that medical school was not the right choice for myself. I am working now toward becoming a clinical psychologist and hope to attend more school after this program. I hope to gain more knowledge on how people with mental illness interact with the law and what can be done to help reduce stigma. 
1427,"The various forms of stigma related to PMWIs ultimately stem from a lack of knowledge and understanding abut PMWIs by the public. As the textbook states stigmas already have a negative connotation just from where the root originates. They are used to create a “them vs us” labeling system which creates a binary issue. Once these individuals are stigmatized they being to experiences many loses throughout their life. These losses include, but are not limited to, status, civil rights, long-term care, social, ability to find housing, etc. These stigmas are deep rooted in societies beliefs right now and history has shown that changing the publics belief will take time and effort. I believe the best way to reduce and ultimately eliminate these stigmas is to start with the youth of our society.   I would suggest elementary, middle, and high schools begin talking about mental illness more regularly. Students start learning about aspects of health throughout their educational years and specifically health classes. However, these classes seem to focus on the physical health of individuals rather than mental health. These health classes should expand their subject matter and work with the students to integrate mental health as a heath factor with comparative importance to physical health. I believe this integration will help students see mental health as normal and help them realize that they can seek help if they need. Just as when you are sick with a cold you see a doctor, I want the students to feel comfortable seeking help for their mental health. I would suggest that elementary age children begin to learn that each individuals body, mind, and personalities are different on a more basic and general knowledge. I would then suggest that middle school and high school become more detailed as to why the brain components or body components of individuals differ and the possible effects of such. Targeting the youth will help facilitate the normalcy of mental illness and then eventually bring it up through society. The youth of today will be the voters of tomorrow and the parents of tomorrow.  They will pass down their beliefs to next generation and so on. Slowly but surely I believe this implementation of mental illness conversation and learning into the education system could help reduce and possible eliminate the stigma.  "

1429,"Steve, You and I had similar suggestions about the integration of mental health into the education system. I specifically liked your mention of chemical imbalances and neurotransmitters to understanding brain'sains functions. I think this would show that just as cancer is a health condition which should be tended to so should mental illnesses. Your suggestions seemed very science-oriented so I guess my question would be how would you implement these topics into specific classes. Would you suggest adding these into more science-based classes or health classes or even creating a new class? Furthermore, do you think that both public and private schools would implement this or do you think private schools would stray away from the implementation? Just curious! Great post!"
1430,"Denise, You brought up some great possible solutions to reducing the stigma through integration in the education system. The one thing that keeps coming to my mind as I read everyone's post is how the educational system is currently set up. Each state is in control of their own educational curriculum. I wonder if this legal structure would limit the ability of mental illness conversation/education to be integrated. I personally wonder if some states would choose not to integrate it at all while others begin to prioritize it and add specialized classes for it. I guess my question to you is would you have a suggestion on how you would implement your suggestions that would work for each state/the country as a whole? Just curious to hear your thoughts! Great post!"
1431,"The degree of sensitivity refers to the portion of people who have a disease who also have a positive test result. Whereas, specificity refers to the proportion of patients who do not have the disease who have a nnegative test. Each test design has to give a little on one of these aspects or the other in order to be able to create the test. However, this effects the outcome of true positives, false positives, false negatives, and true negatives. This is a dangerous give and take when thinking about civil commitment. Ultimatelty the goal would be to have 100% true positives and 100% true nengatives. However, we all no this is not the case. What we definitely do not want is a bunch of false positives where people may be commited when they do not have a positive for the disease or the opposite where the test makers miss an individual with the disease because of a false positive and do not commit them. Both of these could harm both the rights of the individuals and the safety of others. "
1432,"Involuntary commitment of sex offenders who have completed their sentences should not be used unless an immediate threat is relevant. I say this solely ro protect those that the immediate threat would effect, whether the inddiivual themself or others. I say this with such a grain of salt though because I am a strong believer of the 14th ammendment. The 14th ammendments due process clause guarantees the protection of an individuals rights. If this protection were not afforded or inforced than individuals and the government can strip anyones rightrs away as they please. The sex offenders committed their crime and did their punishment. Anything further in mind is cruel and unusual punishment. "
1433,"I believe inpatient care is a larger reach of state authority into an indidivuals liberty. Outpatient is temporary as well as cosniders more immediate dangers. Whereas inpatient can be for long periods of time. Outpatient treatment also shows an increase in medication compliance, decrease in homelessness, and studies that show outpatients enjoy a better quality of life after intervention. Futhermore, inpatient care can deprive an inndidivual of his/her rights for a undisclosed amount of time and against their due process rights as seen in the prior video lectures. "
1434,"With this all being said, I thinnk both impatient care and out patient care infringe on individuals rights. I think the biggest deciding factor for me to choose inpatient care over outpatient is the duration. I do not believe ann individual should be held against their will without their hapeas corpus rights or due process rights. I would suggest these rights be intently watched."
1435,"There are many pros and cons to inpatient and outpatient care. Some of the pros of involuntary inpatient care are facilitates treatment to patients that might be otherwise unwilling to accept treatment they may need. Another pro is constant supervision and immediate attention to all of the patients potential needs. This could help prevent the patient from harming themselves or others around them. Some pros to outpatient care are that it allows the patients to continue their everyday lives - attending work/school etc while still seeking treatment. Often times patients who are outpatients are more compliant to medication as well as more likely to continue their mental health treatment engagement. While there are many pros for both inpatient and outpatient involuntary commitment there also many cons. Some of these cons are the infringement on an individuals rights and due process. The fourteenth amendment guarantees all individuals their due process rights in order for any legal action to occur. This ultimately helps protect their rights from any infringement. Involuntarily committing these individuals should be heavily scrutinized and specifically tailored case by case in order to protect the patients and the precedent. As the AMA Journal of Ethics points out that even though courts set strict legal limits to coerced treatment many states still allow for extended treatments without a set criteria to follow (Virtual Mentor, 2003). Another possible con of inpatient involuntary care is placing a already mentally ill patient in an unfamiliar environment with limited access to loved ones may exaggerate their symptoms. I believe the appropriate measures for these forms of treatment to be effective and worth the consequences; they need to be heavily scrutinized in their criteria. If the laws are well tailored this will help prevent excessive infringement on individuals rights while still providing the benefits of the treatments. I would suggest that a clinical psychologist or a forensic psychologist assess the patient before, during, and after their stay in both the outpatient and inpatient treatments. This will help to gather important data and information on whether the treatment was actually effective for that particular patient in this particular point in their life.    Virtual Mentor. 2003;5(10):324-327. doi: 10.1001/virtualmentor.2003.5.10.jdsc1-0310.</spa"

1437,"Viviana, I really enjoyed your post. I too mentioned that the most prominent liberty infringment on an individuals liverties is the duration of time the involuntary commitment can take. I was wondering what your thought are on how this effects an individuals due process rights guaranteed under the 14th ammendment. You did a great job at bringing in the text definition of standard of proof to further inforce you point. I think this is an important aspect of the due process rights but I worry there is too much infringement. Would you suggest that education is the best means at combating that?"
1438,"Briana, Your point about educating to decrease stigma is extremely important. I wish I had thought about it! That would help decrease individuals from not seeking care because they are worried about the stigma. I think combing education and more oversight but clinical professionals the benefits might outweigh the cons a little bit more! This could help protect the patients as well as the public (which is ultimately goal of outpatient and inpatient care anyway) by making it more efficient and sufficient. Great post!"
1439,"The trial process or Adjudication provess would be the most difficult for PWMIs in my opinion. This is the stage where the indidivual must choose to plea guilty for a lesser charge, or other incentives. The PWMI must be able to understand the process and which each of the pleas mean as well as the deals. PWMIs might want to look at possible deals for their particular mental illness. Their mental illness might also prevent them from understanding the deals and the consequences of taking or decling the deals. The PWMIs must then rely and trust their representation and attorneys to look out or their best interest when they might not have the best views of the lawyer or judical system. "
1440,"There are both benefits and challenges that arise for PWMIs with the recent changes in California corrections. Some of the benefits of these changes are reducinng prision populations, reclassifying drug and property delonies to misdemeanors, assisting in clearingn up individuals' prior records, as well as dealing with the poor health conditions of priosners. However, some of the challenges that arise from this are the access to mental health becomes more difficult. As prison populations decrese the jail popualtions increase which hurts the countys funnding since they have to accomodate for more inmates. This hit on funding directly impacts the mental health treatment availablities for PMWIs."
1441,"This is a difficult question for me to navigate as I see both sides. I would prefer that mental health access and referal be easier to acess with a faster response time. However, I know that this is not the case and often PWMI are not able to receive these serives right away when they need them. Police offers need more training on how to deal with PWMI in order for their role as first responders to be more efficent and useful. Police officers acting as first responders will help PWMI receive mental health resources but it also might cause more harm to the PWMI in the long term. "
1442,I would only say it is fair if the officers receive the training on how to interact with PWMIs and are truly trying to help the PWMI out. I also think the primary reason police officers are considered to be the first responders if because when people call 9-1-1 they are often met with police offers to handle their dilemma. 
1443,"CIT and stigma are extremely related. As the video states, most officers come into the training thinking they are giving up a tactical advantage when trying to go for the empathy route. This shows that many polive offers still believe that PWMIs are dangerous and should be met with tactical responses instead of empathetic ones. I think this CIT does a good job at trying to combat this stigma by showing that using empathy can often times deescalate the situation instead of the use of firearms or tazers. The way the officers are taught to use eye contact, keep a safe distance, and repeat in their own way what the PWMI is saying shows that they are carinng for the PWMI and will help deescalate the situation. The more this training is taught and used the less I think the stigmas of PWMI will be continued down the line of training to new officers. "
1444," Taheri points out that PWMIs are three times more likely to end up incarcerated. This is a serious issue which clearly needs to be attended to. As of right now I believe CIT to be the most helpful training to be implemented in order to compat these disproportional numbers. CITs ultimate goal is to reduce the amount of arrest for PWMIs and reduce injury counts for officers and civilians. The Taheri article clearly states throughout the article that there is not enough research on the matter. However, the author also states that CIT is helpful in reducing stigma for mental illnesses. CIT is also positive in reducing PWMIs being arrested because they are referred to programs instead. Officers that were trained in CIT became more prone to referring the PWMIs to programs. This CIT training should be implemented into more cities in order to see if it would decrease the overall arrest rate as that was unchanged. I would suggest more research be done on specifically looking at if the arrest rates would be directly affected with more referrals of PWMIs or the overall data of those being arrested. I believe it is important for CIT training to continue and be more widely integrated into the system. I think it needs to be running for a few years and multiple locations in order for decent research to be before. Taheri’s finding show a decrease in the number of arrest for PWMIs for officer who had CIT training. The only issue with the Taheri findings are that there is mixed data on injury account. This mixed data shows a need for more research. One positive that the CIT trainings has integrated into the officers is the decrease of stigma on mental illness. As the lecture video showed, the officers were much more educated and understanding on how to handle the matter and deescalate the situation. Overall Taheri points out that CIT training has many positives that should be continually implemented and there is not enough evidence for the negatives to pull the training."
1445,Steve- You brought up a great point about the lact of prove effectiveness. I think this has to do with the lack of research. As we all know research takes a lot of time to go through the peer-review process and actually get published. I wonder if there is any current research going on right now that we are unnaware of. Great post!
1446,Caroline- I specifcally emjoyed your reccomendation of  a team of ex-military conflict resolutions’ to teach the training. I think this could help make the training uniform while also supplying the training in a more efficent manner.  I guess the only concern that would come to my mind would be funnding for such a team. I wonder how that would go and where it would come from. Also do you think there would have to be guidlines to follow for the training or just trust that the team would follow the same points each training session. Great post!  
1447,I imagine that an individual with mental illness who has been arrested more than 100 times is going through a very difficult and confusing time. On one hand they may be finally getting fresh clothes to change into and a guaranteed bed to sleep in for the night while on the other hand they are being told that they are breaking the law in ways they might not fully understand or have no other option. As the video states some of the inmates are in there because they are caught stealing food or clothes for themselves or trespassing when trying to find a place to sleep. People with mental illness are often shipped out of jail with just a bag of pills with no where to go but back to the jails once they commit another crime. They must feel isolated from society and looked down upon and confused.  
1448,"Indicators help to provide a standard to be able to compare and contrast. They help tell you how well you are doing as well as where there may be room for improvement. I think three important indicators jails should measure about mental illness are health status, cost of standard stay, and safety. Ultimately safety should be the jails number one priority and that includes the safety of individuals with mental illness for themselves as well as those around them. Secondly the health status of the individual should measured. This measure would provide a standard in which can be compared to see either progress or regression in symptoms or illnesses. The cost of standard stay should also be measured as it might make it easier for budgeting or looking for other resources to be able to provide the necessary treatment or show that Ann alternative cheaper option might be required.  "
1449,"I think jail inmates have an adequate amount of rights. There has to be a balance of safety and due process rights. The inmates regardless of their level of crime, essentially broke the law and the social contract that society follows. Thus they should lose some of these rights to maintain order and safety but they must follow the due process clause guaranteed under the 14th amendment. They are still guaranteed rights such as free speech as long as they pass the Turner test and guaranteed freedom of religion and can practice as long as they are not harmful. These rights are still maintained where others such as privacy or right to bare arms are not possible for safety reasons and order. Ultimately the rights the prisoners lose when they break the law are those that help protect safety and order and this should be suspended from the prisoners while incarcerated.   "
1450,This is a difficult question for me as I am unsure why medication is usually the solution when it is typically a band-aid or short term fix. My assumption is that there is a lacking amount of community services to help. With the overpopulation in the jails there must be too many inmated for any sort of long-term affective mental health treatment. It would be too difficult for one or two mental health providers to be able to accomodate all the PWMIs within the system. There would probably need to be a increase in community service help and this would be much more liekly if the stigma of mental illness were to decrease. This would help create more funding for the services needed within the jails for the PWMIs
1451,"The use of jails for the seriously mentally ill is a necessary evil at this moment in time. I think it is overall inappropriate for the well-being of all individuals with serious mental illness and the stigma around it. With that being said, there needs to be alternatives in order for it to not be the case. At the current moment there is no alternative for the use of jails for the seriously mentally ill which is putting too much finacial, architectural, and operational constraints on the system. The Realignment in California has unfortunately caused an increase of people with mental illnesses to be sent to country jail as well as an influx of inmates from the prisons. This creates overcrowding of the country jails which thus creates the problem of underfunding and ultimately worse conditions for the inmates (Lofstrom, Bird & Martin, 2016). This overcrowding also has increased jails need for more mental health care more their inmates. In fact, San Francisco even reported that their need for mental health treatment has increased by over 77% (Torrey et. al, 2010). The underfunding makes it much more difficult for the jails to adequately provide care for inmates which they are guaranteed under the 8th amendment of the constitution. This was established through the court case of Estelle v. Gamble. This has been difficult to maintain without the necessary funding. Some jails have even had to shut own certain wings of their facilities because of a lack of funding. Clearly this is not effective in the architectual or operational aspects. There should be more referals of PWMI to mental health facilities before they are arrested and instead of being arrested. If arresting the individual is the unfortunate but only option there are other policies within the jail that can be implemented to help including; screening at intake for mental health and discharge planning. The police officers should also be trained it CIT training to help increase referals and decrease arrests (Taheri, 2014).   Lofstrom, M., Bird, M., & Martin, B. (2016). California's Historic Corrections Reforms. Public Policy Institute of California. Taheri, S. A. (2014).

1452,Caroline- You brought up some great facts to support your opinion. I particularly was interested in your suggestion of complete prison reform specifically for the mentally ill. If you were to purpose a new reform policy what exactly would you implement in order to effectively help the mentally ill? Would you tackle one aspect at a time policy by policy or would you try to start over completely? I assume that prison/jail reform would cost both the state and federal levels a great deal of money so who would be expected to pay? I think reform is an important aspect to consider but I worry the logistics of it are too difficult. Curious to hear your thoughts! Great post.
1453,"Viviana- Thanks for the response! Just wanted to clarify what I meant when I said there are no other viable options. Of course there are other options but there are none that have enough backing of support or funding to ultimately outweight the jails being used right now, However, I do see promising legislation and actions coming to light. For instance many cities are working on implementing mental health courts which focus on treatment rather than punishment. The Brooklyn Mental Health Court for example opened up in 2002 and aimed specifically at helping nonviolent adult mentally ill felony offenders (D'Emic, 2007). I believe courts like these WILL be a viable option but there needs to be more of them across the country and much more funding to support them in order for the use of jails to decrease for the mentally ill.  I agree with you when you state that it boils down to politics and funding but that takes time and lot of effort to deal with.    D'Emic, M. J. (2007). The promise of mental health courts brooklyn criminal justice system experiments with treatment as an alternative to prison. Criminal Justice , 22(3), 24-29.  "
1454,"I do not think the use of risk assessment toolds are ""fair"" toolss when they are not 100% accurate but I think they are a necessary evil until a more accurate tool is created. Parloe officers have a lot of cases to manage and a lot of individuals to manage. They are often times over worked and risk assement tools can help decide the risk of these individuals reoffend. Risk assessment practices fall under the category of evidence based practices and I would suggest they continue to be used until a more accurate tool is developed."
1455,These tools help standnardized the way in which parole and sentences are given out which may help to decrease any disparities within the justice system.
1456,"I believe mental health professionals would not be very receptive to the RNR approach. The stigma around mentnal illness is still very strong and prevelant. As the follow-up video highlights, the news plays into crimes where individuals have mental illness and points to that as a cause for their action. And as the video shows this association is not backed up by studies or evidence. I believe that mental health professionals would be fearful that this stigma and lack of knowledge would be a large barrier for PWMIs. This barrier may cause PWMIs to recieve harsher punishments or possibly prevent them from being released on parole. "
1457,I think probation is set up to address supervision annd treatment of PWMI better than jail does. It is more cost effective for the community to focus on probation than to incarcerate every individual that commits a crime. As well as it being more effective it also is more practical as it focuses more on rehabilitation that punitive measures. As long as the individuals follow the conditions of their probation they are able to remain in society and continue to be an active member of their community. The treatment portion of the conditions helps deal with the problem and needs of the individual. I think this will help treat the problems rather than ignoring them. And the standard portion of the condition will focus on the PWMIs supervision and making sure they are staying employed and on top of their conditions.
1458,"If I were a PWMI I would be very appreciative to be in the mental health court instead of the traditional court processing. I would be able to get needed support in many differennt aspect of my lives. They would help me find housing, treatment, etc. It would be hard not to be able to choose where I could live or who with but the priority of my treatment is necessary. It ptovides treatment that I may not have been able to recieve otherwise if I were a PWMI. I would lose some liberties but not as many as I would in traditional court proceedings and it would benefit me greater in the long run."
1459,The focus on rehabilitative course would help me reintegrate into soceity and become a more effective and active society member. If I receive the treatment and housing I need I will be able to get a job and help facilitate the income of the community as well as help myself and possible my family.
1460," The main goal of the RIsk-Need-Responsivity Model is to reduce recidivism rates (Skeem et. Al, 2015). There is large disproportionate number of people with mental illnesses within the prison population. However, there is no clear evidence that direct therapy actually helps decrease recidivism rates for people with mental illnesses. RNR has no shown effect on violence therefore RNR suggests considering other important risk factors when looking at criminal offenses. Previous models have concentrated on treating symptoms of people with mental illnesses but the RNR model looks at other factors including homelessness, parental incarceration, substance abuse, etc. These factors heavily influence the rate of recidivism for people with mental illnesses and should be a priority for treatment. This has increased the use RNR but unfortunately there is not enough research out there currently to assure either way if RNR is effective or not. This lack of research makes it very difficult for me to give guidance backed by evidence but until there is further research on the matter my guidance for a Chief Probation Officer would be to provide a treatment that aims at focusing on both risk factors and treating symptoms of people with mental illness. I would suggest more research be performed one RNR and the combination of both RNR and symptom treatment. People with mental illnesses need stability in other aspects of their life in order to be an effective citizen. Stability is the common denominator throughout this discussion because PWMI need stability in housing, jobs, and Medicare to be able to receive treatment for their symptoms and overall the ability to focus on their mental health. I would also give guidance to the chief probation officer to be both strict in their work and also understanding. There needs to be a balance of demanding results and also understanding real life events and the problems which may arise for those with mental illnesses. This would help people with mental illnesses more in the long run and possible help them deter more from criminal reoffending than a punitive alternative."
1461,Stephanie- You and I were on the same page when it came to mentioning that one of the major issues is the lack of research. I think you did a great job at mentioning the substance abuse as another important factor that you would advise them to look at. If we focused more on treatment for the other important factors we may actually be able to decrease recidivism. I too would suggest they specialize in mental health and I would even take this a step further and add that all individuals who come into contacty with the PWMI throughout the process are required to take some form of mental health sensitivity couse. Great post!
1462,"Suz- You and I both thought that the major factor is the lack of evidential support that RNR is effective. I think your suggestionn of cognitive behavioral therapy as an alternative is a perfect suggestion. It has, as you mentioned, shown promise. Cognitive behavioral therapy is particularily helpful for indidivuals to mannage emotional challenges. Some of the major aspects that Cogintive Behavioral Therapy can help addres are:   Manage symptoms of mental illness Prevent a relapse of mental illness symptoms Treat a mental illness when medications aren't a good option Learn techniques for coping with stressful life situations Identify ways to manage emotions Resolve relationship conflicts and learn better ways to communicate Cope with grief or loss Overcome emotional trauma related to abuse or violence Cope with a medical illness </ul> I believe that if  indidivuals with PWMI recieve CBT it will help them decrease their rates of recividism by helping them in the long run. I had not thought about Coognntiive behavioral therapy as a suggestion until reading your post and now I wish I had! Do you think the use of CBT would go over as a smoot process and accepted by both parties (the PWMI and the govement) or so you think that it might take time to implemetn? Curious to hear your thoughts! Great post!   https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/about/pac-20384610  "
1463,"I think there art many ways in which the prison environment might aggravate the conditions of persons with mental illness. Prisons are a high stress environment which puts unneeded aggravation on their illnesses. Some of the possible negative ways in which the environment specifically aggravate them are, solitary confinement, no privacy, overcrowding, and tight spaces. Another major factor which might aggravate an individuals mental illnesses is the fact that they are separated from their support systems and family.  Persons with mental illnesses need these support systems and services to be able to both manage symptoms and function in society outside of the walls. The video showed an excelled mind set of the psychologist as the leader. She made a point of talking about how she looks outside of the walls and into the PWMIs future. These PWMIs can get treatment and be amore productive citizen then they were when they first were incarcerated. "
1464,"I think the idea of rehabilitation is falsely connected to fixing the indidvuals mental illness. The prisoners need to learn management of their symtpoms and their mental illnesses instead of worrying about solving the problem. If we identify ""truly rehabiliated prisoners"" as skill training and management of their symptoms then yes I believe they can. The only major concern I believe that might prevent this is the inability to access medication. If the PWMIs had easier access to the medication and were trained in those skills to help combat any symptoms and aviod any situations that might aggrevate their mental illnesses I think they can be trult rehavilitated. There just needs to be treatment options that teach them how to manage survive on their own and with the help out there already being offered. "
1465,"I believe the disadvantages of solitary confinement on the individuals outweighs the advantages for maintain prison order. The long term psychological and physical effects that can occur from the isolation and severe stress inducing environment are not worth the order created by “removing the threat” from others in the jail. The physical effects which can occur include migraines, headaches, hypertension, dizziness, digestion issues, etc. The psychological effects which can occur can be intense anxiety, sensory deprivation, depression, and even exacerbate already existent mental illnesses. These consequences could be detrimental to an individual who may have a family out there waiting for their return. I believe there has to be an alternative to maintaining order and removing any possible threats that are not solitary confinement.  "
1466,"This is a tricky question for me for a couple of reasons. First, I am still not financially on my own as I am still a student and thus I do not have much of a financial connection to this as many others in my cohort might. Another difficult aspect for me, is even if I was contributing, I would want to help out the PWMI but in an efficient and effective way. I would want the state to make sure they are being responsible and effectively distributing their money and resources to the right causes and treatments. Many of the changes are necessary but if the system had treated the individual before and not after the fact we could be saving money in the state.  So yes I would be happy to have my tax dollars being spent on the treating of metnally ill if it is an effective use of taxpayer money and effective treatment for the PWMI."
1467,"In order for prisons to best meet the need to keep inmates and staff safe, provide needed treatment for PWMI, while at the same time contain costs there needs to be a few things added to the prison system as well as the mental health care overall. One major aspect that will help keep people safe and help provide the needed treatment for PWMI is the use of screening assessments (Adams & Ferrandino, 2018). Screening assessments have been a variety of tools overtime and they have changed and developed a long the way. The screening tools help the staff as well as the inmates themselves identify any current or potential mental health problems. This identification helps to assess any need for treatment to potential risk to the staff and other inmates (Adams & Ferrandino, 2018). I believe this early assessment can help the staff and the PWMI take the essential steps in helping them become a more socially effective citizen. This is an important aspect to helping reduce prison population as well as providing safe treatment for PWMI. PWMI are a major population to look at directly helping within the prison population because they are often reoffenders and often serve longer sentences then those without mental illness. If the prison population focuses more on helping prevent reoffending and proving treatment the cost of housing the inmates will ultimately decrease since the individual will not need to be incarcerated as much if you reduce the reoffending rate. In order to be able to reduce the long term cost however; there should be more money allocated to PWMI upfront to help prevent future reoffending as well as proving the necessary treatments they may not have been able to receive otherwise. I think another possible solution to helping keep inmates and staff safe, provide needed treatment for PWMI, while at the same time contain costs is reallocating space within the jails and prisons. The PWMI should have their own area separate from those without PWMI were in that section the officers and staff are trained in CIT as well as other trainings on how to interact with PWMI. There could also be clinical psychologist and therapist on hand for any immediate need for treatment as well as psychiatrist. This will help provide safety for the other inmates as well as staff while providing an effective environment where the PWMI can receive the necessary treatment. This will also help relive the staff of any added stress of trying not to punish PWMI for behaviors"
1468,"Caroline-  You and I both agreed that PWMI should be allocated more funding and resources; however, you took this thought a step further than I did and said not in jails but rather mental hospitals. This got me thinking about where this kind of thing is being implemented currently in near by cities. I looked it up and came across a jail in the LA area where they had been working on replacing an old jail with a jail-like mental health treatment center. There were able to raise 1.7 billion to contact and build this treatment center because about 1/3 of their 17000 inmates were receiving treatment but unfortunately the contract was canceled. Even though the contract was cancelled I think it shows an important shift in societies thoughts on incarcerating people with mental illness. I think in the future the trend toward treatment rather than punishment will continue and I think your suggestion to have PWMI in mental health hospitals is a great suggestion. I think you are on the right tract and a similar thought process as the rest of California. Great post!   https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-08-24/jail-replacement-mental-health-facility-inmate-supervisors-criminal-justice-reform"
1469,"Briana- You and I agreed to a certain extent. You suggested keeping the PWMI and staff separate and providing treatment as I did as well; however, you suggested that the PWMI would not necessarily be receiving more resources. This is were I respectfully disagree with you. As of right not the guarantee to treatment for PWMI under the 8th amendment is only for “adequate care” which in my opinion does not do the work and treatment for the PWMI that they need. An article published by NPR states that the U.S. correctional facilities are the largest provider of mental health services but most of them struggle with the finances to provide the already minimal standard of adequate care. I believe that there needs to be more funding allocated to these PWMI in order for their treatment to actually be effective. This in turn will help reduce recidivism rates by PWMI and lower the incarceration costs in the long run.

1470,This is a difficult questionn for me as I believe I might feel very different if I were rasised in a state so different in education and beliefs compared to California. I would hope I would be supportive of the construction of the new Fulton Stare Hosipital as I would be if it were being built here but its difficult to say. Ultimately I would feel most supoprtive as a taxpayer in missouri if there was research oprovided showing that the expansion of the mental health facility would be effective in means of treatment as well as decreasinng incarceration rates of PWMI which ultimately would decrease the cost on the taxpayers for incarceration of those individuals. Without information and research to back up the construction however and if I did not have a background in psychology I do not know if I would be supportive of my taxpayer money being used to support the construction. 
1471,"No I do not believe the not guilty by reason of insanity is a get free out of jail card. The entire standard is to show that the defendant did not know what he was doing or why it was a crime. Also only about 1% of cases attempt to  claim not guilty by reason of  insanity and of those only 25% are actually successful in claiming so. There are many legal challenges to the insanity clause that make it difficult to prove. Also, the individuals that are actually found not guilty by reason of insanity are often held until they are mentally fit to walk free but often times judges do not think they are every mentally fit so often it is a life sentences-therefore not a get out of jail free card.   "
1472,This is a difficult question for me as I do not feel as though I know enough about the problem to offer a solution. WIthout the indepth knowledge I feel is necessary to provide a solution I would suggestion physical trainging for mental health professionals to help protect themselves usingn self defense training. I would also suggest more officers on scene but officers trained in CIT or other important trainings on how to deal with persons with mental illnesses. I would also suggest more overseeing with camera and protection officers and implementing a faster response to an incidents when a problem occurs. 
1473,I am a strong support in the development of medical sciences being used for indidivuals. If the use of deep brain stimulationn is showing positive signs of effectiveness on patients it should be researched more and possibly implemented as a more common treatment form. With that being said I think there should be medical trials with indepth research done to make sure that the treatment is actually effective and to check for any serious side effects. If the side effects remain minimal and the patients are aware of them before opting in on the surgery I think this could be a positive form of treatment for severe cases. 
1474,"State hospitals and the criminal justice system are very much connected in that state hospitals are actually composed of about 90% of the population are forensic patients. These forensic patients are anyone that was found unfit to participate in their own trial or those that have been found not guilty by reason of insanity. These patients can be held for as long as a judge thinks the patient is mentally fit to walk free but often times the judge never does believe they are mentally fit so it becomes a life sentence. With that being said I do not believe state hospitals should be used exclusively for forensic patients. The architectural structure of many of these state hospitals are similar to those of prisons. They are cold, isolated, and not in anyway a conducive environment for rehabilitation or treatment. I would suggest that the state hospitals reconstruct and reframe their mindset and focus on building separate areas of the state hospital for different kinds of patients. Individuals who may not be a forensic patient but need long-term care for mental illness should be able to go to the state hospital as the forensic patients do. These individuals struggle in the everyday life outside of the hospital and need the everyday structure the state hospital can provide (Sisti et al., 2015). They should not be turned away solely on the basis that the state hospitals have allocated all of their resources and time for forensic patients exclusively. If the state hospitals were reconstructed to house both forensic patients and PWMI with need for long-term care in different parts of the hospital it could be conducive for rehabilitation as well as treatment."
1475,"Vivana- Your thoughts on state hospitals providing treatment for both forensic patients and those who are at risk for coming into contact with the justice system is interesting. I agree that the state hospitals should not exclusively treat forensic patients but also PWMI with the need for long-term care however, I went further to say they should allocate different places within the state hospitals. I believe the only way to provide conducive treatment for the PWMI and the forensic patients as a whole is to allocate their own areas within the architectural aspects of the hospital and have each of the separate areas trained in ways to benefit the particular group. Do you think that both forensic patients and PWMI will be able to receive the rehabilitation and   treatment they need if they are combined into one population within the state hospital? If so would you treat them at all differently or as one group needing the same treatment respectively? Great post!"
1476,"Lisa- I too said that the role of state hospitals should not be utilized almost exclusively for forensic patients. However, you took this thought a step further a suggested a specific change in the way the government handles individuals who are found incompetent to stand trial. Your suggestion to have them treated in a separate setting is a very intriguing idea. I think this could help the IST patients receive the necessary treatment and hopefully be able to stand trial if the treatment is effective. As you said about 50% were homeless at the time of being referred I wonder if allocating more money up front to decrease homeless would help decrease the IST by decreasing overall arrest. You changed my original thinking on the matter and I would now suggest allocated more money to helping decrease homelessness upfront which will hopefully decrease the IST patient count and thus help decrease the forensic patients within the state hospital. I think this could help the doctors and treatment specialist within the state hospital offer more effective treatment to both PWMI and forensic patients. Do you think this would help solve the problem you brought up? Great post!"
1477,"Yes I think the forms of data sharing seem very satisfactory. The data needs to be shared around in order for solutions and new policies to be applied. I think there could be more interdisciplinary programs and agencies that can help provide necessary treatment and care for these persons with mental health issues. For instance, there could be better programs for educational programs to help increase   mental health literacy I the community. There could also be better programs in place for transition of persons with mental illnesses back into the community post release— I.e. case managers helping with the minute details of daily life in order to achieve prosocial behaviors.  "
1478,The CIT training approach appeared very different to me from a routine law enforcement encounter. The cops made a distinct effort to watch and observe the male while they were attempting to discover what exactly was happening and what the man had taken. The way the cop responded to the man saying he did not want to talk to him by letting his partner than continue the conversation showed the PWMI that they were listening and cared to hear what he had to say. Many times this would not have been the case and the original officer may have continued to speak against the PWMIs wishes. They also mentioned right away that the best solution might be to take the PWMI to the hospital to prioritize medical treatment offer arresting him.
1479,I think it often times take a court order or other legal actions for departments  because it needs to be made a priority by legal action for them to take the time to consider it. The reason being that there are so many things that the officers and other staff have to worry about that if the treatment of PWMI is not mandated by legal officers they do not have the capacity to prioritize it. Why should they focus on extra special treatment of PWMI if it is not in their job discription? It also mandates a uniformity to the departments that may have not been there before. I also think historically it take legal action for communities view points to change.
1480,"There are many chanellenges in the correctionalenviromennt that the mental health workers might have to deal with. They may have to deal with serious illnesses with limited access to help the PWMI, all the minute details of what materials they can bring into the facilities, and a mjor challenge they may have to do is fight the stigma. They might have to challenge peoples views on the mentally ill in the correctional enviroment. They also might have a hard time dealing with the emotional baggage of trying to help the PWMI in the correctional enviroment and go home with those emotional feelings and then make sure to leave those at home before returning."
1481,"There are many trainings for mental health and criminal justice actors to benefit PWMI but the one I believe to be the most essential is probably CIT but more over I think the most important part of all the trainings is increasing mental health literacy through education trainings. By proving more education on understanding mental illnesses, their symptoms, and their effects on PWMI the works will be better equipped for every day interaction with PWMI. Mental health literacy is a vital aspect of reducing the stigma of mental illness while also providing individuals with the knowledge needed to understand them.   This will help provide a very important foundation for the other trainings the mental health and criminal justice actors should be learning and using. Without the background in mental health literacy training the other trainings would be meaningless to the individuals being trained and thus ineffective in practice. When the trainings focus on educating mental health workers, courts, officers, and anyone else who comes into contact with the PWMI they are helping both the PWMI and the individual who comes into contact with them. The education can focus on tips and tricks to help recognize mental illnesses as well as their symptoms. If the individuals in the mental health and criminal justice actors are better educated on what exactly each mental illness is and how that effects the PWMI then they will be better equipped on how to proceed with the manner. This could help officers and other justice system members or mental health agents discover co-occuring disorders, medication, possible side effect, and overall reduce any misconceptions they may have of PWMI and how to interact with them. As we saw in one of the lecture videos this week, the two officers trained in CIT were called to a house to manage a man who seemed to be having a mental break down. Their background in mental health literacy encouraged their bosses and themselves to be trained in CIT. Without the mental health literacy and the understanding that people with mental health disorders should be managed and dealt with in the criminal and mental health worlds differently than those of the general population. In the video the two officers were asking questions about the PWMI and his medication. As they were trying to figure out what the medication was, why the man took it and how much he may have taken all I could think was whether or not those"
1482,"Karen, I really enjoyed reading your post as it was both very similar as well as different to my own. You focused on CIT training as the most best practice law enforcement training but later on pointed out the important parts to the CIT training that make it so essential. I essentially did the opposite by stating the parts of the CIT training are the most essential and without those parts CIT would not be effective. I especially narrowed in on the need for mental health literacy to be a focus. Mental health literacy (MHL) essentially includes reducing stigma, self-help strategies, help-seeking efficacy, and ca ultimately help reduce prejudice (Kutcher, Wei, & Coniglio, 2016) These aspects in my opinion are and should be the foundation for the trainings for mental health and criminal justice actors, including the CIT trains as you pointed out. MHL can be altered to address specific needs such as   for teacher purposes or   police officer purposes and so on.   I think increasing MHL also increases the conversation between the groups who deal with PMWI as both you adn the Parker article menntioned.   Do you think the best way to increase MHL is through the education system? I was thinking   that as soon as school aged kids are starting physical health classes they should also be starting mental health classes and learning about recognizing symptoms, risk factors, etc. Great Post!"

I too focused on decreasing the stigma for persons with mental illness. I think increasing mental health literacy in the education system would one of the more effective ways at handling this since the majority pdf the population goes through the school systems. Most mental illnesses emerge around the age of adolescence and until young adulthood and educating these youth on the signs and symptoms could help alleviate the stigmas and provide important preventive measures (Giedd, Keshavan, & Paus, 2009). Decreasing the stigma will also help in trainings like CIT which can lead to deescalation techniques as you mentioned. You took these ideas a step further and mentioned that the actors should also be knowledgable of PWMIs rights.

It is easier to convince the public that the individuals without a serious crime would benefit more from treatment than punishment. This is much harder to do with serious violent offenders--the public believe those indiduvals need to be punished. This whole thing is ironic because the majority of violent offenders are often times the ones suffering from mental illness. This is especially true in the juvenile population. I personally think these treatmetns should be extended to the violent offenders as well. "
1486,I think the hurdles are different for criminal justice and mental health agencies when it comes to implementing evidence-based practices. I think mental health agencies are more likely to integrate these new practices into there facilities because they do not have to change major policies in order to do so. For the criminal justice system they may not have the capacities to integrate the evidence-based practices and instead might have to integrate research-based or promising practice. I also think the mental health agencies are probably more willing to change the policies overal whereas the criminal justice system may not be willing to change their trainings and regulations for the new evidence based practices.
1487,Applying integrated treatments for persons with mental illness and other problems will help change the way the justice system for the better. It will help the justice system use the assessment screenings to find those early intervention needs. This will help the justice system then when working with them because they will understand what exactly the challenges the PWMI are facing as well as what treatment they will need. Understanding how these cooccurring disorders interact and applying efficient evidence-based treatment for both and not segments of each will help the individuals receive a better long-term outcome.  
1488,I think peer mentoring is an extremely good idea. This would promote positive communication about mental health issues. The mentor would provide a positive outlet for the individual with mental illness. They can ask them questions onn how to handle certain situations. It is important to be able to talk these things out with people who are going through similar experiences. Theres a sense of strength and comfort to talking to someone who gets it the way you do. It also gives the mentors a sense of usefullness and purpose when they are helping others with mental illness.
1489,"The implementation of the recommendations of the position paper of the American College of Physicians would affect the involvement, identification, treatment, and outcomes of the mentally ill in the CJ system in may different ways. The article points out the main goals of the integration are to have primary care doctors address the mental health issues, remove payment issues, help enforce policies that handle non-discrimination and finally streamline effective treatment. By integrating behavioral aspects into the health care system and primary care the way in which identification of PWMI in the criminal justice system are identified. I think it would increase the use of mental health assessments before incarceration, druipgnn incarceration and after incarceration. This would promote early diagnosis and help the PWMIs learn coping and treatment tools which might prevent them from coming into contact with the justice system all together. I also think it would help the way in which the PWMI are treated within the system if they do end up coming into contact with the justice system because they will likely know which mental illness the inmate has and then can seek out the correct treatment. Another change I think the implementation will have is on stigma of mental illness. I think by implementing it into the health care system and having children experience that at a young age they will grow up thinking that it is just a part of their overall health and there is nothing different or outcast worry about it. This is especially important for children because about 1 in 5 children suffers from a mental disorder. If the treatment starts at a younger age then they will likely learn the correct treatment avenues to help prevent them coming into contact with the CJ system.   "

1491,Briana- You made excellent points about how it would decrease the involvement of persons with mental illness in the justice system. I think primary care including mental health will also help reduce the stigma around mental health by introducing the youth to it as a normal aspect of health. I think will also in-turn help teach the youth and the community mental health literacy. Do you think that promoting mental health in the primary care system will also increase the likelihood of mental health being taught in the school system? I also wonder if the integration will help increase the trainings that the CJ workers will receive. Do you think the juvenile facilities will integrate the mental health learning into their core system?
1492,"  Steve- You and I both talked about how it would increase the use of screening assessment tools. I think it would help before incarceration, during and after. Klein and Hostetter found that, “Behavioral health conditions are extremely common, affecting nearly one of five Americans and leading to health care costs of $57 billion a year”. This shows the serious need for it to be integrated into the primary health care system. This would help find any mental illnesses an individual may be suffering from and help then learn how to manage the symptoms before they come into contact with the justice system. It would also help decrease the cost on the individual to seek treatment. I really enjoyed your post! https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/newsletter-article/2014/aug/focus-integrating-behavioral-health-and-primary-care"
1493,The answer could be as simple as removing the restraints but I think looking at the bigger picture it's obvious he needed help. He should have had mental health help before going to prison because he was depressed and suicidal. While in jail he should have also been getting help for his mental health problems. He was in administrative segregation and it is important that he gets routine mental health checks because of the environment he is in. 
1494,"Nicole,  I'm actually wondering if there are policies put in place at this prison because it seems that the policy is to restrain these individuals who act out. I think it is important to re-evaluate their policies and do better with their mental health department. I've had a little bit of experience with the mental health department in correctional settings and I know that it is routine that the mental health department evaluates administrative segregation every 15 minutes and its obvious that it is not the case where Timothy was being held. He wasn't getting any help with his diagnosis which is what needs to be done in this environment. "
1495,"I think it is clear that there were no scientific evidence in the past for the mentally ill. It was driven by religion where they believed they were possessed by evil spirts with is why they tried to treat them by purging or trephination. It slowly began to be recognized as a mental illness instead of whiches or possessions but they were then sent off to institutions. However these institutions did not treat individuals they were chained, tortured, and lived in horrible conditions. It was until Dorothea Dix, where treatment was emphasized in state hospitals but still placed in remote areas.  Dorothea Dix was an advocate for people with mental illness. I think this was the beginning of a true movement towards treatment for those with mental illness. Instead of locking up all the ""undesirables"" we began to look at them as mentally ill. We also began to have federal help which was unstable but shows a beginning towards a movement of mental health. Now we have began to care and treat those with mental illness. "
1496,"Nani, I agree that treatment is now more humanistic now but I do think it took a lot of experimenting. We went from drilling holes into peoples skulls so evil spirits could leave, to purging the sickness out of the mentally ill by draining their bloods or giving them laxatives, to just shipping them off to asylums and institutions  where they were naked and abused, to lobotomies. Once advocates came into the picture so did politicians which was  a big step in the right direction to the treatment of the mentally ill. "
1497,"No, I don't. I think that it will be more dangerous for the mentally ill to be on the registry. There is a lot of data that suggest that people with mentally ill are not dangerous. It is a lot more likely that those who abuse alcohol are more violent than people with mental illness. If anything people with mental illness will be less likely to seek out treatment. I do think it is important to reduce gun violence and make sure their is strict laws for those to be allowed to purchase guns and carry guns but I don't think the problem is the mentally ill. I don't think there needs to be a registry. "
1498,"Elise,  I strongly agree with you. I don't think it is likely that a mentally ill person would commit a violent crime. There is also evidence that supports this. I also think that it would serve as a deterrent to seek out treatment and in addition I think there is a lot more people in the world suffering with a mental illness that are living normal and safe lives. "
1499,"According to the Ted talk we need to include them in our community and give up the ""us and them"" mentality. I agree, I  think to fix this problem we need to provide them with the resources to get better and do better. I think a huge solution could begin with having institutions where they can get the mental help they need, the medications they need, they could get the proper housing they need to shower, eat, sleep so that they are better prepared to get jobs. They can meet people and do activities that are essential to a gain proper social skills need to live a normal life. We need to help reincorporate them into society. I think this would not only help the PWMI but it would get them out of our CJ system and the prisons and jail populations would decline. What we need is to reallocate our resources into the mental health area. "
1500,"Elise, I think providing housing is a good first step. You brought up a point that I had not thought of which is relieving stress. I've been so privileged to always know where I'm going to sleep at night that I never even thought of this. It also made me think about how vulnerable this population is. As it was said in the Ted talk this population is more likely to be a victim of a violent crime while people are more likely to see them as the perpetrators of violent crimes. "
1501,"During the Pre-Civilization Era people believed that the behavior of the mentally ill was due to evil spirits and the clan or family were responsible for their care. They used trephination to ""treat"" the mentally ill.  During the Ancient Civilizations it was believed that the mentally ill had imbalances in their bodily fluids such as phlegm and bile so they treated it with laxatives and cleanses.  During the Middle Ages they believed that the mentally ill were possessed by demons and they used magic charms and exorcism to treat them.  During the Renaissance humanism emerged and they housed ""lunatics"" in hospital but they were not treated they were toruted. During the Age of Enlightenment they used impriosonment as a way of social control but Phillipe pines also practiced moral therapy.  During the Pre-Civil War the mentally ill were still being purged and tortured.  During the 19th and early 20th century they believed that being mentally ill was due to biological factors and sterilization programs began to come into practice While advances were made in understanding the brain lobotomies began to be performed on the mentally ill.  Then in the 1950s Thorazine had began to be used on psychotic patient because of its calming effect.  Then there was the beginning of deinstitutionalization where the mentally ill were taken out of state hospitals and thrown into the community.  The biggest problem was that they were not being treated when they were released. This is still the issue today.  I don't think our society considered PWMI members of our society.  The Ted talk we heard talks about an ""us and them"" mentality we have.   We know that there is a vast amount of PWMI in the criminal justice system and we are aware that they need help but we do not give them the resources to do so. This is evidence of that ""us and them"" mentality. The media constructs the mentally ill as violent but that's not true, the majority of PWMI are not violent.   "
1502,"Viviana, You make great points. I also wrote about Not In My Back Yard. We know there is an issue but we don't give them the resources to help. We have an ""us and them"" mentality and it needs to change. We definitely do not perceive PWMI as part of our society and it is clear with the way we portray them in the media. "
1503,"Lisa, You point out various ways in which PWMI are shunned from society. They are de-valued, dismissed, not supported, seen as a burden, and pushed away. If the media continues to portray PWMI as outsiders and violent offenders society will continue to have this perspective on PWMI. As PWMI are casted out they end up in the streets or in the criminal justice system. If they received the support they needed they would probably end up living normal lives as long as they had the resources to manage their mental health, whether it be by going to a therapist or medication. "
1504,"I think talking about it in ways that are against stereotypes. In addition, they can implement programs to educate the public as well as make help available to those with mental illness so that they can receive the help they need to live a normal life. "
1505,"Nicolle, you bring up a good point I think if people saw the president interacting with people who have mental illnesses the public wouldn't outcast PMI as much. I think this could be as simple as opening up more mental health clinics/hospital and maybe making appearances there. "
1506,I think the policymakers who are moving toward reducing benefits for mental health care says that PWMI are worth helping. I think they're seen as defective people unlike people who need health care who are seen as sick and needing medication to get better. People don't believe that PWMI are capable of getting better and they are seen as a burden to society. In addition a lot of the time people with severe mental illness do not have the economic resources to pay for the mental services and medication they need. So they're stigmatized as poor and violent and unworthy or not important enough for help
1507,I think instead of being on medication they need to see therapist/psychologist or even as the troop said is to go to groups of veterans. I think while on active military duty they should be talking to therapist not on medication. Medication should not be an option while on active duty in my opinion and should be a last resort for veterans. I think it is important for veterans to have their groups with other veterans to know what they went through and what they're going through is normal for people who have been to war and experienced those things. 
1508,"Yes, I think that it is important for society to step in. For example when people are a danger to themselves or others they are taken in as a 5150, they're taken to hospitals where they are met with behavioral health specialist to see if they are a true danger and then they are placed on a hold for protection. I think the most important thing society can do is provide PWMI with access to mental health care and treatment I think even just having someone to talk to can help PWMI, I don't necessarily think we need to medicate everyone, although sometimes medication is what someone might need I think it's important for PWMI to have these options available."
1509,"There are various forms of stigma, as we have learned. Including structural stigmas, public stigmas, and self-stigmas. I think it is important for us to educate students including elementary, middle school, and high school student, in these stigmas and educate them on the reality of mental illness. I think it is important to start this at a young age so that if any of these children or teen agers are dealing with a mental illness they can get the proper help before it is exacerbated or at its worst level.  In addition, I think it's important that we educate them about the ""us versus them"" mentality. They need to be aware that the way the media portrays the mentally ill is not accurate. PWMI are not likely to be violent and the media always looks to blame violent actions on mental illnesses and this is making the stigma worse.  Until this week, I hadn't compared mental illnesses to medical illness. In one of the lectures the topic of cancer was brought up and how people place a bigger importance on receiving medical treatment compared to mental health treatment. We don't stigmatize people with cancer but we stigmatize people with bipolar or schizophrenia or depression. There is treatment for cancer just as there is treatment for mental illnesses. I understand that cancer kills people and is a horrible disease but this week we also learned that PWMI are likely to die at younger ages for various reasons, 30%-40% of the time its due to suicide but the remaining 60% is due to medical conditions that are caused or exacerbated by metal illness, such as obesity, smoking, and infectious diseases. "
1510,"I agree Elise, I think it is important to start educating society at a young age. I think elementary school would be a good age to educating students. I think this would help in normalizing mental illness. I think if we start them young we can eventually get rid of the ""us versus them"" mentality that todays society has. We can begin to educate them so that when they see the way media portrays PWMI as violent criminals they know that this isn't an accurate representation. And hopefully, this could help promote treatment for PWMI in the future because in the present they don't have various treatment options, especially if they are living in poverty, "
1511,"Steve,  Thats a good idea. I was wondering how we could implement educating elementary school children and I think implicating it in science courses could be a good idea. I think that they could learn an intro to psychology at a young age. Science could be a good area to begin to implement educating students in mental illness because there is a lot of chemical imbalances that have to do with mental illnesses. "
1512,"In terms of civil commitment false positives would mean that a person who does not have a mental illness, or is not a danger to themselves or others, would be civilly committed. This would be an unnecessary commitment and would deprive a sane person from their rights. In addition this person would be associated with stigma that does not pertain to them and would also be put under unnecessary scrutiny.   In terms of civil commitment a false negative would be when a person is not predicted to have a mental health issue and in reality they do have a mental health issue. This would affect the society at large because if the individual commits a violent crime then it reinforces the ""them v. us"" mentality described in previous lectures. In addition, the person would not receive the help they need and can be a danger to themselves or others. "
1513,"If I was not educated in this I think it might be a good idea, due to the stigma and the nature of the crime. But, now that I am more educated in this subject I know that it is not likely that sex offenders will continue to reoffend.  For example, many sexual offenders commit interfamilial crimes and become shunned from the family and do not continue to reoffend. Therefor, I think it is a bad idea. They are being punished for crimes they commit twice and we are also spending resources that could be spent on other more important issues. "
1514,"I think inpatient commitment deprives individuals of their liberty more than outpatient commitment does. I think outpatient is a better option to prevent getting to the point where inpatient commitment is necessary. Outpatient commitment can provide the PWMI the proper treatment to avoid their entrance into the criminal justice system where the majority of PWMI end up. Also, outpatient commitment allows people to continue their lives in society, in addition to being able to work while inpatient commitment confines PWMI to a hospital. "
1515," Inpatient commitment  Pros: Protects individuals who are dangerous to themselves or other and prevents people from hurting themselves. Protects society. Relieves the family and society from having to provide care for patients needs Cons: By definition involuntary inpatient commitment is coercive, and due to the coercive nature it may also be antitheraputic because it damages the patient therapist relationship. Stigma. Discrimination- Black are more likely to be hospitalized and treated with coercion.  Outpatient commitment  Pros:  Increases medication compliance and the likelihood of continuing treatment after the mandatory outpatient commitment.  Studies show that persons who suffer severe psychiatric illness who are committed as outpatients enjoy a better quality of life after commitment. Others studies report a depress in homelessness for outpatient patients as well as a decrease in criminal victimization for those PWMI.  Cons: Some say that this is unconstitutional because it infringes on the civil liberties although laws withstand challenges in court. It is also said to be antitheraputic due to the coercive nature and the force of medication. It also causes stigma.    Many of the cons are similar for both inpatient and outpatient civil commitment, which includes stigma. Therefor, I think it's important to start educating the public on mental illness in attempt to correct and possibly remove some of the stigma. If they experience less stigma then many PWMI might seek out treatment or they might not avoid treatment, which could also solve the coercive nature of civil commitment. In addition, I think it is important that they are being evaluated at every step of the process; before, during, and after. With this, they could see what type of individual would succeed better in which type of treatment.   "
1516,"Elise,  This is a great suggestion. I also think it is important for patients to be evaluated at every point of they're treatment. This could also avoid being in a treatment facility longer than they have to and being let out before they are ready. So, that when they are released they have the resources to continue their treatment and live their lives as members of society, hopefully this could also help to remove some of the effects of stigma.  I also like the comment you made about the AMA Journal of Ethics. I had not thought about that con. It could be difficult to put a PWMI in an environment they are not familiar, making it difficult to adjust to treatment. "
1517,"Viviana,  I really enjoyed reading your first paragraph because I think many people don't understand that involuntary commitment could help many people. I've started working as a dispatcher and have received many calls of people saying they feel like hurting themselves or others as well as many family members who are worried for their own safety or their safety of their loved ones because they are suffering from a mental illness and want to hurt themselves. When this happens we send out an officer and he makes the decision if the person is a danger to themselves or others and whether to call behavioral health and put them on a 5150 hold. If we did not have this in place, many people could hurt themselves or others so this is not only protecting the individual but society as well. Unfortunately there is some flaws to the policy, and I think you do a really good at laying it out.   Great post!"
1518,"I think when they first enter the criminal justice system and during adjudication would be the most difficult for a PWMI because they may be unaware of what they have done or that what they have done is wrong. It may also be difficult because that's when they interact with law enforcement officers or deputies who may not be trained to handle situations with PWMI. I also think the adjudication process may be difficult for multiple reasons. The most important reason being, they have to make a plea and may be unaware of the consequences of taking a guilty plea. Many public defenders do not tell their clients about consequences such as not being able to find housing, making it difficult to find employment, and restriction of liberties. For these reasons I think it may be difficult for PWMI to comprehend"
1519,"Challenges A potential challenge I see is difficulty getting treatment. County Behavioral Health facilities are usually understaffed and do not have the monetary or financial resources to continuously treat PWMI.  Jails are also smaller so they may not be staffed with full time staff leaving them unequipped to handle or treat PWMI efficiently or effectively.  Benefits PWMI will be less likely to be placed in prisons, due to the fact that they do not usually commit violent offenses. In addition they will likely serve shorter sentences. A potential benefit is that they would be seen by the County Behavioral Health and could possibly be educated about resources in the community they could use upon release. "
1520,"No, I don't think it's fair. I don't think it's fair to the officers or the PWMI. Most officers are not trained to handle PWMI, and it could be even more difficult when a the person is in a psychotic state. It's also not fair to the PWMI because they are sometimes unaware of the actions, not responsible for their actions, and also they are going without treatment.    As we have learned from the readings this week, when officers are not trained to deal with PWMI the officer usually uses more force of threat and is more likely to arrest the PWMI instead of referring them to county mental health. When officers are not trained it makes it difficult for them to understand why PWMI behave the way they do and they are unaware of how to handle the situation resetting to arresting the PWMI. "
1521,"They are related in that they stem from PWMI. CIT was developed to provide information on medications, provide officers with education in the signs and symptoms of mental illness, de-escalation techniques, and provides them with interaction consumers of mental health services. There is a stigma related to PWMI, one of them being that they are violent, which is generally untrue. They are also related in that CIT reduces stigma. Officers begin to understand and emphasize with those PWMI. I think this is a good step to reducing stigma in society. As we have mentioned before in order to reduce the stigma related to PWMI, we need to begin to educate society. As we have seen with CIT training, once they become educated in mental health and mental illness, stigma has been reduced. "
1522,"According to Taheri the goals of CTI are to reduce arrest of PWMI, reduce officer use of force, and minimize injuries to both civilian and officers. Taheri's ultimate findings were mixed  when evaluating  CIT training  and arrest of PWMI and officer use of force, in addition there is not enough evidence to significantly say that CIT training reduces officer injury when encountering PWMI. Although these Taheri's findings are mixed it seems that CIT trained officers are more likely to transport PWMI to more community-based services rather than arrest them. For this reason I think it is important to continue CIT training for officers. One of the suggestions made in the paper were to have departments clearly differentiate officers who are CIT trained so that the community is aware that they are trained to properly handle PWMI.  In my opinion it is important that research on the effectiveness of CIT training should continue. According to Taheri research on the effectiveness of CIT training is limited. Therefore, I believe CIT training should continue to be evaluated to understand what is helping and what is not in order to tweak the training and make it effective.  As long as it does not hurt the population then I think CIT training should continue.  As I have learned through out this weeks module, CIT training is lowering officers  perceived stigma of PWMI. Throughout this class we have continued to mention the stigma associated with PWMI and how education on PWMI can help diminish the stigma. Officers are usually the first contact PWMI have when it comes to the criminal justice system if officers can be trained in de-escalating situations they can be referred to mental health facilities where treatment can be provided instead of getting arrested and entering the criminal justice system. "
1523,"Hi Steve, Thanks for that little insight. I agree with your comments if anything this training at least helps in reducing stigma. Therefore, it should continue. "
1524,"Hi Steve, I agree with your post. I don't believe that CIT is not working, I think it's not resulting in all the outcomes we would want but it is at least reducing the stigma associated with PWMI. I think it is important, as Taheri suggested, that we continue to do research on CIT training. Hopefully, as more research is done we could figure out how to make it more effective in reducing not only stigma but officer use of force, lower arrest of PWMI, and injuries to civilians and officers.    Great post!"
1525,"Hi Alyse, I think you bring up an interesting point when it comes to the lack of research on CIT trainings. Taheri does mention this in his article and I think this may have a lot to do with the lack of significant findings in his research. For this reason, I think it is too difficult to say that CIT training is not working. I think we are noticing the reduction of stigma and additional referral to community-based programs so I think this is a step in the right direction for CIT training. With that said, it is important that research is continued on the topic as more agencies continue to implement CIT training to continue to understand its effectiveness, if any. In my opinion, as we continue to see a reduction in stigma and more referrals to community based programs we should slowly see less arrest of PWMI, and less use of force. "
1526,"Many people with severe mental illness end up living in poverty and on the streets and end up in jail for petty crimes. These people who have been jailed over 100 times probably consider jail their homes. It may also be the only way they can get any sort of treatment, even if it's minor, shelter and food. They were likely released from jail with a couple of pills and no knowledge of how to get treatment in the community. "
1527,1. Rates of recidivism in jails for PWMI. 2. Is the number of PWMI in jails/prison improving? 3. Look at the number of people seeking mental health care?
1528,"I think they are given just enough rights. In my opinion all their basic rights have not been taken away. I do think that sometimes their rights are too constricted, limited, or not upheld to a certain standard. For example, their right to medical or mental treatment. This right is often delayed until emergent because there is not enough staffing and many jails are over crowded. Many jails also leave inmates in solitary confinement for too long or they use it incorrectly or for the wrong reasons. Putting a PWMI in solitary confinement to ""protect him from other inmates."
1529,"I think it's the most common because it's the easiest solution. They give inmates medication that sedates them and they don't have to worry about psychosis, or behavioral problems associated with some mental illnesses. They don't have to provide inmates with other forms of treatment because giving them medication suffices their 8th amendment right to treatment. "
1530,"Realignment decreased the number of psychiatric beds available for PWMI. Now, PWMI are being funneled into the criminal justice system because there is not sufficient treatment options available in the community. After Realignment the jails had an overflow of PWMI entering jails for petty crimes. The jails were left with the burden of treating these PWMI while unequipped. It is not appropriate  for jails to have to be the de facto treatment facilities for PWMI because jails are generally underfunded and do not have enough staff that is trained to treat or interact with PWMI.  County jails are generally more underfunded than prisons because prisons get their funding from the state while jails get there funding from the county.  According to Torrey et al. (2010) mentaller ill inmates are more expensive to house because they need to increase staffing. psychiatric medications are significantly expensive, as well as psychiatric examination. In addition law suits are a potential expense when dealing with treatment of persons with mental illness or lack of treatment.  Persons with mental illness are usually frequent flyers, they have higher recidivism rates than other inmates. In addition, to having higher recidivism rates mentally ill inmates also stay longer mostly due to difficulties following rules and impaired thinking, additionally, they become major management problems (Torrey et al., 2010). Finally, mental ill inmates are also more likely to be abused by both other inmates and staff, and more likely to commit suicide.  Although, I believe it is inappropriate to use jails as treatments families for PWMI but with that said I think that has become the issue because after Realignment there is not enough resources in the community for PWMI to seek treatment. PWMI are not being able to seek treatment therefor their symptoms often reach their worst point and they end up in jail. Ideally there would be more families where PWMI can seek treatment and it would not get to the point where they are getting arrested and are difficult to handle because of their symptoms. Unfortunately, this is not the case and jails and prisons are the biggest source of treatment for PWMI. "
1531,"Elise, you bring up a good point. Although inappropriate jails are being left to treat and house persons with mental illness. Ideally, there would be proper treatment facilities for person with mental illness but after Realignment there isn't. Do you think that if jails were given more financial resources to use for treatment and housing PWMI it would be an appropriate way of treating PWMI and reduce recidivism rates for PWMI?"
1532,"Viviana, There is evidence that diversion programs are cost effective and more successful in treating PWMI but they are still not done nationwide. I'm curious if this would take funding away from already underfunded jails. Additionally, I think it is difficult and not practical/realistic for PWMI who commit crimes not to be arrested and sent to jail for these reasons I think it's important that there is better funding for jails to treat PWMI. I think a good alternative would be discharge planning for PWMI who are in jails. A challenge of Discharge planning is that it's limited to available resources in the community, therefor the best solution would be implementing more mental health treatment resources in the community. This would alleviate any pressure of the criminal justice systems contact with PWMI. "
1533,"I don't think it is necessarily fair, but I'm not sure what the alternative would be. They may not be 100% accurate but I think it's important to stray on the side of safety. I think risk assessment tools may only be necessary for some persons who commit crimes. For example, I've learned that the Static RR, a risk assessment tool used for sex offenders is not very accurate in predicting recidivism rates for sex offenders. So risk assessment tools may not be appropriate for sex offenders, because of the inaccuracy and it would result in taking away the rights of an individual who is not likely to reoffend. "
1534,"I'm not sure how receptive they would be. I think it is a necessary idea but I think the lack of resources might be important in considering how responsive mental health professionals are.  RNR takes into consideration other factors such as homelessness, abuse, and parental incarceration, these are factors that may need more than just mental health resources. "
1535,"I think probation might be a better option for PWMI due to the fact that the jail environment may exacerbate symptoms for PWMI. Additionally, if treatment is a condition in their probation PWMI will have to seek out treatment to help and address their mental illness without having to be housed in jail. "
1536,"No, I would not prefer a traditional court processing because I would rather be processed in a mental health court because those who receive treatment are more likely to do better and less lively to reoffend. The focus in a mental health court is rehabilitation, which is what I would want. I would want to treatment to be able to manage my symptoms in order to avoid the criminal justice system and be able to hold a job, housing, and medical benefits. "
1537,"Those with mental health illnesses have other factors besides the symptoms they suffer due to their illness that put them at an increased risk of committing crimes. Mentally ill individuals are more likely to be homeless in the past year, every physically abused, sexually abused, live in a foster home as a child, have a parent who is incarcerated, have parents who suffer from substance abuse, and have a substance abuse disorder themselves than non-mentally ill individuals. According to Peterson et al. (2014) only about 7.5% of crimes committed by mentally ill persons are directly caused or proceeded by the symptoms of their illness. For this reason, Peterson et al. (2014) suggest that treatment for persons with mental illness focuses not only on their symptoms but other risk factors as well. Risk Needs Responsivity (RNR) looks at these risk factors, which also contribute to an increased risk of committing crimes.  Therefor, I would propose this model to the Chief Probation Officer when considering the types of conditions for probation for person with mental illness. An emphasis on the condition o f treatment, including the RNR model to focus on the proper treatment for the individual and include a focus on the publics safety, while reducing recidivism and cost.  Additionally, I would advice the Chief Probation Officer that probationers who are in a specialty probation program are less likely than traditional probationers to be arrested and caution him that unfortunately, there is no known effect on violence. According to Skeem et al. (2017) traditional probationers are more than two times more likely to be rearrested than specialty probationers and there is no significant effect on violence. Ultimately, the research shows that the crimes committed by PWMI are rarely followed or due to the symptoms of their mental illness therefor when treating PWMI it is important to look at the other risk factors associated with PWMI to ensure public safety. "
1538,"Eva,  I agree with your post in that it is important to treat both the symptoms of PWMI and treat the “criminogenic” risk factors. If this is included in a specialty probation for PWMI, they may be able to reintegrate into society better than traditional probationers whose probation focuses on correcting behavior instead of treatment. Additionally, probation officers who focus on specialty probation have smaller case loads than traditional probation officers, which would allow them to focus on the PWMI on parole and provide them with additional services.  I also agree that there needs to be more research done on RNR. After reading about this I'm faced with the questions comparing RNR to solely symptom based treatment. Questions such as, Compared to models who only focus on treating symptoms and the RNR model who has lower recidivism rates? Who is better reintegrated into society? Does treating symptoms have an affect on violence where RNR doesn't?  What do you think?"
1539,"Elise, your post made me wonder if there were no significant effects on violence, due to the fact that the majority of PWMI are not violent. The crimes they commit are usually low level misdemeanors such as trespassing. In my opinion things become violent when approach with untrained officers that are not experienced with responding to PWMI. Do you think this might be something to consider? I also like that you mention stability as the common denominator. I also think that all models of treatment and probation have stability as their main goal. The goal of traditional probation is to maintain steady employment and housing and the goal of specialized probation is to get emotionally stable as well as economically stable. Specialized probation that focuses on mental illness has the goal to ensure stability in PWMI, whether it be by providing housing, medication or therapy. The goal of specialized probation that focuses on substance abuse is to ensure the probationer is sober, so that they can live a stable life.  Good post!"
1540,"In my opinion, prisoners might aggravate the condition of PWMI due to the environment and structure of prison. For example, it may be difficult for PWMI to follow rules and the environment of a prison may exacerbate their symptoms. In addition, correctional officers may not know or have the proper training in identifying symptoms and when disciplinary actions need to be taken, many PWMI are put into administrative segregation (sometime's for their own protection) but being in administrative segregation may make it more difficult for PWMI to cope. "
1541,"I don't think they can truly be rehabilitated. I think they can help become managed but never completely rehabilitated. I think having a criminal record already makes it difficult to be rehabilitated, due to difficulty getting good jobs when they are released having a mentally illness makes it a lot more difficult and harder to become a member of society."
1542,"I think the disadvantages far outweigh the advantages of solitary confinement. The disadvantages have a lot more detrimental effects on inmates, specifically in their mental health which can sometimes lead to physical injuries. The only potential advantage I see with solitary confinement is not having to deal with the problem they just put them away in a box for 23hrs/day, but I think that leads to having to deal with the potential consequences such as the effects it has on the inmates. "
1543,"Personally, I would rather treatment could be provided outside of the prison system. In my opinion, I would rather put my tax dollars on evidence based practices outside of the prison system and emphasize preventative treatment. I would rather have my tax dollars help PWMI before their illness gets so bad they become involved with the system."
1544,"I think the best option to keep both inmates with mental illnesses and staff would be a separate residential environment. Having correctional facilities with therapeutic environments such as, special housing units to provide residential treatment and supportive living units for inmates with mental illnesses. To maintain cost I suggest using screening tools, assessment tools, and classification systems to properly diagnose and treat the inmates with mental illness. If they are classified as having a mental illness they should be put in a separate housing unit with staff better equipped or trained to handle PWMI, potentially even have full time psychologist and/or psychiatrist on staff. A lot of the State prisons mental health budget is spent on medication that sedates prisoners with mental illness, a separate housing unit may lessen the need for sedative type medications due to a safer and treatment based environment they will be in. The general population is a stressful environment that may serve as an onset or even exacerbate symptoms of PWMI that may lead to difficulty in following prison rules and be in violent altercations or fights causing them to get infraction and serve longer sentences. Mentally ill prisoners are known to serve longer sentence and additionally are more expensive to keep in prison. Therefor, a separate housing unit may be more cost effective in the long run and can potentially reduce recidivism rates as well.  In my opinion PWMI aren't necessarily receiving more resources than other inmates. They are getting treated as if they were having a general illness. For example, a patient with a sore throat, broken bone, diabetes, maybe even cancer. They get more programs and receive more resources because they need it, this is the case with prisoners who have mental illnesses. Mental health treatment is protection available to prisoners under the 8th amendment so I do believe they should receive the resources needed. Furthermore, it is just as difficult if not more for PWMI to receive treatment outside of prison therefor resources should be allocated in attempt to treat and rehabilitate these individuals in order to reduce recidivism rates and cost associated with housing prisoners with mental illness. "
1545,"Stephanie, you bring up good points. I also think inmates with mental illness should be segregated from the general population. On the other hand I think it's important that we specify that they should be in therapeutic environments and not separated as in administrative segregation or solitary confinement. Many inmates with mental illnesses are put in solitary confinement because they get in fights, receive infractions, or to ""protect"" them from other inmates who ""pick on"" them, but as we have learned this may make symptoms worse. When inmates with mental illnesses are put in solitary confinement their symptoms are exacerbated to the highest level, they begin to hallucinate, become delusional, severely depressed, begin to self mutilate, and commit suicide. In addition, the resources and programs begin allocated for inmates with mental illness should emphasize therapeutic and rehabilitative natures. "
1546,"Hi Wendy,  After reading your post, specifically the parts of reintegration, I seem to agree with you to a certain extent. I agree that successful reintegration into society should be a goal of the mental health department in correctional facilities. You mention having correction officers and clinicians can assist with this it may minimize recidivism rates. I wonder how you think they may be able to do so? Do you think that separating inmates with mental illnesses from the general population until they can properly be reintegrated? If so, do you think they should attempt to reintegrate them into general population in prison before they are released or keep them separated until they are released and see if they reintegrate in the outside world? Or should they be treated while in the general population?"
1547,"I think this is a good idea. I think that the new construction would allow for better treatment of PWMI. Fulton State Hospital was first built to restrain and focused on housing PWMI, now it will be safer and allow for more humane and effective treatment, including as was mentioned group therapy. Therefor, I would feel as if my tax dollars were being put to a good cause. "
1548,"No, I definitely would not. When you are found not guilty by reason of insanity you have to be treated in attempt to restore competency. Therefor those who are found not guilty by insanity end up serving more time in a state mental hospital than would have if sentenced to a regular prison sentence. When found not guilty by reason of insanity you are not set free and allowed to go home, so it is not really a get out of jail free card. "
1549,"Well I think if there are correctional officers present while patients are getting treatment may be necessary. Additionally, they should me handcuffed. I know being restrained is not good for PWMI but I think it may be necessary as long as it is minimum. For example, when I did my internship at a CDCR prison when meeting with a patient in mental health they are in a private room but the door is open and there are correctional officers outside of the door. The inmates also have to have their hands visible at all times, usually they have to have them on the table in front of them. When I went to the ad seg unit they were put into a small cell which helps ensures the safety of both the inmate and the staff. "
1550,"I think its a good idea for patients who have no other options. I think it should only be used as a last resort, medication and therapy should still be tried for multiple years before deep brain stimulation is considered as an option. But overall I do think this should be used because usually the candidates for this procedure have attempted suicide in the past or are considering it and this could save their lives. As mentioned in the video it is still unknown how it works or why it works therefor it should be used with cautioned and throughly explained and there should be multiple follow ups, but I do think it should be an option for the most severe cases. "
1551,"The majority of patients in state hospitals are forensic patients. Forensic patients make up about 90% of the population in state hospitals while civilly committed patients only make up about 10% of the population in state hospitals. No, I don't think state hospital should be used exclusively or almost exclusively for forensic patients. I think state hospitals should be reconstructed to suit not only forensic patients but have a separate wing for inpatient treatment of persons with severe mental illness. Most state hospitals are built like prisons, they are isolated geographically, and their layout is not beneficial to treatment. The staff at state hospitals also suffer from a shortage making it difficult to build rapport with patients and difficult to maintain due to high caseloads. Therefor, I think state hospitals should go through a reconstruction in order to better able to treat all kinds of patients. State hospitals should be used for a variety of patients, not exclusively forensic patients because it is well equipped to handle very disturbed patients who may be a danger to themselves or other, it allows for families of PWMI to have a break from caring for their mentally ill family member, or removes the mentally ill from a disturbing  home situations, and they would be better equipped to diagnose upon entry, deliver medication, and serve as a supportive environment for patients. I think it is important for state hospitals to have the room and proper capacity and staffing to treat PWMI before they commit crimes. In addition to serving the needs of forensic patients, such as restoring competency, state hospitals should also be therapeutic in nature with efforts to rehabilitate PWMI who are not part of criminal justice system. With efforts to rehabilitate PWMI, they may become more stable and upon release will better be able to be a functioning member of society. Therefor, may possibly be able to prevent criminal behavior and possibly reduce the intake of PWMI in prisons or jails. In my opinion state hospitals should also allow voluntary commitment for persons with severe mental illness who need a more intense form of therapy, allow for more civilly committed patients, and either reduce the amount of forensic patient intake or expand and grow the hospitals to allow for housing of more occupants. "
1552,"Serenity, I enjoyed reading your post. I feel like your thoughts on this are very similar to mine. I also believe that state hospitals should not operate exclusively or mostly for forensic patients, they should also include treatment for patients who need to be voluntarily committed because they are not benefiting or getting the proper treatment in community based programs and may benefit from a more intense type of therapy. I also wrote how this may reduce the population of PWMI in the criminal justice system. Did you take this into consideration? Do you think the community may benefit from hospitals being open to state hospitals? "
1553,"Viviana,  You bring up a good point I had not thought of. When inmates who are mentally ill, are released they have a difficult time managing their treatment and receiving their medication. This could be a good resource for them to use upon release. Additionally you mention state hospitals being used for those who are at risk for becoming involved with the criminal justice system. I was wondering if you knew of a way to assess this risk? and how it would be assessed? Or if you had any ideas on how this could be done? I know we've learned about risk assessment throughout different courses within this program, but we've also learned how they may not be very accurate."
1554,I think the idea of the forms for sharing resources and information amongst organizations sound like a good solution to linking the CJ system and MH system but I think the confidentiality of information makes it difficult to be efficient and effective. I think a possible solution may be having access to different organizations for example the jail/prison and the county mental health clinicians but possibly stationing a member of the mental health clinician at the jail or another employee who has specific clearance to the confidential information. 
1555,The dispatcher was aware of the possible need for specially trained officers and dispatched the appropriate officers. The officers approached the subject cautiously and patiently. The officer calmly talked to the subject and tried to figure out the issues with the subject and advised them of the resources available to them. 
1556,"I think one of the biggest difficulties is lack of staffing, meaning they are constantly short staffed, therefor making trainings difficult.  Additionally there is a lot of concerns, steps, and trainings to consider and improve on. It takes a court order because it takes someone demanding that they are not getting the proper treatment necessary.  In addition the correctional officers may not be aware of the signs of mental illnesses and may possibly confuse them with behavioral problems. Their are many possible reasons but lack of proper staffing, training, and awareness are in my opinion the biggest difficulties in changing the treatment of PWMI. "
1557,"Some challenges may be safety, providing appropriate services for treatment, having a diversity of treatment options, and having a proper environment for treatment.  Cross training may help by preparing mental health workers with the skills and mind set needed to work in correctional facilities. Cross training may also help in understanding the variety of organizations and effectively being able to work in different environments and uphold the different set of standards for different roles."
1558,"The biggest problem is the lack of knowledge the criminal justice system and the public have in regards to PWMI therefore educating the criminal justice system, particularly those who come in contact with PWMI such as dispatchers and officers should be the first goal set forth in training, Being aware of the variety of mental illnesses and the symptoms associated with those illnesses is necessary for officers for many reasons including safety of the officers, PWMI, and other citizens in the area. Once these people become knowledgeable in identifying mental illnesses they should be trained in intervening with PWMI.    According to Watson and Fulambarker (2013 ) the  Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) model is considered a ""best practice"" model. CIT models emphasize the safety of officers and referral of community treatment options in order to divert entrance of PWMI into jails or prisons.  I believe CIT trainings may be beneficial to PWMI who come in contact with law enforcement because this model involves training of officers  (awareness and de-escalation techniques) and sometimes includes dispatchers (identifying mental disturbance calls) , change in department procedures, and involves collaboration of local law enforcement with community health providers. Because CIT models include mental health professionals it is important they available o assist when needed. The main goal of the criminal justice system should be to treat PWMI and avoid entrance in jails/prisons. Therefore if officers are doing their part in identifying psychological issues mental health providers should do their part in treating these individuals.    Currently, I've noticed that the only way officers are referring PWMI to treatment is if they are put in a 5150 hold. In order to be placed on a 5150 an individual must be a danger to himself or others, or gravely disabled. Symptoms should not be so severe that they cannot take care of themselves and are considered dangerous. Officers should be able to and trained to refer PWMI who are not yet considered dangerous but are obviously struggling.     "
1559,"Steve, I can tell that this is something you've taken time to consideration and have looked at this with a 360 degree view. With that said you bring up a lot of possible aspects trainings should involve and I think they are all good ideal and would greatly improve the way PWMI are treated and the safety of both PWMI and officers. Do you think this training plan may be practical?  Your said time allocation would be the most inhibiting factor but I think resource allocation and funding might be the greatest difficulty in implementing such a extensive plan. "
1560,"Natalie, your main reason for implementing the CIT Model and the NAMI-Indiana Training program seems to be the reduction of use of force methods. I also believe this is an important factor to consider when implementing new training methods.  In my opinion I consider treatment the biggest motivation for training methods. I see that safety seems to be the common denominator for both models suggested but if you could choose what would you consider the best motivator for implementing a new training method? What would be the goal of your training method?"
1561,"I think they focus on non-violent offenders because as we have learned the majority of PWMI are not violent. For the most part they get into trouble for misdemeanors such as trespassing or petty theft because they are likely homeless or living in poverty. Their focus is on treating PWMI who just need to get their symptoms situated. Additionally, programs such as CIT models emphasize officer safety, which may also be a contributing factor as to why they focus on non-violent offenders.    I think violent offenders should also have the chance to better their lives. I think to ensure officer safety they should be taken to regular jails and once they are better behaved should be taken to diversion programs. "
1562,"I think they are very similar but I think it may be more difficult to implement evidence-based practices in the criminal justice system. I think it requires more training and more resources. They may need the cooperation of more than just their own agency, such as community mental health services. Additionally, I think it may be harder to approve and begin an evidence-based practice. "
1563,"I think it would be largely beneficial to the criminal justice system. I've learned that PWMI often also suffer from substance abuse and it it important to treat both illnesses for treatment to be successful. I think if co-occuring approaches were implemented recidivism rates would decline and more people would be able to receive proper treatment that may improve their living situations and live a relatively normal lifestyle. I think this may also reduce crime rates, specifically property crimes because I know this is a common crime perpetrated by those suffering from substance use. "
1564,I think it would help in reducing stigma through education and awareness. They would experience what life with someone who is experiencing mental illness is and understand what they experience. As more and more people become peer mentors of PWMI more and more people will be educated in the aspect and additionally they may be able to spread awareness to others. 
1565,"The main points of the recommendations proposed in the paper of the American College of Physicians was to integrate behavioral health care into primary care, to promote funding through public and private health insurance payers and policymakers, and to increase research in order to find the most effective and efficient approaches to integrate behavioral health care in the primary care setting. I think if these policies were implemented there would be fewer involvement of mentally ill persons in the criminal justice system. Comorbid illnesses would be identified earlier and treatment could be implemented and more easily accessible with coverage from state funding and insurance policies. Additionally, if research is supported there would find more effective ways of incorporating treatment for behavioral problems into primary care leading to more effective treatment. The focus here would now be on preventative care, which would likely reduce PWMI in the CJ system along with possibly heightening life spans as treatment of comorbid physical and mental health would be integrated and treated.  This may give PWMI the opportunity to get treatment instead of being sent to prison or jail, or possibly make treatment in the CJ system better equipped with more resources.  This would also benefit PWMI who are released from prison as they often have difficulties finding treatment or refilling their prescriptions due to lack of insurance. As, I said this would reduce recidivism rates of PWMI who reoffend due to their symptoms. "
1566,"Viviana,  I had not thought about your last point that prison primary care doctors will learn how to effectively apply evidence based psychological treatment. This made me think of these recommendations through a bigger lense. Originally, I was thinking insurance payers and policies would be changed in order to have access to mental health related care but I failed to think of the chances of cross training primary physicians to identify and treat or at minimum refer to treatment of those who are additionally experience mental health problems.  This emphasizes the importance of being able to identify possible behavioral problems that may be associated with mental illnesses because this will affect treatment of a comorbid problem.  Good post!"
1567,"Steve,  You bring up some good points. I wonder if you have given thought to how breaking barriers to payment and funding would benefit the holistic approach?  Also the paper emphasizes primary physicians only addressing behavioral health issues within their limits of their competency and resources. Obviously this would vary among each professional, but do you think this would result in an increase in  primary care physicians attempting to treat and prescribing medication to people who suffer from mental health illnesses? "
1568,"Similar to what the mother of Timothy Souders said about the prison not meaning to kill her son. The point is that they did. They did not just kill her son but also other prisoners who have a mental illness. I believe if Timothy Souders was initially taken to an asylum or hospital when being arrested and not taken to prison would have prevented him from dying. Souders showed signs of distress while being arrested, such as saying to shoot him because he wanted to die. He should have never gone to prison because they are not equipped to handle PWMI. However, since he was taken to prison, the prison still failed Souders since the mental health staff was never consulted and notified about his conditions. As the previous prison psychiatrists said, it should not matter if the current psychiatrist was on leave; they should have been replaced since they are critical to inmates who have a mental illness. Lastly, I believe Souders could have also been saved if they took him to the hospital during his last days. The guards should have known how long he was going without water and should have admitted him into a hospital to get what he needed. "
1569," Non-medical considerations have been driven by provisions of treatment and care for persons with mental illness. A common theme that showcased these provisions were highlighted in Behind Closed Doors: A look inside Insane Asylum of the 19th Century. Which were whether asylums are accurately treating the insane or silencing those who challenged the status quo. The individuals who were in the asylums during the 19th century varied across the board — having individuals who actually have mental illness like having manic episodes, as well as, having wives who disobeyed their husbands and went against the word of Christianity. To me, this shows how the current societal norm affects the provision of treatment and care for persons with mental illness. At the time they believed, the women who were acting out were mentally ill because they did not conform to the norm. This raises many issues in helping PWMI because treatments for them are generally created to address these issues of nonconformity. However, when it comes to people with mental illness there is not one answer. We see this with support for mental health treatment fluctuating year by year because of the political party in power agenda. Political parties play a huge role in the types of treatment and care PWMI receive so this form of non-medical consideration needs to be addressed as well."
1570,"   In terms of reducing gun violence, I do not think the benefits of a national registry of mentally ill persons outweigh the costs. Currently, most U.S. citizens believe that gun violence and mental illness are linked despite the lack of evidence. One of the main supports for a national registry can be due to the media coverage on individuals who have committed violence with guns blaming mental illness for their actions. However, only 3-5% of PWMI commit violence offenses in the United States. When looking at a specific situation like the one described in The Truth About Mental Illness and Guns, we can see the consequences of the registry and the limitations it has. The Armed Prohibited Person System in California showcased these consequences when Phillips was mandated to turn over their guns. He had to turn over his weapons because Mrs. Phillips voluntary committed herself when she changed her prescription medicine to help her anxiety. Despite her voluntary committing herself to the facility, she soon realized that they have involuntarily held her for a 51-50. The police surrounded their house, embarrassing them in front of their neighbors, making it more difficult for them to live a “normal” day-to-day life. This is where I believe we see a societal error when it comes to dealing with people with a mental illness. Even though she tries to get help, she is then looked at as a violent person when that is not the case at all. This stereotype can also be applied to a national registry of the mentally ill because then this demographic is looked at as violent. Currently, I question would this still be a question if the government wanted to create a registry of people of a specific ethnicity? The record can develop a form of discrimination among a population-based on little to no evidence."
1571," One of the most important problems to fix as a result of deinstitutionalization is the fear and stigma society has on people with mental illness. We are no longer looking at PWMI as people, and we are labeling them as an illness or a type of outsider. By having this us vs. them, mentality makes it harder to address the problem. We need to fix this problem because, like any other person, we do not need to be excluding people from our communities. Instead, we need to be helping them rehabilitate to the best of their abilities back into society. Crystal Dieleman stated there is a link to the violence of people who are excluded from their communities. Currently, PWMI is being eliminated, so as a result, it may end up in the CJ system due to this issue.     Another problem we need to fix is no longer criminalizing PWMI, and addressing the issue head-on. Giving them resources they need to help address their issues and making it easier for them to live and improve their day-to-day lives. Similar to people who do not have a mental illness, PWMI were found to need: safe, secure housing, structure and meaningful activities, gainful employment, interpersonal relationships, social connectedness, autonomy, and agency, and empowering and good relationships with service providers (Crystal Dieleman, TedTalk). By providing them with resources to feel included in their community can help address the criminalization of PWMI."
1572," Despite mental illness being highly familiar among society, the stigma imposed on individuals by society affects how the person with a mental illness self-determines themself. People with mental illness need to acknowledge their diagnosis to help bridge a gap between stigmas around mental illness. Not only do PWMI need to accept their diagnosis, but society does as well. Once the community has a better understanding and grasps the dynamics of mental illness, we can begin to develop responses to help improve mental illness. Similar to what was discussed in  Untangling Gun Violence from Mental Illness . Beck (2016) showcases the dangers of stereotypes of PWMI. How psychiatric disorders are seen more as a societal threat, even though there is more risk to the individual with the illness. PWMI can feel as if they are being targeted as a threat to society when there is little to no evidence to support this stance. Throughout history, mental illness has been blamed, punished, and dehumanized by society (Slate, Buffington-Vollum & Johnson, 2013).     As early as the pre-civilization era, people were unsure of the causes of mental illness and how they would be able to manage them. With little knowledge surrounding mental illness during the time, some tribal groups believed it seemed from evil spirits (Slate et al., 2013). The people in charge of dealing with PWMI were those in the tribe or family of the individual. If the individual was deemed unmanageable and threatened, the well0being of the tribe often resulted in them being banned or put to death. Unlike the society during the pre-civilization era, during ancient civilization, the Greeks and Romans saw mental illness more as an illness and less as something spiritual. People like Plato and Hippocrate believed PWMI should be cared for and nurtured rather than banished. During the ancient civilization era, families were still held responsible for being the first aid to PWMI. However, we began to see governments more involved with PWMI. From the readings this week, I believe PWMI during this era may have felt like they were more of as a member of society than a PWMI during the pre-civilization period. During the ancient civilization era, PWMI wishes were being listened to. Slate et al. (2013) discussed how the Romans pointed a guardian to t"
1573,"Stephanie,  You stated in your last paragraph that people with mental illnesses should be allowed their self-determination and not only be viewed through societies that have given stereotypes. All of which I agree with, however, I do question how we would be able to make this shift. Since mental illness has always been looked at as something as non conforming,  what are some steps you believe we can make to help change this? I have recently watched the new movie  The Joker, all of which highlight mental illness. However, after reading this week's readings and watching the videos provided, I still see today the myths surrounding mental illness. This particular movie just came out this weekend, and we are still portraying mental illness incorrectly. We learned this past week that PWMI needs that sense of community to feel as if they are not alienated from society. However, until these myths of mental illness are addressed, I believe we cannot move forward as a society. Inevitably I think PWMI would have a challenging time trying to create self-determination for themself if they do not have a community of support behind them. Overall great post! "
1574,"Elise, Great post! Like yourself, I highlighted how individuals were perceived as mentally ill if they did not conform to the societal norms. The video we watched in this week's lecture,  Behind Closed Doors: A look inside Insane Asylum of the 19th Century, showcased this stereotype. I began to think about more than just PWMI when I heard this during this week's lecture. For instance, I began to think about minorities all together (people of color) who have been affected by the criminal justice system at a higher rate than their white counterparts. I believe I have been looking at the way we deal with PWMI as a Criminal Justice System issue when, in fact, it is a societal issue. Like you said in your post, when an individual does not fit the expectation of societal norms, they are either banned, shunned, or harmed. We see individuals who try to stand against the standards become targeted and stereotyped as a threat to society when that is not always the case. All of which PWMI falls victim to. The article we read this week,  Untangling Gun Violence from Mental Illness, showcases the harmful effects of these stereotypes society puts on mental illness that inaccurately portrays them. This ultimately makes it easier for the community to agree to funnel PWMI through the criminal justice system since they are seen as a threat instead of sending them to places to help aid their condition. Now I am wondering if it is as simple as educating society with facts about PWMI that can help change these stereotypes. Do you believe so? And if not, what steps would you use to help diminish these myths? "
1575,"It may be challenging to do so, but I think PWMI would benefit from a little mandated treatment for their mental illness. Something along the lines of having them go to either a form of therapy (whether group or alone). From previous lecture videos, we see that when PWMI is around others who have gone through what they have, they would be more willing to ask for help if they needed it. However, I do not believe we should mandate them to take medication if they do not want to. Providing them with the option to try remedy seems ideal. If we would prescribe medicines to PWMI, then this can be seen as cruel and unusual. We learned in lecture video 2-4 that persons with a mental illness already distrust the system because of their paranoia. If we were making them take medication, they could feel as if we are poisoning them or something along those lines. If we were able to get them in a room with other PWMI, they could see they aren't alone. Lastly, for PWMI who are incarcerated and found to be suffering from a substance abuse disorder, the prison system should mandate them to NA. While they are in prison, we should be focusing on how to help them with their substance abuse issue since approximately 75% of persons with MI suffer from substance abuse disorder. "
1576,"Based on the video of the US Army Infantryman, who discusses his experience with PTSD, I would recommend group therapy for people who were in the military. Not for just for service members who were deployed overseas but every service member. We understand there is a public stigma around troops. Personally, my father and two stepbrothers were in the military. Each had confessed when something was bothering them, or even if they were physically hurt, they would never report it. Troops believe they have to be the toughest they can be, whether that is good for them or not. It was not until thirty years later with a supportive family; my father started getting assistance from the VA for his PTSD. Similar to the serviceman in the video, troops come home with PTSD and depression. We need to end the stigma, not only for soldiers but PWMI that it is okay to ask for help. When service members have nowhere to turn to, they generally resort to substance abuse. The man in the video said he was diagnosed with PTSD, and instead of taking the medication, he resorted to drinking his life away. He only started to get help for his MI when he got together with people who went through similar struggles. This is why I would recommend mental health treatment for active military members would be a type of therapy with service members who went through the same scenarios as themselves. For instance, if people were in the war or were deployed, they would have classes with people who were in the war or deployed. To me, this seems to help people realize they are not alone and gives them the opportunity to not to feel ashamed to ask for help. "
1577,"I think the movement toward reducing benefits for mental health care is ridiculous. Cutting these benefits from places like Medicaid, where approx 50% of all public mental health allocations come from. From the Social video report: in crisis, out of room one of the advocates for PWMI stated: ""if it were for people with cancer, the general public would be appalled."" This, to me, accurately shows policymakers' view on the worthiness of PWMI vs. other health care. I would like to see the statics of people with cancer and people who suffer from mental illness and compare the two. We need to start viewing MI as what it is, an illness. Furthermore, since benefits to mental health care are limited, showcased in Social report: in crisis, out of the room. We saw PWMI waiting weeks or even months to get a bed. How much more are we going to take away from them? Not only are PWMI benefits for mental health care are limited but also they are limited civil rights. Such as, the right to serve on a jury, to vote, the right to hold office, parental rights, and the right to remain married. PWMI is already limited to benefits that a non-PWMI does not have to deal with. We need to show PWMI that their worth is equal to everyone else. "
1578,"President Obama's call to action for ending mental illness stigma was a significant step toward trying to stop the stigma of mental illness. However, I do not think it is enough. Calling for an end to mental illness is the first step. It is going to be a complicated and lengthy process to trying to end the stigma of PWMI since it roots from the ancient Greece era. Stigma back then toward PWMI was cynical about the moral character of the bearer and continued to be like that for centuries after. I believe the president can bring effective change to ending the stigma by talking about PWMI as what it is, universal. As well as openly discussing the effects of shame on the PWMI. Such as limiting their access to opportunities and resources, economic poverty, limiting interpersonal connections, and resulting in less than full participation in society. Bringing attention to how much stigma affects an individual can be a great start. Also, when discussing health care reform as any president does, they should be prioritizing mental health care. People can then see mental health care as a priority, like any other form of health care. One president can only do so much, so once they bring attention to the issue at hand, people can start to end the stigma around PWMI. Eventually, we can help persons with mental illness begin getting the right assistance they need."
1579," There are four forms of stigma when it comes to PWMI: public stigma, structural stigma, label avoidance, and self-stigma. Each type of stigma plays a role in the way others see PWMI and how PWMI perceive themselves. People with mental illnesses face many challenges to function successfully in society as well as deal with the struggles of their diagnosis alone (Rusch et al., 2005). Three common misconceptions of PWMI: they should be feared, rebellious, and have a childlike perception, so they need to be cared for.      Structural stigma is stigma brought about by rules, policies, or procedures of private or governmental institutions (Slate et al., 2013). This form of stigma restricts the opportunities of people with mental illness, whether it is intentional or not. Examples of structural stigma discussed last and this week is the massive underfunding of the mental health system. Such as the increase of emergency room visits for PWMI due to lack of resources. PWMI has been found to have an increase of 56% in the number of emergency room visits across the country. This is an issue for PWMI because they are not receiving the adequate care they need for their illness. Experts believe PWMI need facilities to provide 24 hours structured, acute, lock-down care. Instead, they are either getting physicians with general knowledge about their illness or nothing at all. PWMI are continually being shoved to the side when it comes to health care; this was showcased in the video  Social Report: In Crisis, Out of Room . Parents were trying to get attention for their child who suffered from a mental illness and found getting help for them would take weeks to months. An advocate for PWMI stated, “If it was for cancer patients, people would be appalled.” This is where I see the public’s stigma surrounding mental illness very apparent.     The negative consequences of structural stigma played a massive role in creating the current public stigma of PWMI. Due to the “Not in my backyard” mentality, and federal funds not reaching community health centers the way they were intended to be, the streets were exposed to PWMI. Who were beforehand hidden from the general public (Slate et al., 2013). This is where we saw a massive shift from the institutionalization"
1580,"Danielle, I think one of the ways we can help address the stigma of mental health is by mandating it in every school. For example, having a course, or as a term-long, discussing mental health. At the beginning of your article, you stated how you believe some schools merge mental health curriculum into health classes. However, health classes are also being cut from schools (e.g., my highschool). We tend to get a lot of our public health information online nowadays. I find myself trying to diminish mental illness myths among people of the younger generation since they receive public stigma for PWMI through media. I like how you discussed having people come in to talk about mental health; instead of just having one teacher. Rusch et al. (2005) discussed stigma busters, which aimed to educate the public to diminish stigmatizing conditions. Having these stigma busters come into schools to address the issues can be seen as more reliable to students. Since they deal with PWMI daily, whereas some teachers do not. It was also found how even brief educational courses on mental illness prived to reduce stigmatizing attitudes among their participants (Rusch et al., 2005).  Do you think it would be ideal to educate children when they are in elementary school because they are still forming their belief system compared to high school students? Or do you believe it should be a constant discussion throughout their entire education? Overall great post!"
1581,"Briana,  I do question how effective we would be if we started educating students at a young age about mental health. I think we need to go beyond adding mental health into the curriculum and discussing it publicly. There are many positive effects to addressing mental health in a general setting than just a school one. Rusch et al. (2005) examined how it would be more useful for participants who have a better knowledge of mental illness before education. Or he believes coming into contact with PWMI can also be an effective method. How do you think the public would respond if we would put someone with a mental illness in front of students. I would like to note that I would be okay with it, but I question the opinions of others due to the public stigma.   Furthermore, the content of education also needs to be addressed. We learned this week the consequences of making mental illness rooting from a genetic standpoint because it then separates us. It is resulting in the ""us"" vs. ""them"" mentality. Like yourself, I discussed the ""us"" vs. ""them"" thinking and how we should be addressing this because of the adverse effects it has on the PWMI. I think to call to action the impact of isolating a particular demographic is needed. As well as, trying to provide a form of solution for the public to better themselves is a great start!"
1582," I have seen similar figures to the one described within the lecture and the video. When looking at civil commitment on the surface, it is based on the false premise that mental health professionals and by extension, the court can predict who may become a danger in the future. I think it is essential to understand the pros and cons of specificity and sensitivity when applying it to real-world situations. When we are looking at implementing the figure to aspects of life like civil commitment and mental health, we need to understand what we are doing. Problematic areas, false positives, and false negatives, can raise issues within society.  In terms of representation of risk to individual and organization, false positive and negatives reflect people we see in our day to day lives. For instance, if the community believes we should civilly commit someone based on a false positive, we are committing people who do not deserve to be. Additionally, if we have an individual who falls within the category of a false-negative, there would be a huge public outcry. Since they may need to be civilly committed, but we chose to let them go. Basing policy on statistics like these, we need to realize they are more than just percentages and numbers; they are people. I do, however, understand that we need some form of way to help with this issue, I am just unsure how. Within the video, we saw first hand what happens if we alter the sensitivity and specificity. If we were to raise the sensitivity, we would see fewer false negatives; however, it decreases specificity. When discussing civil commitment, we should take all of these factors into consideration and look at what we are missing. "
1583," I believe it was this past term where we learned about the involuntary commitment of sex offenders after they completed their sentences. We watched a video around individuals who were deemed an SVP and looked at the psychiatric facilities holding them. It was interesting to see this first hand because I just assumed after they completed their sentence, they were released. I think sex offenders, after they complete their sentences, should not be involuntarily committed. In my opinion, they are serving a sentence twice when they are involuntarily committed. Similar to California’s use of civil commitment for DVP, sex offenders have two sets of punishment. One for the crimes they are known to have committed and one for the people, and the legal system believes them to be. Involuntary civil commitment is telling sex offenders they are their biggest mistake, and there is no room to change. Within the video, they discuss how they have classes while they are involuntarily committed to try and help ease their urges. Once their sentence is completed, they are transferred to a psychiatric hospital and held indefinitely and evaluated ass an SVP. I believe they should be doing this while they are serving their time if the public and legal system are discussing trying to rehabilitate them back into society. I do not think them sitting in prison for years, and then when they complete their sentence is when their rehabilitation should begin. "
1584," Based on the lectures and videos from this week, I believe outpatient commitment is a more extensive reach of state authority into an individual's liberty. Outpatient commitment is not preferred to inpatient commitment because outpatient commitment is coercive. For instance, since OC plans cannot be enforced, so some courts use contempt for noncompliant individuals.  It has also been found to be non-therapeutic and disempowering, whereas inpatient treatment uses more treatment to help people in need. However, inpatient treatment is for individuals who are so sick that develope suicidal thoughts or thoughts of harming others. These individuals fail to care for themselves, which is why the state steps in to help intervene. One major con with inpatient treatment is individuals do not get to continue their freedom within the community as if they were an outpatient commitment. Each form of commitment has its pros and cons. I do think outpatient commitment reaches more into an individual's liberty because it is based on coercion. Society has also seen OC driving policy by the tragedy that has occurred, not necessarily be based on what the research has shown. It is also important to note that these laws created by knee-jerk responses to change, do not guarantee services will be available. There are currently communities that lack needed services. We should be helping fix areas of the legal system to help fill this void rather than keep creating a policy that may or may not work."
1585," When it comes to being involuntarily committed, it is essential to understand the differences between civil and criminal commitment. Both of which play a massive role in inpatient and outpatient involuntary commitment. Involuntary commitment can be described as the blend of retribution, deterrence, and  parens patriae.  This form of interaction between criminal and civil law helps us grasp inpatient and outpatient involuntary commitment. For instance, we have criminal commitment where the state uses its power to protect its citizens from harm by using methods like retribution and deterrence on individuals who pose a threat as well as using civil commitment methods like  parens patriae  that focuses more on the specific individual and less around society's needs.   Parens Patriae  is best explained as the state's paternalistic duty to assist those who are unable to care for themselves (Slate et al., 2013). This week we reviewed literature and videos surrounding the pros and cons of inpatient and outpatient involuntary commitment, both of which are flawed. Despite their flaws, today, the U.S. uses each of these methods to help address issues surrounding PWMI.     Inpatient involuntary commitment can be seen as benefiting the individual who suffers from mental illness. There are four social goals when it comes to inpatient civil commitment. The first is the role the state plays in providing care and treatment for those who require it. By hospitalizing PWMI, they are supposed to be provided with care and treatment through hospitalization. Having this 24-hour supervision on the PWMI and removing them from society can help deter them from harming themselves or others and allowing PWMI to be cared for without interference of the outside world (Slate et al., 2013). Being cared for by other than a family member releases society from having to provide constant care for the PWMI needs. Lastly, by involuntary committing an inpatient society is protecting the PWMI as well as society by removing them off the streets. One major con of inpatient civil commitment is that it is coercive. By definition, It is the removal of an individual again"
1586,"Liisa,  Similar to your discussion post, I discussed how a major con to me, despite both of the commitment styles, being coerced is not ideal. You explained how they use coercion for compliance. Coercion is seen in inpatient treatment when individuals are taken and hospitalized against their free will. As well as with outpatient treatment because if they are not abiding by their terms and conditions, they will either be picked up by law enforcement or sent to an inpatient hospital. You discussed appropriate measures of success would be a reduction in backslides and maintaining outpatient care voluntarily. When I heard a voluntary basis, I then think about how we would be able to help PWMI, who have yet to accept their diagnosis. Slate et al. (2013) explain how the people who are subject to these actions (involuntary commitment) need to believe that they have been treated fairly and with concern for their well-being. I think an effective way to determine the success of commitment is not only the reduction of hospitalizations but also the satisfaction with treatment and their quality of life. Do you think if we switched involuntary commitment to voluntary commitment, we would have more success? In some cases, I believe we would, but we also learned the difficulty of trying to help people who do not think they need help. I think it is also essential to have a common goal among society for PWMI to help fill this void."
1587,"Briana,   It was easy to follow your discussion post when it came to looking at the pros and cons of civil commitment. I also discussed the differences between inpatient and outpatient commitment and the way they civilly commit people. On one spectrum, we have inpatient commitment based on the fact they want to help individuals by removing them from society as well as protect the community. Whereas outpatient commitment lets PWMI live their day to day lives when they abide by their conditions. You discussed how a con for involuntary inpatient commitment is that it is discriminatory to blacks since they are more likely to be hospitalized and treated with coercion. This is true; however, when we read Swanson et al. (2009), they found some discrimination when it came to outpatient commitment. Swanson et al. (2009) found there to be no racial bias; however, it disproportionality in the application of outpatient commitment among the black population. Nevertheless, it is important to note within the article, and the authors addressed how these can reflect both a health disparity between whites and blacks and a gap in where people get care. Do you think if we look more into the disparity of care among races would help address these discriminatory issues? Or do you think it is more around educating the public on mental illness to help remove the stigma? I believe it is the best of both, by educating the public and looking at disparities among the care they receive will help address these issues. "
1588,"I am familiar with using Powerpoint, however, I am not familiar with using Zoom as a recording."
1589," Stigma and the Crisis Intervention Team work hand in hand when dealing with PWMI. Law enforcement stigma plays a huge role in the interaction and attitudes toward PWMI. Discussed within the video,  Police officers take crisis intervention training to help people with mental illness , an advocate described how law enforcement is generally taught to go into a situation and gain control of the individuals acting out. However, when it comes to dealing with people with a mental illness, they cannot do that. The stigma around PWMI is disconnected to the reality that we cannot solely blame officers who shoot PWMI when they did not receive training to de-escalate the situation. Society needs to address these stigmas. CIT uses law enforcement’s stigma, and diminishes them by learning to slow down the situation, communicate with the person with mental illness and come to a resolution. Informing law enforcement, especially skeptics about the effects of empathy on a PWMI, can help with the de-escalation of these situations. CIT has also been found to refuse law enforcement officers stigmatizing attitudes toward mental illness. We see this example of the officer who answered a call about someone who was suicidal. In the video, we saw the individual sitting on his porch, not hand-cuffed, willing to communicate about what was going on. Having the officer be there as an empathetic ear is all he needed, it helped because the officer was willing to listen to the needs of the individual. I do not believe this would have been possible without CIT training in place because the officer’s stigma around PWMI may have taken over."
1590," In my opinion, I do not think it is “fair” that police are often the first responders to situations involving PWMI. We learned during this week’s lecture that police see the arrest as a more expedited option than referral to the mental health system. The referral is where we see PWMI being funneled through incorrect outlets of the criminal justice system. Instead of giving PWMI the resources they need, mental health resources, they are being criminalized. Law enforcement is not the sole person to blame; we need to have easier access to mental health resources. I would like to see the state having an interdisciplinary team involving mental health providers and law enforcement. For example, if there were a call to law enforcement about a PWMI, there would be a specific person who would meet at the location of the request and help address the situation adequately. This does not mean law enforcement is exempt from de-escalation training, but they would be there to ensure the safety of others. Today, we see police training not being extensive. Since they do not provide specialized training for officers to deal with and process mental health processes, I believe having a professional who solely deals with PWMI can help. "
1591," When it comes to the challenges PWMI has to face, I believe each stage of the criminal process described in the video would be difficult to navigate. Since I have to choose the most difficult, I would think either the prosecution & pretrial services, as well as corrections. I felt as if the prosecution and pretrial services would be challenging to navigate because, during the appearances and hearings of this segment of the process, the judge’s stigma around PWMI can play a huge role. We have learned from previous weeks PWMI were denied bail at higher rates than their counterparts who did not have a mental illness. We can see PWMI falling to the hands of the court based on their stigma around their illness. Another stage of the process, I see most difficult for PWMI to navigate is the corrections stage. Inmates who do not have a mental illness are released once their sentence is completed. However, last week, we found PWMI would serve their time and then be transferred to another facility to help their diagnosis. They are serving a form of a second sentence they need to complete. Not only do PWMI have to serve longer sentences, but they also do not get proper care for their diagnosis when they are incarcerated. They are either put into solitary confinement or wholly ignored. PWMI lacks the appropriate care they need while they are incarcerated.  "
1592," One benefit that arose for PWMI around the recent changes in California corrections shift for felons from prisons to local jurisdictions can be the release of PWMI, who are committed for petty misdemeanors. The specifics of who is being committed to the criminal justice system can help with the deterrence of funneling of PWMI through the criminal justice system. However, many challenges still arise. Such as the lack of resources they are receiving as well as PWMI, who are incarcerated, are going to face more of a disadvantage than their counterparts. We saw in the video,  Cutting CA Prison Sizes Lead To More Problems, the  state can barely afford to pay its staff. When there is a lack of funding, resources that are generally cut first, deal with PWMI. We also saw in the video the way jails handle PWMI. When they have an individual who has a mental illness, they have a different type of room than other inmates. They receive a padded cell with a small padded mat on the floor, and that was it. Showcasing first hand what PWMI has to deal with while incarcerated. This shift of changes in California may be cutting prison size, but it is also cutting proper resources for PWMI. "
1593," If individuals are unaware of how to properly deal with a person who has a mental illness, their stigma around the specific demographic may take over. Within the lecture and videos we watched this week, we learned interactions are defined by the first couple of seconds of the encounter. Law enforcement must slow time down, communicate, and come to a resolution when dealing with PWMI since time becomes the enemy. Officers must do this when going into a mental health crisis since half of the people shot by the police are mentally ill, which raises a few questions. Is it because of people with a mental illness or more violent than their counterparts who do not have a mental illness? In previous weeks we learned this is not true. So why are PWMI being shot and/or imprisoned at higher rates? To try and help lower these rates, law enforcement agencies have been looking at promising alternative strategies that can focus on aspects of prevention (Lofstrom et al., 2016). For instance, law enforcement agencies have been taking crisis intervention training to help prevent funneling PWMI through the criminal justice system. Crisis intervention training (CIT) is a specialized response to persons in mental health crises. Generally, CIT training is a 40-hour specialized training that includes officer interactions with consumers of mental health services (Slate et al., 2013).     The CIT model is applied to each law enforcement agency differently; however, when discussing the Taheri (2013) article, their meta-analysis is revolved around the original Memphis model. When talking about the effectiveness of CIT, it is essential to understand the goals of the model. CIT is mainly rehabilitation based. Using police officers as a direct person to help aid PWMI to treatment programs instead of arrests, as well as helping reduce the stigmatization of mental illness. Not only are PWMI the focus of this form of initiative, but also the safety of the officer is still one of the main priorities of CIT. Due to mental illness producing different types of encounters, the uncertainty that a situation can become violent can lead to a mishandled response. Common mishandled reactions from this week’s lecture were police using force that injured either themselves or the PWMI. This was showcased in the video from lecture 4-4 of the woman’s boyfriend, who had schizophrenia that was shot consequently without"
1594,"Caroline,  Similar to what you wrote, I discussed how crisis intervention training is the foundation, and we can expand on that in different ways. Since CIT models were created to reduce arrest as well as still keep officer safety in mind, I liked your suggestion of a call-for-service. However, I do have a few questions around what that entails. Are the dispatchers the ones coding the services needed for the PWMI, or is the officer? If the dispatcher is trying to code the call for the officers to refer, wouldn’t that be a little more difficult than if the officer went out to the scene and then evaluated the situation? I can see the appeal to this form of new training based on the fact CIT-trained officers are more prone to transport persons for treatment than they had been before CIT training (Slate et al., 2013). This Call-for-service can help pinpoint which service they need, but I think officers should be the ones trained on the specific service. The code, in my opinion, can be used to help data be analyzed if someone wanted to compare the CIT development and evaluations you discussed. Also, when it comes to training all the same throughout the nation, wouldn’t there be some gap? Meaning, not all cities are the same, so if a town has a lot of people who have schizophrenia, do you think emphasizing a little more on the diagnosis would help that specific law enforcement agency? Overall great post!"
1595,"Wendy,   I was shocked at the fact Taheri (2016) was unable to conclude when it came to the injury of PWMI or Officers. Taheri (2016) did find some vital analysis within their study. I noticed how consistent studies showcased arrests being reduced and PWMI using mental health resources as a win for CIT agencies. You discussed how you have concerns about widespread implementation; I do as well. However, using CIT as a foundation and then having to try to form it to the specific city, in my opinion, would be sufficient for me. Do you think if we had a CIT team, similar to ones discussed in Chapter 6 of Slate et al. (2013) that specialize in mental health, went to significant cities law enforcement agencies and molded their department to a specific CIT model would help? Having a specialized group go to major cities to help create a CIT program specifically for them can be a way to help bridge the gap between the inconclusive findings within Taheri’s conclusions. This would be a trial run for the widespread CIT implementation in every city around the U.S. Also, and you discussed if there were little CIT officers; this can affect the overall effectiveness of CIT, so would you recommend starting immediately all new sworn-in officers need to be trained? Or what type of way would you go about this? Great post!"
1596," Despite medication costs consuming a large percentage of jail budgets, I think this is the most common form because it is the easiest and least time-consuming. For instance, if inmates were transported to inpatient mental health services, jails would need to have that available. If they did not have inpatient treatment, which most jails do not, they are then transferred to outside hospitals and highly more expensive. When I say prescribing medication is easiest to do is because most psychiatrists go off of what the PWMI was previously on.  In the video, Telepsychiatry, we saw how the physiatrist was not even in the room. He asked what medication the patient was already on and then proceeded to say he will get to the way he used to be. Jails are only looking for short term treatment for PWMI, in my opinion, because it helps with their current situation. They are trying to manage the PWMI while they are in jail so they can be compliant. Medication during their sentence is just a band-aid for a broken bone, in my opinion. Jails need to start putting the PWMI into consideration. If we were to deal with their diagnosis adequately, we would be able to prevent them from recidivating. "
1597," I knew jail inmates had limited rights while in jail, but I feel as if they are more limited once they are released. They are unable to vote, bare arms, still have to be monitored while in the community, all of which I understand have a reason. I do think jail inmates are given a decent amount of rights. I did not know they were given the right to free speech. The video,  What Rights Do They Have  adequately showcased the rights inmates have. However, it is essential to note they did not have these rights immediately. For instance, freedom of religion was not always a right granted. Some believed certain practices were not “dangerous,” but, through the legal system, this was resolved. The right to refuse treatment is a beneficial right to have for PWMI. However, I can see how this right can be taken advantage of. Due to this, there is no adversarial hearing before a judge not being required to force treatment against their will. Since there is a lack of training for guards around PWMI, I can see the force of medication being taken advantage of. The inmate with PWMI should be mandated a form of a medical advocate to help speak on their behalf. Furthermore, I would want to see inmates who are released from jail have a few more rights., such as voting. I do not believe someone’s criminal record should affect their right to vote. "
1598," Three indicators I feel jails should measure about mental illness is (1) rates of mortality/suicide for PWMI (2) the cost to house a PWMI compared to in a mental health facility and (3) return to jail for PWMI. I think measuring the rates of mortality/suicide of PWMI can help with the safety of the PWMI. Making arrangements to ensure they do not kill themselves as well as understand why they feel as if suicide is the answer. Additionally, when it comes to mortality rate, we can compare if the inmates without mental illness have similar or different mortality rates. The cost of housing can be used to measure the quality of care taken for PWMI. Are they being housed in jails for public safety or because it is cheaper than admitting them in a mental health facility? Lastly, understanding the recidivism rate for PWMI can help with the basis of comparison when it comes to their crime. For example, are they in jail because they are more violent or because they have lack of resources around them? All of these indicators, I believe, can impact PWMI in prisons."
1599," When I watched  Jails are the New Insane Asylums, I  was shocked at the fact that there were (1) over 28000 people who have mental illness in their jail as well as (2) most of them have been housed from 50 to 400 times. Being arrested and jailed for PWMI cannot be secure. It cannot be easy for anyone, despite their diagnosis, to be detained and jail. To also learn that most of the people in jail have not been sentenced but are awaiting trial is ridiculous. We learned that PWMI is housed in jail, pending trial at higher rates than their counterparts because judges know their illness. Similar to what is said within the video about shooting involving PWMI are preventable tragedies, this can also be applied to the incarceration of PWMI. Instead of putting them through the horrific process, they should be admitted to a mental health facility while awaiting trial. By doing this, the PWMI can show the judge they are getting help for their diagnosis. Since most of PWMI are being housed for low crimes, I think this is the best alternative because jails are spending thousands of dollars housing PWMI. Lastly, since there is limited room in jails, PWMI is not getting the proper care they need. They are being shoved in a room with people who committed harsher crimes, resulting in a more chaotic atmosphere for the PWMI. Having to go through this cycle hundreds of times is ridiculous, PWMI needs to be accommodated to help address their diagnosis. "
1600,"When looking at the appropriateness of jail use for the severely mentally ill, it is essential to look at factors that may influence the funding, architectural, and operational constraints. For instance, the rates of MI in jails can play a massive role in the actual amount of money allocated to jails for PWMI. Self-reports from inmates are the most effective when trying to get an accurate rate of inmates who suffer from a severe mental illness (16%) compared to structured diagnostic interviews (6.4%). Based on previous lectures, we learned that PWMI, who are not comfortable with there diagnosis tend to deny their diagnosis; this can also apply to inmates. Despite the rates of MI in jails being inconsistent, jails are not the processing place for PWMI. Slate et al. (2016) explain how jails are now the second connect when the justice system PWMI encounter. Their first contact is with law enforcement, which generally arrests them and processes them through the system. Jails have been used to provide care for the individual detained if they appear to be coming down from their substance use. PWMI have been found to experience all aspects of their symptoms at once when coming down from their substance abuse. Experiencing their full intensity within the jails, especially from substance abuse, can also make individuals’ behaviors unpredictable, it also exacerbates an individual’s symptoms of mental illness. Jails are ill-equipped to deal with these reactions because of their limited staff and limited city or county funding (Slate et al. 2016). Furthermore, when compared to prisons, jails are notoriously underfunded and understaffed. Prisons are more stable and less chaotic since their funded by state correctional budgets that have financial backing. The use of jails for the severely mentally ill is inappropriate for several reasons. The population of the incarcerated mentally ill exceeds the inpatient hospital population (316,000 inmates vs. 60,0000 patients) (Raphel & Stoll, 2013). The architecture of jails is overcrowded since they initially used for housing inmates for less than a year. A policy like a realignment has greatly affected jails, which in turn dramatically impacted PWMI — shifting the responsibility of lower-level offenders from state to county in 2011. Realignment affected three significant populations: lower-level felons are now handled at the local level, lower-level releases are now supervised by county, and most parole violators"
1601," Wendy,  Jail experience is unfavorable for anyone; however, as you said within your post, PWMI experience far worse consequences than their counterparts. We have learned from this week’s readings, PWMI can be at risk for abuse, relapse, and suicide (Torrey et al., 2010). I think it is ironic how realignment in California came about as a result of poor health conditions for prisoners and a need to reduce the prison population. However, when realignment came into effect, it did more harm than good for PWMI. The issue of overpopulation within prisons was shifted into jails. Jails which house most PWMI since most of them are there for petty crimes and misdemeanors. Additionally, when it comes to overcrowding in jails, persons with mental illness need their own space, as you mentioned. We saw PWMI being set to solitary, which can affect their psychological well-being even more. I am wondering what you suggest for possible solutions to the issue? Do you believe we should have proper care for PWMI in jails, or do you think we should solely send them to a mental health facility? Let's allow PWMI to help deal with their diagnosis and offer treatment and if they refuse to send them to jail with proper staff to take care of them. Great job!"
1602," Amber,  We both discussed the inappropriateness of the use of jails for persons with severe mental illness. You specifically highlighted the text of McNiel, Binder & Robinson (2005) that found inmates who had co-occurring severe mental illness and substance-related disorders were housed for a more extended time than their counterparts. For instance, mentally ill inmates on Rikers Island were housed on average 215 days compared to 42-day average stay for inmates (Slate et al., 2016). Jail is a hostile environment for anyone, but PWMI has other demons to deal with than just the average inmate. Such as symptoms of post-traumatic stress syndrome that can reoccur from victimization within jails. As well as being sensitive to everyday things such as the lights on can affect the overall well-being of the person with mental illness. Furthermore, within your discussion post, you discuss the benefits of prop 47 and 57. Claiming they allow state savings to spending their funds toward vulnerable populations, such as the mentally ill. However, when we watched the video last week,  Cutting CA Prison Sizes Lead to More Problems , we saw the effects of these propositions on jails. For instance, when the guard showed us their mental health cell, all it was a mat on a floor with padded walls. If you were to alter the propositions, how would you assist PWMI? Not only by helping to clear up individual prior records, but would you assist the living conditions for PWMI in jails? And if so, how would this look like? Possibly having a separate wing for PWMI and staff to help them? These are all ideas that come to mind when thinking about how to enhance each proposition. Overall great post!"
1603," I do not think it is “fair” to use risk assessment tools when discussing probation and parole. We have learned risk assessments are not 100% accurate, one of the major things I think about when looking at risk assessments is they do not leave room for growth. For instance, the pretrial services report determines the likelihood of an offender appearing in court. The video,  knowledge seminar - the art and science of pretrial and probation supervision  discussed a man named Sam. Sam had a pretrial services report filed that questioned the likelihood he would appear in court and the potential risk danger he poses to the community. Common questions like “likely to appear in court or not likely” and “danger to the community and not a danger.” Based on the history, the judge decides whether or not he should release him. As well as after the individual chooses to stand trial, the probation officer needs to provide a pre-sentencing report. The pre-sentencing report discusses the criminal history, impact of his crimes, restitution, rehabilitation, and sentencing guidelines for the individual. I feel as if I did not know the comprehension of the pre-sentencing instructions because, generally, when we discuss risk assessment, it is usually all the negatives. However, I do not think it is 100% fair to rely heavily on these risk assessments, but one of the judges said it is extensive, and they rely on the expertise of the researchers who created the model that they know what they are doing. Overall I do not think it is fair due to the lack of consideration of the growth of an individual, but I do think it is good enough right now until something else comes forward to address the flaws in the model. "
1604," The RNR focuses on higher-risk offenders, on offender criminogenic needs and provides services/treatment that is consistent with the learning style of the offender. I believe mental health professionals would be receptive to the RNR approach for PWMI in the justice system. The reason being is mental health professionals would be helping rehabilitate the offender and take into consideration their cognitive ability by using cognitive behavioral techniques. By moving away from recidivism, treatment, and recidivism (the old model), it does not address the specific PWMI. We have learned that research has shown the vast majority of PWMI is not violent, dangerous, or even criminal, so using a model like RNR would take individual factors of the individual and apply these findings. Since PWMI has more risk factors than their counterparts who do not suffer from a mental illness, the courts should be looking at other factors besides recidivism while PWMI is under supervision in the community. Such as whether they are getting treatment for their illness or if they have a substance abuse disorder and getting help for that condition. As well as looking at the type of living arrangement the PWMI has. PWMI are more likely to be homeless than their counterparts. By giving them support in areas, they are at higher risk while under supervision within the community can ultimately reduce their recidivism rates. "
1605," Matt Jenkins is the chief of probation in San Diego. He believes probation is the most appropriate section for the most law-breaking sanctions we see. There are approximately 400,000 people in his county on probation. I think it is important to note that most of the violent offenders who need to be removed from the community are relatively low. Within the video, Jenkins highlighted how probation officers have a caseload of clients. Each of the clients has a specialized care plan for the individual on their workload. Once the case plan is created, the probation officer connects them with the services they need. By having the role of the probation officer as a liaison between social services for PWMI can help reduce recidivism rates. They also hold PWMI accountable when it comes to using these services. Compared to jail, PWMI is better off on probation (depending on their crime and dangerousness to the community). Prison does not change the behavior of the individual, so I do believe punishment is set up to address the supervision treatment of PWMI. When PWMI is sentenced to prison, their illness is not treated and/or it is rarely discussed.  Furthermore, probation is more cost-effective than probation. To supervise an individual on probation, it is roughly $1,500 statewide. Compared to being housed in prison is just under $50,000 a year. We should be using the money saved from imprisoning these individuals and help get them the services they need. "
1606," Within the video,  For mentally ill defendants, a different kind of court,  the news anchor highlights how about a quarter of the inmates within the prisons of Massachusetts has a mental illness. I prefer to be a participant in a mental health court then a traditional court processing. Like many of the specific courts we see today: substance abuse, domestic violence, veterans, homeless, and juveniles, the specificity of the court appeals to me. If I were a PWMI, I would want the proceedings to fit me. For instance, one advantage of mental health courts is the ability to oversee the therapeutic progress of persons with MI before their return to the community. By having the judge review my therapeutic progress, it can help with their specific needs. By getting the vulnerable individual, the treatment they can help reduce the overall recidivism rate of PWMI. Probation officer, Gregory Clifford, within the video, explained how the mandated treatment through the MH courts had been found within the past two years, none of the individuals came back with new charges. This can be due to several factors; however, having someone support them at every facet of their lives plays a huge role.   Despite the criticism of the process being stigmatizing, the traditional court processing for PWMI is still stigmatizing. While in an MH court, the judge emphasis their mental illness but applies it in ways that can help the individual. Instead of judges who may not get to take the offenders MI into consideration as slowly and relies on the severity of the crime."
1607," Supervision of people who have mental illness who are on probation can become very tricky. Due to the rise of attention of issues PWMI comes in contact with the criminal justice system, there has been a rise in responses to alternatives to incarceration. Such as pretrial or post-disposition, jail-based diversion, mental health courts, and specialty probation supervision (Skeem et al., 2015). The risk-need-responsivity model (RNR) has become a widely accepted model that focuses on providing mental health services under court supervision. Unlike the old-style model of mental illness in the criminal justice system where it focuses on mental health treatment, helping reducing recidivism. With the growth of RNR came the deemphasis of evidence-based mental health practices for PWMI. RNR focuses on treatment for the PWMI takes into consideration the individual factors of the person with MI that can affect their treatment. Furthermore, there are general risk factors for PWMI that engage in criminal behavior. A common risk factor among PWMI is antisocial traits. When trying to affect recidivism rates, we should be treating these traits to reduce them.   Skeem et al. (2015) concluded that the field should avoid rushing to a “new” evidence base too rapidly because it is not as dependable. For instance, when applying RNR to PWMI, there must be a form of recognition of the unique characteristics of the individual. For example, the effects of the individual’s mental illness and criminal justice system involvement need to be looked at carefully. With this in mind, the Chief Probation Officer (CPO) needs to understand when applying the RNR model, PWMI cannot only be generalized to the model like any offender. PWMI may not be affected in the way the model intends them to be. Even when it comes to individuals within a unique population, their traits vary drastically. Peterson et al. (2014) found the degree to which mental health symptoms influence criminal behavior varies across crimes with individual offenders. Applying this finding, CPO can create a way to address the issues of specific individuals. The CPO should first test whether the generalizability of the application of the model can be applied to PWMI in their area. Mental illness is not generalizable, despite many people affected by MI. The probation office could start to look up common MI in their community and try to address those il"
1608," Wendy,  While I was reading your discussion post, all I was thinking about is how Skeem et al. (2015) addressed how the PWMI were shown to have lower recidivism rates when using methods like cognitive behavioral therapy programs and support from probation officers. Still, it did not lower the rates of violence within the community. I began to think, did the rates of violence in the community about the entire population, or was it talking about rates of violence within the community among PWMI? I believe the reduction of recidivism rates is a substantial advantage when it comes to helping PWMI. I liked how you stated how mentally ill are vulnerable, and the justice system needs to serve and protect them. Similar to programs like the CBT program, giving PWMI the tools to become members of society can affect overall public safety. Do you think if we focus on using these therapeutic based methods can eventually help improve public safety? In my head, I guess if recidivism rates are low, then eventually the public safety will improve, kind of like the domino effect. Lastly, the suggestion of combining RNR and CBT is ideal. You are correct when you say, why can we not have both? I have said this countless times within this course, but is the goal to rehabilitate PWMI or to keep the public safe? If individuals believe PWMI are all violent, we cannot move forward to helping their unique needs. Great post!  Bobbie"
1609," Cornise,  I also addressed the importance of probation officers in the community supervision of PWMI. PWMI has unique traits that need to be addressed by treatment. We learned this week within the articles and lectures the critical role support plays. When looking at probation officers, would you suggest PWMI go through the route or traditional probation or probation specifically for their mental illness? Skeem et al., (2017) found having probation officers with smaller caseloads as well as having specific training in mental health played a role in helping the PWMI. Generally, probation officers for PWMI are the ones with those characteristics. To continue, you discussed how these programs should be for both low and high-risk offenders, which I believe is right; do you think this form of training and specialization should be for each sector of the justice system? For instance, criminal court proceedings? The goal should be to change the behavior of individuals who go through the criminal justice system, and we have learned this week’s incarceration does not do that. So for this unique population, how would you apply these findings? Helping address the unique population by sending them to a mental health court,, or should we send them to traditional court proceedings? Specialized probation or traditional? Great post!  Bobbie"
1610," If the state were to use my tax dollars on treating mentally ill in prison adequately, I would be fine for several reasons. One of the main reasons is because it can help with the suicide rate of PWMI in prisons. After learning about the negative consequence PWMI face within prisons, we have found they commit suicide at higher rates than their counterparts. Also, when we are using our dollars towards evidence-based treatment, the reintegration into the community can be that much easier. We will be giving PWMI the tools they need to succeed. PWMI has been found to continue to come in contact with the criminal justice system, and we need to start addressing the issue head-on. Using the money that is already allocated to the justice system and using evidence-based treatment can help minimize the issues. Also, if they were to raise taxes to help PWMI, I would be okay with that, as well. If we are trying to bridge the gap between recidivism and the way PWMI is treated within the community, then use my tax dollars. I want to ensure it is being used for PWMI and not for something that is supposed to help them but does not. This is why I continue to emphasize the evidence-based treatment discussed within the video,  Cost to Treat Mental Illness in Prison Rising . "
1611," I think the disadvantages to inmates outweigh the advantages of solitary confinement for inmates. When I watched the video,  What Does Five Years in Solitary Confinement do to a person , it was interesting to see the point of the inmate. He explained the steps in which his psychological well-being began to deteriorate. It is a massive disadvantage to the inmate’s mental and social welfare when they are in solitary. They are only taken out of their cell for about one hour a day and are generally alone when they are released. After ten days, they become violent and aggravated. When inmates become aggravated, the guards can believe they are doing the right thing by separating them from other inmates; however, solitary confinement is one of the main reasons why they have become violent. When you have minimal contact with others, the brain begins to play tricks on you. Such as becoming sensitive to sounds around you.  Furthermore, once you are sent to the public sector of prisons, it becomes difficult to have interactions with others, which was described within the video, when he became dissociated among the other inmates. Lastly, the only advantage I see of solitary confinement is separating the worst of the worst from the general population. However, that is not always the case when it comes to the type of inmate who is in solitary. Some are sentenced to confinement when they act out towards a guard or have a mental illness. This is why we find PWMI in solitary because the guards do not know how to respond to their diagnosis. All in all, I think there are more disadvantages to the inmate than the advantages of solitary confinement. "
1612," PWMI is disproportionately shown within the criminal justice system. There are low funds when it comes to resources for PWMI. I do think it is possible to rehabilitate prisoners with a mental illness. Within the video,  Mental illness in Prisons , they discussed how they are screened that look for indicators and referring them on for help. We learned they have an option to get help since this is one of the only places some individuals get services; however, I do believe if they are flagged, they should have some form of treatment in place. If they do not want to go to the mental health wing, they should have a psychologist come and visit to discuss their options periodically. There is a stigma around PWMI, and we cannot dismiss them just because they said no the first time. I believe with time, PWMI would get better at handling their diagnosis. Rehabilitating them back into society should be the primary goal, like any other inmate. We have also learned being in prison can lead to mental illness, which is why I believe we should be focusing on not just PWMI who are found to initially have a mental illness but everyone who comes into contact with the prison system. We can then try to rehabilitate each inmate from the consequences of incarceration to ensure they do not recidivate. "
1613," The prison environment is one unlike any other. It is overcrowded, loud has bright lights, and overall, the entire vibe of the area is negative. When it comes to PWMI, they can be aggravated by the conditions and the environment. If inmates do not know the individual is suffering from a mental illness and choose to pick a fight with them, the PWMI can become violent (like anyone else). They can become defensive to everyone since they can feel like everyone is a threat to them. As well as, be a victim to solitary confinement. When inmates with an MI become defiant to guards or act out towards other inmates, they can be seen as a threat. Nowadays, it does not take much to get thrown into solitary. Like others, PWMI can become sensitive to sounds, have a difficult time interacting with others, and act out violently. When it comes to the negative consequences of incarceration, PWMI may have a harder time rehabilitating back into society. For instance, within the video, Stanley said it made him uncomfortable when a car passed by, and he does not suffer from a mental illness. The environment of prisons made something as simple as a passing car difficult for him to embrace. When it comes to PWMI, this can become too difficult, which may be why we see PWMI recidivate at a high rate."
1614,"As a result of new policies and movements like realignment and the deinstitutionalization movement, we have seen a shift of people with mental illness move away from mental health facilities and placed within jails and prisons. PWMI, who were funneled within the justice system, were found without proper support services. To help address the challenges staff and inmates may face within the justice system process, we should start at creating instruments that are more developed than the ones we previously used. Currently, the assessment part of intake labels PWMI as extreme due to their MI. Creating a multidimensional instrument can help classify people with a mental illness more adequately (Adams & Ferrandino, 2008). By creating a multifaceted tool, it can help with appropriately telling staff members the nature of the specific inmate’s problem. For example, when we have someone who may appear to be an extreme inmate, but he has schizophrenia, he would be sent to the mental health sector of the prison instead of solitary. We learned this week the determinantal repercussion of solitary, especially for PWMI, since they are dealing with their diagnosis as well as the psychological trauma of solitary. Isolation has been found to bring an increased risk of self-injury for PWMI. Having proper resources for the staff and inmate with an MI can help with the reduction of suicides and the use of solitary cells, all of which are beneficial for PWMI. One of the main ways prisons can best meet the needs of the inmates, and staff safe is enhancing the role of correction officers. When corrections officers have some form of mental health training, it has been found to bring considerable rewards for the entire prison population (Adams & Ferrandino, 2008). There has been mixed research on the amount of mental-health training correctional officers should receive; however, I believe the correctional officer should be a branch toward the mental health facilities. Instead of being looked at as stern, they need to be a person who is there with resources. Correctional officers are the ones who are in constant interaction with the inmates, so they need to be the ones who are appropriately trained. When it comes to containing costs to help provide the treatment need for PWMI, it would be little to none. Allocating training time and preparation can be put into the designated time of correctional training officers as they would. For instance, some state s have been"
1615," Amber,   Great post! I am curious about the second paragraph of your discussion post. Specifically, when you mention the Wilper, Woolhandler, Boyd, Lasser, McCormick, Bor & Himmelsetin’s (2009) article. You discussed how the number of inmates was found to be taking medication for their illness at the time of their arrests would be useful information. Is this because the staff would be able to continue the use of their drug or to have a specific treatment for inmates? When it comes to their erratic behavior, would you suggest this is due to them not being on their medication? Slate et al. (2013) discussed the costs of medicines for inmates with an MI. Do you believe from the readings, This is an excellent way to allocate money toward the health care system, or should we use them in other areas such as community-based interventions? Costs seem to be one of the main driving factors of the types of treatment PWMI should receive, with this in mind I think the best way to use the money is toward a preventative measure toward recidivism."
1616," Caroline,  You discuss how there should be an assessment before entering prison that should decrease the amount of unsafety for inmates and staff. However, I do believe there is already an assessment when intaking prisons. Adams & Ferrandino (2008) discussed how the instruments currently used are used to classify the types of high-risk offenders to help avoid the issues you discussed. It has been found for PWMI it would lead them to often being labeled as extreme in the categorical type of assessment. PWMI was found to be at risk when it came to this categorical form of evaluation. What kind of assessment would you use in response to the challenges of the current assessment used?  Furthermore, in response to providing treatment to PWMI solely in mental health hospitals, it has been found the vast majority of citizens are still favoring punitive measures over treatment (Slate et al., 2008). With this in mind, how do you think they would respond to these suggestions? I believe therapy within prisons would be the best recommendations because the general public would see they are still serving their sentences as well as getting treatment. We would like to hold the public would take into consideration the benefits of treatment, however; I do not think we are currently there yet in society, "
1617," Based on the video, I find it fascinating that there are ways to stimulate the brain for treatment for depression through surgery. However, I do believe this should be used only if community-based treatment, such as counseling, has been found ineffective. For example, the woman in the video never remembered a time in her life where she was ever happy. She tried to commit suicide several times, committed to the hospital, went to therapy, and even took medication, but it never worked. One of the main reasons why I believe surgery for brain stimulation treatment should be used for depression only for extreme cases is because they have no idea why or how it works. The developer of the procedure still has a difficult time trying to articulate why it works for some, but not all when they do the surgery. Also, like any surgery, there are risks, some resulting in significant brain deficiency. I think we should also take into consideration that there should be a long process when evaluating who gets the surgery because all participants have a major depressive disorder, all of which can impede on their decision-making process. For instance, the woman within the video said she did not realize what was happening entirely until she was on the operating table. Overall, the positive effects that can occur from the surgery are what I am looking at. People finally getting out of the dark place they have been their whole lives is something we cannot ignore. However, when looking at candidates, we need to be very particular in who we choose. "
1618," I would like first to address that I never really looked at the safety of the staff as an issue but only the safety of the patients. I now have a better understanding of the harsh working conditions the crew also has to endure. To provide safe treatment for patients, the safety of the team needs to be in top shape. Meaning, if workers are coming into work afraid of what can happen, they are not providing services to the best of their ability. State hospitals can help with the safety of the staff by having guards there that can manage PWMI as well as protect the team adequately. I also think to have staff go to counseling to deal with everyday emotions that come with being in that kind of environment can help with their turn over rate. Furthermore, when it comes to state hospitals, we know that treatment is not the issue, but safety is. Funneling money to address issues such as lack of security, training, and staffing can help with the overall environment of the hospital. "
1619," I would not describe “Not guilty because of insanity” a get out of jail free card for various reasons. One, it is essential to note that this rarely happens, we learned this week it happens within less than 1% of felony charges. There are many precautions in place to make sure that not everyone is getting set free. Once someone is deemed to be not guilty because of insanity, it is essential to understand that they are not only let go. Similar to the beliefs of the general population, I used to think they would be sent back into the community. However, the offender is sent to the state hospital. Not only are they sent to the state hospital, but they are there for a period equal to the maximum sentence of their most serious offense. They are, in a sense, still getting the same punishment as if they were in jail, but they are serving it in a place that can help them get the help they need for their diagnosis. Overall, the answer is no; I do not believe it is a get out of jail free card because they are not sent home once the verdict is made but are sent to a state hospital. "
1620," As a taxpayer in Missouri, I would be pleased to surround the construction of the new Fulton State Hospital. In the video,  Gov Nixon helps break ground on the new Fulton State Hospital; we  saw the buildings resembled a prison and looked very old, whereas the new buildings seemed like a place of rehabilitation. With this atmosphere in mind, we can move toward patients being treated like patients instead of prisoners. We can begin to protect patients’ rights by having them in places that can improve their overall wellbeing. I do understand that not all states can do this because it is difficult to replace old facilities with newer state hospitals because it is politically difficult given economic times. However, I do believe it is essential to highlight the amount of PWMI who are in the criminal justice system when they belong in mental health facilities. There are many positive effects to state hospitals we have learned from the lecture. Such as medication delivery is more efficient, provides a fuller living environment, can give each other a supportive environment that can be therapeutic, and can open the door to constructive change. With the positive effects in mind, we can move toward the rehabilitation of PWMI. "
1621," When it comes to the role of state hospitals and the criminal justice system, it is essential to remember the different roles they play for PWMI. In my opinion, they should work as two separate entities working together toward a common goal instead of a short answer to a long term issue. During the past half-century, we have seen the deinstitutionalization of state hospitals all across the U.S. Emanuel et al. (2015) explained the 95% decline of patients within the state hospital as a response to policy and regulatory shifts that create financial incentives. This is where we see today U.S. jails and prisons becoming the nation’s largest mental health care facility.     State hospitals should be used to help patients with mental illnesses. Many patients who were found to have chronic psychiatric diseases were found to be overcrowding hospital emergency departments, nursing homes, general hospitals, or on the streets (Emanuel et al., 2015). It is crucial to have state hospitals for several reasons. One of the main factors is because they are equipped for caring for disturbed patients when they are dangerous to themselves or others. State hospitals have also been found to treat MI adequately based on the specific diagnosis. For instance, when dealing with a person who has a major depressive disorder, the state hospital knows all the protocols for how to deal with the diagnosis specifically. If the person was sent to a general hospital or prison, those entities might not be well-equipped as a state hospital. However, I do believe it is essential to address that mental health/state hospitals still need many improvements when dealing with someone with an MI. Within the video,  Staff at the State’s Flagship Mental Hospital Flag Concerns Involving Safety ; we saw two employees from the hospital to be physically assaulted by patients. With this in mind, I believe the state needs to address the issues of lack of security, training, and staffing of state hospitals to help PWMI. It is not only about the quality of care they will receive but also the safety of the people imposing the care. It highlighted the treatment they are doing for PWMI is proper within the facility, but safety is an issue. To address the issue of safety, this is where I see the CJS stepping in to help assist state hospitals. </s"
1622," Vivana,  I also discussed how physicians who treat PWMI are at risk due to the lack of institutional security. I mainly explained how PWMI would suffer because they could not focus on treatment due to their surrounding conditions. Within the video,  Staff at the State’s Flagship Mental Hospital Flag Concerns Involving Safety; the  two physicians explained the physical and emotional trauma they have endured when working within the hospital due to the lack of security and training. I wonder if physicians received more training on security measures would be sufficient enough. Do you think the criminal justice system should step in when it comes to precautionary measures? We have learned the treatment given by the state hospitals is right, but how can we continue to provide PWM with what they need if the staff is un at-ease. Furthermore, I like how you addressed PWMI health benefits are suspended once they are incarcerated. With this in mind, do you think the state should create a policy to help address the issue, or should the CJS keep this into consideration when thinking about how to deal with a case of a PWMI? Great post!"
1623," Caroline & Elise,  I decided to respond to Elise’s ss original post and Caroline’s comment because I assume both of our questions revolve around the same thing. Elise, I failed to mention within my discussion post of the architectural structure of the state hospitals; I only mentioned the architectural structure of prisons. However, I do recall from this week’s video of Gov. Nixon, breaking ground for a new mental health facility and just had that new image in mind. I do now remember that the images before were striking; they resembled prisons, and the overall environment did not mirror rehabilitation whatsoever. I like your suggestion of reconstructing state hospitals; I also mentioned this within my discussion post. Specifically how Fisher et al. (2009) said there might be a little resistance to reconstructing current state hospitals due to the costs; however, we should fund community-based treatment still. With this in mind, do you think community-based treatment is as effective as inpatient care within a state hospital? I think if we choose to spend state funds on the reconstruction of hospitals, the pros outweigh the costs. Caroline, I was just curious by what you meant by the inability to fund more important aspects of the mental health and criminal justice system. Do you mean overall intervention and treatment for PWMI? In my opinion, I would think this is an important aspect because it can help reduce the overall recidivism rate of PWMI. The great discussion, you two!"
1624," Before watching the video, I thought one of the biggest challenges mental health workers might have to deal with in the correctional environment is their safety. However, after watching the video, we learned that they feel safest while doing their job in the penitentiary facility. This can be due to all of the safety precautions put into place for them before their arrival, as well as their overall outlook on the situation they are going into. I believe one of the biggest challenges mental health workers might have to deal with is the way correctional staff may be handling the PWMI before their meetings. For instance, the clinicians understand that the inmate with MI is in a vulnerable state during this stage of the CJS and is there to help them rehabilitate. However, correctional staff may not look at the individual in that lens. Which can result in the possible disturbance of rehabilitation in the inmate? Which is why I believe cross-training with correctional agencies/staff would help. It would help the individual in the process know the work clinicians teach them should be continued throughout their stay in jail. It should not just stop once their session is over but remain with the help of correctional staff. We can see the whole crisis process working efficiently if each of the players involved is doing their part."
1625," I think it takes a court order or other legal actions for the department of corrections to change the way PWMI is treated because some may be naive. Believing that since PWMI was always treated one way that it is the best way to manage them. We have learned that this is not still the case with PWMI. PWMI all suffer from different diagnoses, so courts and legal actions must be taken to show corrections the way they need to be trained to deal with the population. For instance, we learned it is crucial to train correction officers on suicide prevention and officer safety. Some may believe stereotypes around PWMI and how they are violent offenders; however, by court ordering training for them, they can learn tactics to help resolve issues when a person with MI is involved. Within the video, “SCDC first correctional officer training class for mentally ill inmates,” one of the officers said, “When dealing with PWMI, there is no cut and dry, yes and no answer for these situations” all of which everyone involved with PWMI need to understand. A court order and other legal actions for departments of corrections are just a small portion of the big picture. However, every bit of progress is what matters. "
1626," Reflecting on the video, I enjoyed watching the CIT trained law enforcement encounter. One question I do have is, did dispatch know the call was for someone who suffered from an MI or was it just that all officers were trained for CIT, and they would both access the situation when they got there. When it came to essential routine law enforcement encounters, I believe the officers go in to try and locate the situation, whether the individual is harmful to themself or others, as well as take precautions while in the room of the PWMI. For example, one officer was trying to grasp how many medications he took while the other one made sure he did not swallow any more pills. The CIT training approach was more around the way the officer spoke to the individual once he accessed the situation. Meaning, he said he can help him either here or in the hospital as well as having someone help him in the rehabilitation process. This was shown with the paramedics and the services provided to the family members. Each of the actors with the video (paramedics, mental health physician, and officers) were highlighting the resources available to him as well as linking them directly to them. One of the main aspects of CIT was they were able to give funds to the family members as well. This can be beneficial to not only the family member but also PWMI because it is a place where the clinician can come and get a better understanding of the situation. Ultimately, the clinician can report back to law enforcement or the MH facility to give the PWMI the treatment they specifically need. This is different than the routine law enforcement encounter because each of these sectors usually works individually and not with one another. "
1627," I do think the described forms of data sharing seem satisfactory for really understanding the link between CJ and MH systems (when it comes to their clients). We have learned from previous weeks there is an overlap of CJ and MH clients and with this form of data sharing, we can start to begin to quantify the number and actual nature of the severity of the overlap. For instance, when it comes to jail detainees, we can see if there were services given to them before incarceration. With this data, the correctional facility can adequately adjust the environment of the inmate to one that fits them. If the inmate was taking medication for their diagnosis or seeing a weekly therapist, we could create a plan to help with their needs. Not only is the data sharing for corrections, but it can help with other sectors of the criminal justice system. Like, law enforcement and their approaches to someone who has an MI. I do, however, understand PWMI believe that giving out their information infringements on their right to privacy because they did not give consent to do so, however, I think we can improve this by asking the PWMI who is getting treatment if they mind if they shared it with the CJS to help them in the future. I believe if the PWMI sees the CJS and MHS try to improve their future, they would be less resistant. This is where we see trust-building between providers and clients, which can lead to faster and more active rehabilitation for the individual. "
1628,"Different factors are essential for training criminal justice actors around mental health that benefit PWMI. One of the main aspects of the training is first to discuss mental health. Mental health has been pushed aside for decades until the Criminal Justice System and psychologists saw a surge of PWMI interacting with the Criminal Justice System. Linking the two together, each of them knew they had to start properly dealing with PWMI to try and reduce the number of PWMI incarcerated as well as reduce their recidivism rate. One of the main ways was to start training criminal justice actors around mental health. For example, several law enforcement agencies adopted the Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) model to address the needs of PWMI effectively. The CIT model benefited PWMI since they were getting linked to the services they needed, and PWMI was diverted from the criminal justice system entirely (Watson & Fulambarker, 2012). The CIT model has been a foundation for many other pieces of training that deal with PWMI. Parker (2006) use similar tactics to benefit PWMI when correctional officers were trained to use less force and battery by bodily waste on inmates who had an MI. All of which help PWMI in different aspects within the criminal justice system. CIT model was created to increase safety when law enforcements encounter someone with an MI and when it is impossible to divert them from the criminal justice system to mental health treatment. One of the main pieces of the CIT model that differs from basic training is the 40 hours of specialized training. The 40 hours of training provided by mental health clinicians, consumer and family advocates, and police trainers (Watson & Fulambarker, 2012). The information provided by the mental health providers focus on the signs and symptoms of mental illness, the types of treatment providers can give PWMI, disorders that co-occur with one another, and de-escalation techniques. All of which are essential for training around mental health because it provides more excellent responsiveness to the way law enforcement agencies interact with PWMI. Similar to the CIT model, Parker (2006) explains how the training program consists of training specific to mental health. The training consists of 10 hours of training, separated by five sessions, all of which each course emphasizes different facets of mental health. The first session discusses the different types of psychiatric disorders and how they can disti"
1629," Elise,  You bring up convincing points within your posts. Explicitly, how you stated how mental health literacy is essential to training. This is why I believe the CIT model is so successful because the training provided is by mental health providers. The CIT model is founded by law enforcement and mental health advocates & clinicians, so the education provided is coming from people who are interacting with PWMI daily (Watson & Fulambarker, 2012). Do you think this is why CIT training is successful because mental health clinicians are the ones who train law enforcement? Or do you think it is solely on the information provided throughout the training? One of the main questions I had around the video as if the dispatcher had the training to identify the call was around MI, or once the officers were on the scene, they assessed and discovered the individual had an MI. We learned this week that dispatchers also evaluate the call and determine based on the information given if the call is around mental health. Lastly, I completely agree with you that education is essential for training since it helps officers de-escalate the situation and try to avoid the CJS entirely. Great post! "
1630," Caroline,  I also discussed how the mental health training discussed within Parker (2009) benefited inmates with a mental illness. I was specifically shocked about how the 10-hour training actually affected the decline of the use of force. You mentioned how you would suggest a 10-week training, basically 50 hours around mental health training. What would you suggest discussing in the extra weeks? Within the article, they discussed similar topics of the CIT model. Do you think at one point, if the training is too long, there becomes some form of burnout? I think there should be a baseline of hours, about 40 hours like the CIT training, which is reassessed every year with updated findings. Also, I like the suggestion of having one specified person at all times on call for persons with mental illness crisis scenes. I think having more than one person can be more beneficial. Similar to the team of CIT officers we learned about two weeks ago which I think is beneficial since it had law enforcement officers and mental health clinicians working together on the scene. This is where we see the actual interaction and resources provided to PWMI through collaborative work. "
1631," Peer mentoring is one of the most valuable ways to help address stigma in mental illness. One of the main things I got out of the video,  Peer Mentoring Menta Health , is the stigma around mental health was one of the main factors that made individuals reluctant to receive help. It was not until the person suffering from their diagnosis said it was having someone to talk to who knew what I was going through, is what made me reach out for help. I think having a peer mentor is having someone who not only knew what they were going through but is there to talk to you whenever and wherever is crucial. When they were going through the sheet together with their peer mentor, they saw their score go up slowly but surely. This is where we see PWMI assisting in their treatment process. By having them support their treatment process can help address stigma. Even if they are not getting better fast, they can see growth, as well as their mentors, are creating tools to help them build bonds with others where they may have been reluctant before. "
1632," I do not understand why we have not created programs like the MH and substance abuse model since they address co-occurring disorders. We have learned that 8.9 million people experience mental health and co-occurring disorders. The typical model we see today is one issue being treated without the other; however, we have learned that it is highly challenging to do this because the other one is not treated. When it comes to changing the way the justice system works, I believe we would be able to divert many people from interacting with the CJS.  Supporting recovery: Integrated Treatment for Co-occurring Disorders  stated the MH and SA model is designed for science and service. The justice system can use this model to help address the diverse needs of PWMI. With the knowledge gained by the model, it can help the justice system with early intervention due to the required screening discussed within the video as well as acknowledging the approach is not a stand-alone. The justice system can see the model as something to work side-by-side with rather than a separate entity. We know the positive effects due to many of the individuals that have gone through it, stating they wish they had this ten years ago. Overall, I think the justice system will not work with individuals with co-occurring disorders instead of processing them through the system. Having a model addresses all their issues explicitly, and not just one gives them the help they need. "
1633," When it comes to implementing evidence-based practices, I think the criminal justice system and the mental health agencies have to go through the same types of hurdles. Each sector existing practices, and when they want to use evidence-based practices, they should introduce it through the current practice. Yes, there is a difference in the current approaches they use to handle PWMI, but when implementing evidence-based practice, they face the same type of issues. Both sectors should promote and support research through the government, academic, and private sectors into the causes and treatment of PWMI. To get a better understanding of the difference between CJS and MH, the MH should be looking at how research can affect the treatment of MH, CJS should be looking at the causes of PWMI through research for a better response to their diagnosis. When working together, the CJS and MH can adequately use the tools they developed from the evidence-based practice to help PWMI avoid the CJS entirely. Such as the Assertive community treatment (ACT) approach for reentry. ACT helps PWMI through 24-hour services of client advocacy and ongoing assessment, MH and drug treatment, employment and housing assistance, and much more. All of these aspects of the ACT help PWMI avoid interacting with the CJS."
1634," One of the main questions I had during the video before I read the reflection question, was what do they do to violent offenders of PWMI. In the video  Diversion First , the main focus is to divert individuals who are nonviolent from incarceration. When they exclude non-violent offenders, I tend to think they no longer think of them has rehabilitable. If the state believes violent offenders should be incarcerated, then there should be better practices in place to help address their needs while in prison. We have seen from previous weeks the harmful effects of the prison architecture and environment on PWMI, so we should be creating an environment to help them thrive. I do think violent PWMI offenders should be treated the same as non-violent due to their diagnosis. Within the mental health assessments described in the video, violent offenders are already left out. I think violent offenders are being overlooked as a lost cause, but with something like Fairfax in place that is willing to help them can assist them in creating a crisis plan as well as getting the wrap-around services they need. Violent offenders need to be included in diversion efforts because they are even more at risk of recidivism. "
1635," The recommendations of the position paper of the American College of Physicians examined the degree of which integration of behavioral care into the primary care system can vary across the board. The degree to which implementation of the recommendations affect the type of involvement, identification, treatments, and outcomes for PWMI in the criminal justice system. Factors such as selective screening, diagnosis, brief therapy, and referral within the system play a role in how primary care should be able to recognize the physical and behavioral perspective of health care (Crowley et al. 2015). The authors found different approaches to be sufficient as well as hurdles to overcome when fully implementing the model. Mainly the weaknesses focused on cost and stigma around mental health. However, integrating behavioral health care into primary care to address behavioral health issues, within their limits, can solve the topics discussed.  With full integration of BH into primary care, there is an effect of involvement and identification of the mentally ill. The integration can positively affect PWMI with the suggested screening, interventions, and referral to treatment of drug and alcohol abuse in the primary care setting. By having this screening can help filter the types of individuals who are between each level. For instance, PWMI, who have co-occurring disorders, can be located within the involvement of the screening process. If the PWMI were to be screened for the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test and Drug Abuse Screening Test, patients with moderate to high-risk alcohol use could be located and addressed by brief interventions. Beforehand, if there was no screening process in place because of the overall primary care system, PWMI may be subjected to slip through the cracks. Furthermore, by integrating the two, physicians would be able to identify PWMI easier than before. Understanding how adults with a chronic mental illness may also have a mental illness (Crowley et al. 2015). By physicians being informed of the common link between physical and behavioral health, PWMI would be able to be identified within the system.  Not only are the involvement and identification of PWMI within the primary system affected, but also the treatment and outcomes of MI within the system. Behavioral health conditions are not always addressed in"
1636," Alyse,  You discussed PWMI, who is currently incarcerated, and how they can benefit from the integration of behavioral and primary care. Precisely how it can help assist offenders from a repeated cycle of recidivism of the health care system, streets, and then prison. However. Do you think the integration of both methods can help divert PWMI entirely from the criminal justice system? I think the screening process described within the Crowley et al. (2015) can sufficiently funnel most of PWMI to the treatment they specifically need. If their needs are directly met for both their physical and behavioral needs, I think the CJS can be avoided. Similar to the Tennessee Cherokee Health System you discussed, the screening of the underlying factors of behavioral problems can work with other treatment staff to provide comprehensive care. I liked how you explained how we could help PWMI, who are currently involved with the criminal justice system, not only ones who may come into contact with the CJS. We can now see how the effects of integration can be embedded in the current system we have. This can help policymakers get a better understanding of ways we can improve our policy and become more aware of ways we can adjust to research. Great post!"
1637,"   Briana,  I also discussed preventative care within my discussion post and how the integration of the two care systems would help with the assistance of PWMI, avoiding the criminal justice system. You discussed how this could allow PWMI to get treatment instead of being sent to prison or jail. As well as possibly making treatment in the CJ better equipped with more resources. Do you think if we provided the prison system and the behavioral health system, we would see positive outcomes like the one we read about in Crowley et al. (2015)? Or do you think the primary care and behavioral health care system works effectively and efficiently with each other because they work hand in hand? Meaning, since both of those sectors deal with the patient’s health, it is easier to integrate compared to the CJS?  Furthermore, I like how you discussed how this could help with PWMI, who is released from prison. By having the integration, it will also assist current community-based mental health treatment by giving them more support by private sectors. Overall great post!"
1638,"This is gut-wrenching. The fact that we even have a single story like that of Timothy Souders is absurd, the fact that Timothy Souder's story was shared in conjunction with similar stories is insane. This is the United States of America, the land of the free and the home of the brave, and  this is how we continue to treat our ""undesirables."" This week you had us complete some readings. Chapter two of the text discussed the unthinkable beginnings of mental health care. Reading about the psych wards over-run with people being held in captivity, tortured, controlled... it reminded me of the Nazi camps, quite frankly. It made me angry to think that main-stream schooling, history classes, do not share this dark history. Rather we push it under the carpet, act like it didn't happen. Yesterday I wondered why this was the case, I felt it was unjust. Today, watching this video I realize we do that because it's still happening, and as such, America simply isn't ready to have a conversation regarding this ""legal"" form of torture. So many things could have prevented Timothy Souders from dying in prison, and it would have started with people simply valuing his life enough to care if he lost it. "
1639,"I can't even imagine how mental illness would have been conceptualized prior to us having knowledge about even physical aliments and how to tend to them. Throughout time, people have sought to address mental illness to the best of their abilities with the tools available to them at that time. It makes sense to me that in civilizations based heavily on religious and spiritual modalities for rationalizing the world around them, an intangible disease (mental illness), would be categorized as evil, also spiritual in nature. Trying to rid the body of this took many forms, and evolved as our understanding of the physical world and  medicine expanded. The greatest leap forward in treatment of mental health occurred during the time of the civil war, championed by Dorthea Dix, who started a conversation that mental illness should not be punished, but treated (those with mental illness are not ""bad"" or ""wrong"").  Sadly mental illness, even today, is still not fully understood. Funding for treatment of those affected by mental illness continues to be lacking, and as discussed in just the previous lecture, our prisons are still large providers of treatment to an affected population (aka we continue to criminalize mental illness). Very interesting how we have come so far, yet still have so far to go. "
1640,"I think the benefits of a registry of mentally ill persons does outweigh the costs. I base this mostly off of the evidence from the article we read this week on this topic. The article says 60 percent of deaths by firearm are suicide. Ergo, if we could better police this in order to prevent these deaths, that would be ideal. As the article also states, most people who have an unsuccessful suicide attempt do not go on to attempt suicide again. However, suicides by firearms are generally successful, and those people do not get that ""second chance."
1641,"I think the most important issue to ""fix"" is training, funding, and rehabilitative opportunities in prisons. The mentally ill will never not be disproportionally effected by the criminal justice system, in my opinion. I feel thats unrealistic. It's well documented that mental illnesses and criminal activity are often co-occurring. Because these two worlds are going to continue to have a high-level of contact, the criminal justice system needs to be required to have a better understanding of mental illness and how that manifests in the population they are having contact with. This means that the criminal justice system (at all levels) needs further funding to enable this to happen. This should be easy to do, in theory. We funnel a great deal of money into defense services to enable us to fight wars for other countries, we could redirect some of those funds to better serve this population. Finally, rehabilitative opportunities must be provided as this population needs to be treated not just punished."
1642,"I think this is very troublesome, reading about the ""Not In My Backyard"" policies and how even following deinstitutionalization and ""reintegration"" of the mentally ill into society the fear surrounding those who have a serious mental illness still negatively impacted their experience. To this day the mentally ill are disproportionately affected and stigmas regarding mental illness, especially serious mental illness are common. While depression and anxiety are often normalized (at least this has been my perception with my generation), disorders like schizophrenia or bipolar are very different animals for those not impacted are difficult to understand. Earlier on my commute I was listening to a podcast. In it they were talking about body positivity, however one sentiment really resonated with me and I feel is applicable here. They quoted Brene Brown, ""It's difficult to hate someone up close,"" a powerful sentiment in of itself. However, they continued to discuss that typically, people are only uncomfortable or fearful of things that feel foreign to them, things they can't understand. It's important to be mindful in these situations of  why something is making you feel fearful or uncomfortable. In lecture three it was discussed that those who actually have the most contact with the mentally ill are less likely to believe that they are dangerous. I think this is really illustrative of the problem here, people just don't understand - or have been misinformed - about PWMI. As society becomes more educated, they will in turn become more tolerant. However this is likely going to continue to be slow paced. "
1643,"Alyse, Great post! I thought the section of the lecture discussing the Greek and Roman's ideologies on treating the mentally ill was also interesting. I had not learned about this beforehand. It's curious how we began down the humane and ethical treatment path of those with PWMI at this time, only to go in the complete opposite direction for the greater extent of history, and then return back to what they started now. I appreciate your sentiment that such integration gives them more autonomy and self-determination.   "
1644,"Hey guys, excellent discussion.  It's incredibly sad to think that being born with, or developing, a mental illness can at times result in a life-sentence almost. Rather than being afforded the life and liberties that most people receive individuals with serious mental illness at least aren't typically given this privilege  especially when economic or educational disadvantages are also factors. No one should feel that they don't belong in a group or society. Hopefully ours continues to grow in a direction of inclusiveness for all individuals, including those with PWMI. "
1645,"I don't believe a president can be effective in bringing about an end to stigma of mental illness nor do I think that is their role or responsibility, honestly. However, a president can start a conversation regarding mental illness and aid in normalizing having mental illness. I think if anything the president can set the tone for how the nation perceives mental illness and how we respond to it. I suppose for some people perhaps hearing the president say mental illness is okay might make them feel more comfortable around others with mental illness or perhaps seeking treatment for a mental illness they are facing. "
1646,"I think it's clear that mental health care is not seen as necessary or valuable as health care, which is already sorely lacking and inaccessible in this country. However, these types of attitudes, though not explicitly stating it, create a climate that says mental illness is not as ""real"" as physical aliments like cancer or a broken bone. It should never be an issue of classism to decide who does and does not receive health services. There shouldn't be a price tag on how valuable your life and your needs are. "
1647,"I work with the military at Fort Irwin currently, the army specifically. It has not been my experience that any of them are highly receptive to talk therapy, and are even more hesitant about treatment with psychotropic medications. However, the biggest turn-offs I hear are that talk therapy is frustrating when the psychologist isn't prior service because they find them un-relatable and that psychotropic medications isn't an option because they don't like the feeling of not being ""in control."" I think increasing services with relatable talk therapy would be beneficial. "
1648,"No, I don't think society should be allowed to ""step in"" and mandate treatment so long as the individual is not a threat to themselves or others. If the individual has a potential to be violent or cause harm to themselves than I believe society is obligated to intervene. However, outside of this circumstance I don't think it's appropriate nor necessarily helpful to intervene. It's clear that you can't help people who don't want to be helped. If someone suffering from PWMI is not ready to actively engage in some form of treatment, the success of that treatment will be seriously limited. "
1649,"This is such a great question! I have always maintained that middle schools and high schools should have criminal justice courses where they learn their rights and how the system works, but I've never considered having courses like this on mental illness. I think that some schools kind of do, it's simply included in the curricula of health classes.  I think that the most powerful way to normalize and start a discussion regarding stigma and PWMI would be to have guest speakers at school events come in. Something a little ""different"" and ""fun"" that gets students out of class and engaged in something exciting outside of their day-to-day schedule. This could get people really listening and engaged in the message being promoted. Holding ""working groups"" almost like this could be an excellent way to not just throw information at students but to begin a dialogue. This could be continued through outreach and ally programs or clubs that a school could form. We know that PWMI can feel isolated. Knowing you aren't alone in what you're feeling and experiencing can be a powerful things. These groups could of course be run by the school counselor, so that accurate information and help is delivered. Something along these lines would also provide at least some form of mental health services to those who may not otherwise have access or coverage.  Mostly, I think messages should first target students who may have a mental illness. Acknowledging something and ""speaking your truth"" can take away the power that that thing holds over you. Helping students feel seen should be a main priority. Educating peers of those with PWMI on the realities of mental health, and debunking myths surrounding mental illness would enable those students who may be struggling with mental illness to feel more comfortable as well. "
1650,"Hey, Stephanie! Definitely think a CJ class would be a great option. After taking juvenile justice it was unsettling to think about how important that would be for some students, especially those in lower socioeconomic positions. But yes! I think it's one thing to give someone the information and entirely other thing for them to really hear the information. Something a lot of my coworkers say is message sent doesn't necessarily mean message received, that really resonated with me. Clubs would enable people to engage a bit more."
1651,"Hey, Bobbie! That's honestly shocking to me that they are cutting health curriculum from schools! I went to a very small rural high school and feel out of touch with several peoples experiences. Do you know why they chose to cut that class? I assume its finances, that's just an interesting budget cut choice I feel. I guess if that is the case having another separate formal class regarding mental health would be hard pressed to make happen.  But anyways! Your questions. I think that starting the conversation and educating students about mental health throughout their life course would be beneficial and would make that dialogue completely normal, since it's always occurred. We tell kids about being physically sick when they are younger. We can also talk about feelings and emotions with younger kids. How you talk about mental health would just in turn change as students age and in turn mature. "
1652,"Hey, Steve! Your point about kids, especially middle schoolers, being bullies to people who deviate from the ""norm"" is so incredibly true. That is absolutely a concern of mine as well. I think that being scared to be yourself because of judgement from peers is a really hard place to be in. On the other hand I think respecting and honoring your boundaries and not discussing things until you're ready is important, too. And a mental illness doesn't define you, and if a child doesn't want to put that label on themselves or come forward about that with their peers that's okay! I just think having speakers and clubs available to encourage an environment that says it's okay to talk about those issues if that's what you choose to do.  That's a good point though, and a harsh reality of what would likely happen. "
1653,"This was really interesting! Whenever discussions surrounding psychology are framed in a more medical based explanation or illustration I always think, ""Oh this will help people better understand this!"" But now I'm just thinking back to last weeks lessons where we read an article discussing that talking about mental illness in a medical framework actually created more stigma around it. Wild. I think that this does a good job explaining how you can't have your cake and eat it too. I guess you'd have to think about public safety and risk to ones self as the ""urgency"" on sensitivity vs. specificity. If society at the time deems these to be really important (being mindful that it will no doubt create some ""false positives"" and ""false negatives"") then we could increase the sensitivity regarding involuntary or civil commitment. I'd argue that we used to function this way and around the time of deinstitutionalization there was a drastic shift in this thinking where we decreased the sensitivity in an effort to increase the specificity and that we are still currently at this point.  "
1654,"We discussed this in forensic assessment! I definitely don't agree with involuntary commitment of sex offenders after completing their sentences is a horrible idea. Regardless of what the supreme court has said on the issue I still strongly feel as though this type of action is unconstitutional. Furthermore research has demonstrated that sex offenders are actually very unlikely to re-offend. Also not every sex offender necessarily has a mental illness. While some issues are clearly complex, this one isn't for me. This is just wrong."
1655,"I certainly believe that inpatient commitment is a larger reach of state authority on an individuals liberty. As discussed, outpatient treatment cannot really be enforced and still allows the individual a level of autonomy and free will. This is not the case with inpatient civil commitment. Furthermore, as we saw in the second video of the last lecture the ""treatment"" facilities for patients (at least for sexually offenders) are sorely lacking and are more akin to prisons than hospitals. "
1656,"This is a tricky situation. I think that we do need to work on limiting the use of involuntary inpatient commitment while simultaneously expanding resources to better use and access of outpatient treatment. As the authors of the text note that while many states have outpatient treatment as an ""option"" those services being available aren't guaranteed. The text sites reasons for not using outpatient treatment as an option such as liability concerns, stagnancy, lack of funding/resources/infrastructure, and skepticism of the law (Chapter 5). While all of these may feel reasonable, I find that they seem a bit like tired excuses to what could be a better option. The text notes that inpatient commitment can be counterintuitive to therapeutic relationships with research demonstrating that such coercive treatment can actually be more damaging to a patient long term than helpful, making them increasingly wary of the system and its ""police"" power (Chapter 4). The text cites numerous other reasons why an individual should be rightfully skeptical about civil commitment, such as it creating stigmas, discriminatory practices, and it being an industry driven by money. However, the bottom line is that if a system put in place to protect an individual and their best interest is actually leaving them worse off than when they entered the system, as some research has demonstrated (Chapter 4), then that's a system we need to put on pause and seriously address. Medical professionals take an oath to first do no harm, yet the book sites Campbell (2002) stating, ""People with mental illness are often skeptical of the system to begin with, and when the state starts invoking its police power to take away their liberties, they are less likely to seek treatment voluntarily in a community mental health setting."" Granted this could be for a variety of reasons, but the bottom line is that the treatment afforded to patients in involuntary treatment facilities is subpar at best and arguably a waste of funding as currently stands. That being said I of course also believe that their are times where involuntary civil commitment is in the best interest of both the patient and the people around said patient. However the text notes that the current standard of proof for committing an individual is ""clear and convincing evidence."" This evidence can also be fudged a bit to check all the boxes needed to civilly commit. Chapter 4 of the text cites Fisher & Grisso (2010) who found that judges, l"
1657,"Hey, Gabi! I really like your comment about measuring success by identifying if PWMI are less ""dangerous"" after receiving treatment from a civil commitment facility or a prison. That's very interesting. I'll have to see if there is research available on this. The text was very upsetting to read that people who go into civil commitment treatment often fare worse than those who do not, due to it being forced upon them and stripping them of their liberties.  It's tough because as you mentioned, if these facilities are focusing on their bottom dollar and not the best interests of their patients we can't measure success because they are inherently not successful. I made a similar note stating if this was the case than they were simply a waste of funds and should be done away with.  Based on your response would you say you are a greater advocate for outpatient treatment?"
1658,"Suz, great post! I agree that there are some major issues with forcing treatment on individuals who aren't open to it, whether thats inpatient or outpatient. However as we know there are certainly times where this is necessary. Do you have any ideas on how we could go about making this treatment more comfortable for those who's rights are being infringed upon? I think this could be a good stepping stone towards being more effective in general. As we all know the saying goes you can't help those that don't want to be helped. It would be interesting if we could create facilities that maybe didn't feel so rigid or industrial and made people more open to the idea of help.  Great post, though!"

1660,"I think that this would depend on what mental illness an individual was dealing with and their IQ and their financial means. I think that every step of the criminal process could potentially create different issues and difficulties for PWMI, though. "
1661,"I think it's good that PWMI won't be as heavily criminalized for their mental illnesses, however they also might not have the opportunities to receive services for their mental illnesses either with such a shift. That being said I think a strong argument could be made that even prior to the changes with all of the over-crowding that has been (and continues) to occur PWMI likely weren't receiving services of any quality that would be noticeably beneficial. I think that until legislation is passed specifically addressing the lack of funding and the needs for further resources allocated to the treatment of mental illness and sustaining that treatment we will continue to have prisons that are at maximum capacity and are ill-equipped.  "
1662,"I don't know if it's necessarily ""fair."" However I would say that it's simply a part of the job, and if it isn't something an individual is okay or comfortable dealing with than they probably shouldn't go into law enforcement. More police officers today are going in after having gone to school to obtain a bachelors degree, often times in criminal justice. My alma mater is known for their criminal justice program and several cops in our state graduated from there. I know in every criminal justice course I took this was discussed, so I can't imagine too many individuals are joining the police force and feeling blind sided. Do I think police officers are equipped to deal with PWMI? No. I think police departments should have mental health professionals employed through them on staff 24/7 who are capable of doing intake and screenings. "
1663,I think that CIT could dispel some stigmas and increase officer awareness and ability to engage with PWMI. I also think stigma or bias could shape how perceptive and likely to utilize CIT an officer may be. Either way I think that the video illustrating what they're doing in Memphis is a wonderful model that should be implemented across the board. As the lecture said CIT has been linked to fewer police officer deaths and fewer deaths or suicides of PWMI. I think that this really illustrates that CIT can help reduce stigma and aid officers in viewing PWMI as people rather than potential threats. 
1664,"The Taheri findings detailed 8 studies in their review of the effectiveness of CIT evaluating outcomes related to arrest reduction, officer use of force, and officer injury. Despite the Memphis CIT program being implemented 20 years ago little is known on how much of a difference this type of training results in. The research that does exist on this topic is often taken with a grain of salt due to its quality and methodologies. Thus a meta-analysis on the current research was warranted. However Taheri ultimately concluded that the effectiveness of CIT is essentially null as currently stands. In regards to officers arrests of PWMI only 6 of the 8 studies being analyzed measured these effects and only 5 of those had viable data. The findings varied widely based on the study with some studies indicating significantly fewer arrests of PWMI , others showing no effects, and one showing negative effects. 7 of the 8 studies measured CITs impact on officers use of force. However combined, the effects of CIT on use of force was null. CITs impact on officer injury is still a grey area, with only 2 of the studies even collecting data on the subject. There was not enough research for the analysis of this to be conclusive. That's not to say that CIT did not benefit officers or the community. Officers who had undergone CIT transported PWMI to community-based services rather than arresting far more frequently than comparison groups. Personally I like the improvement suggested in the Taheri findings in reference to Ruiz, advocating for police departments to differentiate between call for service codes that identify calls made requesting service for mentally ill and calls made for breaking the law. They explain that this would have three major benefits, being; it increases citizens likelyhood to engage with police and view them as individuals who can also support the needs of the community, not simply enforce order; targets stigma and criminalization of mental illness (thus reinforcing CIT goals); and lastly it would make the evaluation of CIT effectiveness easier to obtain. Reflecting on this weeks lectures we watched a Youtube video discussing the Memphis CIT program specifically. Keeping in mind this was biased reporting, the officers did say that even officers beginning the training skeptical were 'believers' by the end of it and felt it did better equip them to handle PWMI in crisis and target stigmas. Personally I find that if officers hold these convictions, that"
1665,"Hey, Suz! I really like your point about this training being mandatory for officers rather than optional. Sure, a lot of the effects of the Taheri report are null. However you also indicated a lot of reasons why that is. On top of that reflecting back on the Youtube video detailing the Memphis CIT program it discussed how many hours of training officers go through for various other things in comparison to CIT generally. The comparison is 40-some-odd-hours to 4 or so hours in most places. It just makes sense to me that in an industry that has so much known contact and interaction with PWMI having training and understanding of dealing with PWMI would be a given. Great ideas! Thank you!"
1666,"Hey, Natalie! I really enjoyed reading your post and how you summarized the ideas and findings of the Taheri article. I think that we had a very similar view on how to move forward with this. In fact based on the responses I read I think the majority of our cohort is in the same camp of despite Taheri finding null results implementation  of CIT should continue and if anything, become more widespread. I agree that this shouldn't be an optional training but a mandatory requirement to be an officer for the same reason you did. In comparison to other trainings that are 40+ hours in duration, most officers only receive 4 hours of training that is CIT oriented. I also agree with your final remarks regarding CIT benefiting everyone. Great post and great job articulating your thoughts in a well thought out manner! "
1667,"I think it's easy to say that this would be awful. I don't think anyone wants to be arrested and jailed more than 100 times. This is an odd question. But the fact that this isn't uncommon is VERY illustrative of how broken our criminal justice system is. Yet here we are, continuing to funnel money and resources into the same system and cycle that isn't working. "
1668,"  Pre/Post treatment measures - i.e. inmate comes in and is found to have disorder and extent of disorder, inmate is treated, then measure the extent of disorder again to measure if the treatment has been helpful Recidivism - are inmates given the right tools to be successful outside of the system upon exiting? Inmates perceptions on treatment received in jails/prisons... are those actually receiving the services feeling as though they are beneficial...?"
1669,"This is tricky. I think that the provisions in place currently are in place for very valid reasons. I also don't think that anyone working in corrections are intentionally over-stepping or mis-treating inmates. However when working in an incredibly stress-inducing environment trying to establish and maintain control over an unpredictable population I can empathize with why, at times, corrections officers might make some bad calls and not treat inmates how they should be. This of course doesn't make it okay. This makes the inmates having rights that they can exercise so important. Maintaining some autonomy I think would be essential to the ego. That being said I do think that it would just be unrealistic for those rights to extend farther than they currently do. "
1670,"I think that this is likely the de facto means of treating mental illness because it doesn't require staffing of psychologists or psychiatrists in the jail/prison. It also could serve as a liability safeguard (i.e. we were doing something to treat said inmate, he was on medication...). It's a quick and ""easy"" fix. Rather than coordinating and shuffling inmates around to appointments you just administer a pill. It's also something that can be ""forced"" upon an inmate. As we heard in the previous lecture while inmates are still afforded some constitutional rights they can't necessarily deny treatment. This means that inmates can be forced to take medication, which is arguably easier to do than get someone to actively engage in a therapy session. "
1671,"I think that using jails for the seriously mentally ill is disastrous. This week we had to write a paper. Mine referenced a story from NBC news detailing a mother express her concerns over her paranoid schizophrenic sons high level of contact with the police, and the police department in Denver's push to implement programming to better serve members of the community like him. In the article she says, “If you were sick with cancer, they’re not going to stick you in jail for 84 days until they find a place to get you care (Dawson, 2019)."" She was referencing the time he had to spend two months in a jail cell while awaiting a bed at the states mental health hospital. This weeks readings exemplify this problem. Torrey et. al (2010) found that there is roughly 1 psychiatric bed per every 3,000 people in the United States, making the situation individuals with mental illness today face similar conditions to the 1840s - I'd like to think things could have gotten better since then. It's high time we decriminalize mental illness. While California has made a push to realignment policy changes we know that this has largely shifted the burden from state prisons to county jails and probation, where inmates may be even less likely to receive treatment for mental illness, reflecting back on week fours lectures. From weeks four reading, California's Historic Corrections Reforms, found that while prison populations did decrease as a result of these actions county jails felt the ramifications of this experiencing an increase of about 10,000 inmates. On top of that, these changes have not decreased recidivism rates, which is arguably the true measure of success when discussing criminal justice's effectiveness.  "
1672,"Stephanie, I couldn't agree more. All the research we have come across thus far has demonstrated how harmful prison or jail can be to a person with mental illness. Torrey et. al (2010) found that PWMI tend to be ""frequent flyers"" of prisons, they cost more, stay longer, are difficult to manage in a prison population, are more likely to commit suicide, and are more likely to be abused. While PWMI may have broken the law, they are essentially being penalized for their mental illness. The current system creates a cyclical environment where PWMI continue through a revolving door of being in and out of the system. This is not cost effective nor is it helpful to any parties involved.  Great post!"
1673,"Hey, Sayla - Great post! I think it's great how everyone seems to be on the same page in thinking that there is no excuse for PWMI frequenting our prisons and jails so often and that this is not the proper environment for them to be in. The Torrey article was very unsettling and illustrative. I really enjoyed reading through the breakdown at the state levels and hearing how many similar problems being faced. It's high time for changes to be made. With all these budget cuts it's really just putting a bandaid on the actual issue. We will continue to have to spend astronomical funds until we address the real issue - recidivism. PWMI are likely to be frequent flyers and until they are given lasting treatment that is conducive to getting them out of the system and breaking that cycle we will continue to have these discussions and go in circles. "
1674,"I don't think that using risk assessment tools should be the end all be all of decisions. I think that we have to make choices with the tools, resources and knowledge available to us at that time. I think having anything that is 100% accurate is hard to come by, especially in the realm of psychology. Humans are hard to pin. That being said, I don't think risk assessments should be seen as ""fair"" or ""unfair."" Ultimately they are only being used to formulate an opinion on how to best move forward for all parties involved. So, to restate, these shouldn't be used as a sole means of making a decision on probation, but could be used in conjunction with other means like good time served, clinical interviews, etc. "
1675,"I would imagine that it would depend on the mental health professional, though I'd assume that should the research on RNR approaches to PWMI in the justice system continues to be positive and favorable than mental health professionals would be advocates. Mental health professionals should always be crusaders of justice, and therefore advocates of whatever means are available to best make that happen. I'd imagine that other factors than recidivism would be the second stipulation of the RNR model, their needs. This really just goes back to Maslow and his hierarchy of needs. If an individual doesn't have basic needs met they are going to act very differently than an individual who does, etc. "
1676,"I think jails and probation face similar obstacles in this arena. While both are tasked with ""behavioral change"" as this video puts it, they usually don't have the budget to effectively make that happen. Or at least the budget they have isn't being allocated in a manner which enables that goal being met. Probation officers often don't have the training to effectively serve PWMI and probation officers case loads can be unrealistically stacked for them to actually supervise treatment. "
1677,"Questions like this are tough because I think it's really hard to put yourself in someones shoes like this and can diminish the experiences of others. I don't think you know how you react until you're actually placed in those situations, and I also can't relate to having a serious mental illness. I'd imagine that I'd prefer to work in the mental health court because clearly this would long-term have more beneficial value to myself and my mental health. That being said persons with serious mental illness might not believe they have a mental illness or be capable of fully understanding what's ""best"" for them. So... that's tough."
1678,"RNR implementation in probation simply makes sense. This is very reminisent of Maslow's hierarchy of needs in my opinion. Currently I work with human intelligence in the army. The ""collectors"" as they are called will often use Maslow's hierarchy of needs as a way to assess a sources motivations and desires. Like Peterson et al (2014) found very few crimes are committed by PWMI that are solely linked to manifestations of their symptoms. In fact the research demonstrated that even under broad definitions of symptoms only about one fifth of crimes committed by PWMI were mostly or completely linked to their symptoms. Therefore summing up criminal activity to being the result of mental illness is a cop out. It's an easy way to write off or ""explain"" something we don't want to take responsibility for as a society - crimes aren't committed by PWMI because of symptoms, they're committed as a reaction to a system that has disenfranchised them and communities that haven't offered support. I think that the mental health courts discussed are a great starting point for shifting the discussion and prosecution of PWMI. I think organizing a ""team"" of support for PWMI is crucial to their supervision. Back to Maslow, are their basic needs being met? I think finding housing, finding the right medication as well as talk therapy, etc. and making sure that these resources will be sustained beyond the terms of their probation is critical to long term success in this field. The only way to reduce recidivism in the United States is to make citizens of the United States feel supported and secure. "
1679,"Hi, Jennifer! Great post. I really enjoyed the detailed explanations you gave for every facet of this, breaking down concepts and your suggestions. I can't say that I have much to add on here. All of your ideas are really well reasoned and grounded in the research. I like how you offered several ideas to add into the effectiveness and drew upon a wide variety of avenues that could be taken in this overall goal. I think all and all this week has been very illustrative of the multifaceted approach that must be taken in this arena in order to bring about effective and sustainable long term change and reduction in recidivism rates."
1680,"Hey, Steve! I loved reading this response. I think it was really creative to format it in an email forum and break the research down like this. It made your ideas easy to follow, the information digestible, and your recommendations clear and concise. I'm interested in your desire to put in place a risk assessment tool despite their problems. Would this be central in probation decision making processes? I recall going in-depth regarding the utilization of these tools despite their accuracy in Scurich's class. Anyways, great post and great ideas!"
1681,"I think that this is a theme we've been discussing for a while. The feeling of helplessness/hopelessness that would arise from a bleak future and idle time, the inability to let your guard down due to the chaotic and often times dangerous environment of a prison, fears regarding what life will realistically look like on the outside, frustration with self and others, etc. "
1682,"I'd argue that we absolutely can. Reflecting back on last week we read a study that found that symptoms manifesting from mental disorders were only directly related to crimes approximately 4-6% of the time, roughly (if I'm recalling that number correctly). Rather crime was committed by individuals with mental illness largely due to other factors such as lack of financial security, i.e. lack of housing, food, etc. Absolutely we need to continue to treat those with mental illness outside of time served and increase access to community programs designed for that, however I think it's reasonable to assume these individuals absolutely can and do reintegrate back into society post release when proper structures are in place."
1683,I don't think that there are advantages as currently stands because it's way over-used from my understanding. What can be deemed as dangerous is very broad and then the length of time that solitary is then implemented for an individual is just absurd. I think that the ramifications for the well-being of an inmate that spends time in solitary confinement while serving there sentence can have hugely negative impacts on their ability to reintegrate into society post-release. I'd go so far as to say that the use of solitary confinement is a form of cruel and unusual punishment and that it should be deemed a constitutional violation. 
1684,"I'm completely fine with my tax dollars being spent on treating the mentally ill in prison. My tax dollars are already going towards the prison system which I don't feel like does anything, and I do feel that funding towards rehabilitation programs (such as mental health care) within the penile system is a better use of my tax dollars than other mechanisms. I'd be happy with this, actually."
1685,"The question of how can prisons meet the need to keep inmates and staff safe, provide treatment for PWMI, and contain costs is interesting. We are currently trying to do all three of these things in our prison system while spending $81 billion dollars a year according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics ( https://eji.org/news/mass-incarceration-costs-182-billion-annually/). But that is just the cost of prisons, jails, probation and parole. When tallying up police, courts, and costs paid by loved ones with family members in prison, that figure looks more like $182 billion (Equal Justice Initiative). And for what? For 76.6% of those individuals being sent to prison turning around and going back within five years of release (Bureau of Justice Statistics). We are already spending an egregious amount of money on this system in the United States, only that money is being poorly managed and allocated towards ineffective means. Considering that there is already a budget (and a large one at that) for prisons, it only makes sense to me for this to be re-examined and for funds to start being redirected, largely towards rehabilitative means, including treatment of PWMI.  In reference to if inmates with mental illness should receive more resources than those without I'd argue that inmates with mental illness (depending on the MI and severity) should not be inmates and should be treated in a psychiatric facility. However considering that since deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill prisons have become de facto psychiatric wards, that is unrealistic. Ergo, I do believe that PWMI should receive ""more"" resources that those without mental illness - more simply meaning means to treat their mental illness. Persons without mental illness simply don't need all the resources an individual with mental illness does, i.e. medication, therapy, closer monitoring at times, etc. However being in prison should not mean that needs go un-met. If an inmate had a broken leg, that would not go untreated. Psychiatric symptoms should be considered in the same light.  In close I feel that shifting funding towards scientifically based programming objectives (rehabilitation) will ultimately save states money in resources being allocated towards their criminal justice systems. By reducing the amount of individuals that leave prison and jails just to wind up back there we in turn"
1686,"Serenity, Absolutely! It's not as if they are getting ""more"" resources, as those resources would be available for  all inmates to utilize if or when they need to. To me this is simple, should inmates have medical care? They should, and part of that is mental health care. The budget is certainly there, and data would demonstrate that some shifts in policy may be beneficial to treatment outcomes.  I'm glad we are on the same page here!"
1687,"Suz, Great post! I couldn't agree more, as I had similar reasoning in my own response. I really enjoyed the solutions that you outlined, drawing upon Adams and Ferrandino (2008). I also felt that by providing better quality and more effective treatment for mental health while in prison we in turn successfully reintegrate that individual back into the community and reduce the likelihood of recidivism. Considering over half the population in prison is dealing with a mental illness, as you referenced, and these individuals are more likely to reoffend it makes sense that 76.6% of offenders are re-arrested 5 years post release. I did, however, feel a bit different in one aspect though. I don't feel that PWMI are receiving ""more"" resources, they're just getting what they need. In my post I used the example that if an inmate broke their leg it would be treated and mental illness should be handled in the same way. Great post!"
1688,I think this is so wonderful! I'd be thrilled to be living in a state that was prioritizing this type of programing and would feel like my tax dollars were really going towards something I supported. I'd have no issues with my money being utilized for such a worthy cause and smart investment. Especially considering Missouri is home to Washington U with one of the best psychology programs in the U.S. I think this could be a really great teaching opportunity and learning hospital. 
1689,"Absolutely not. This goes back to the whole issue of this course, the criminalization of mental illness. Absolutely when an individual with MI commits a horrid crime they should be accountable for those actions, that's only fair and what is due to the victims of said crime and their families, the safety of society, and the individual with MI who deserves the rights to treatment. The insanity plea is only used in 1% of cases and is only successful in a quarter of those cases, meaning its implemented incredibly rarely. If this defense is successful it means that individuals will be held accountable still, just in a manner that is actually beneficial to them and society - to treat them. "
1690,"I don't feel like I have a good answer to this question. However I think that a really great starting point to resolving this issue would be to just have proper staffing in place to support this operation. That alone would resolve a lot of issues I feel, and some of that staffing could include security officers."
1691,"I think this is so fantastic! Clearly this isn't being used or advocated as a first option to treatment but rather a ""last resort"" hail Mary used in only the most severe cases of depression. I think the patient featured in this video exemplifies why a potentially risky surgery in a situation like this may not be such a bad idea. When she was asked about side effects and risks leaving her hesitant she said no. Probably because in a severe case of depression the idea of continuing to feel the way you do each day vs. potential serious risks (death) may not be a hard gamble to make, especially if the reward is being able to authentically feel joy in a way you haven't in years. "
1692,"This is a tricky question. As we’ve been learning deinstitutionalization, or the mass closure and restructuring of asylums and psychiatric facilities in the 1960s and 70s, was actually just transinstitutionalization (Sisti et. al, 2015). As the doors were shut on these facilities following media coverage of the horrors occurring within their walls resulted in mass numbers of PWMI being pushed back on to the streets, with little resources for outpatient treatment and minimal infrastructure for community support in place. As a result, the criminal justice system has barred the weight of this policy initiative. With nowhere else to turn PWMI moved to nursing homes, homeless shelters, general hospitals and ERs, leaning on individuals ill-equipped and under-trained in dealing with such a population. The, at times, erratic behavior of PWMI or their means of sustaining themselves (petty theft, sleeping in the streets, etc.) pushes this population into police hands. Prisons are, in turn, “de facto” psychiatric facilities with roughly half of all inmates having a mental illness or substance abuse disorder, often times co-occurring (Sisti et. al, 2015). However, PWMI are a lot costlier for prisons to house than an inmate without mental illness, $30,000-$50,000 compared to $22,000, respectively (Sisti et. al, 2015). The treatment that hikes this cost of housing up is riddled with issues, though. The Supreme Court has already come to a consensus that the quality of the prison’s treatment of PWMI constituted cruel and unusual punishment and that both new housing and better treatment must be provided for these inmates. PWMI are, based on this weeks’ readings, 2-3 times more likely to be incarcerated upon release (Sisti et. al, 2015), however this may be a conservative estimate. In turn this is ultimately a costlier “treatment” option than a state hospital would be, as it results in a cyclical pattern of disadvantage. At the start of this week I likely would have said that re-instating asylums, or psychiatric hospitals, was a poor idea. I would have cited the horrors that both articles referenced this week, the atrocious and unethical conditions patients were facing prior to deinstitutionalization, as reasons against such a decision. However, Sisti et. al (2015) poses valid reasoning why this shift would make sense and Fisher, Geller, and Pandiani (2009) pose viable ways to do this in an effective manner. These ideas include working with police and jud"
1693,"Asia, Thanks for the comment! I'm glad to hear we are on similar pages here. I think a really strong point in making this deliberate shift is the fact that DSH's report states that 90% of its patients are already forensic. Making this move towards housing forensic patients will not only move us away from criminalizing mental illness but it will also likely increase the amounts of funds/grants state hospitals can get to increase training on how to aid this unique population. "
1694,"Hey Viviana, I totally agree that state prisons should play an even increased role. I think that we should reallocate funds to state hospitals and make them into psychiatric facilities or asylums again - this time ethically, of course. According to the DSH report state hospitals are already largely focused on forensic patients, with 90% of their capacity being forensic. You raised a good point though, psychiatrists working within the CJ system have dual allegiance to their patients and to their employer (the CJ system be it the courts the prison, etc.) and this can compromise confidentiality and seriously diminish treatment goals and effectiveness. I think this would be a massive step forward in reducing the criminalization of mental illness! Very nice discussion post!"
1695,"I think this week has been very informative and has attested to the fact that data sharing between these systems is lackluster at best. I really liked the discussion from YouTube linked above and the point made when asked this same question. He put it simply, increasing community based mental health services so that we are able to identify members of the community in need of these services prior to their getting involved in the criminal justice system is very clearly the most desired solution. This would just help with completely ending the criminalization of those with mental illness and get them the help they need before they engage in illegal activity. However this may be unrealistic so I think increasing training of corrections officers and other jail staff as to the importance of this topic is another means to accomplishing this shared goal."
1696,I think that this makes a huge difference! If nothing else I think that it would equip officers and other responders to feel confident when approaching a situation because they'd have the tools to handle it appropriately. Having CIT training would assist in deescalating a situation and not meeting that situation with force. If a responder goes into a crisis situation and meets that distraught person with more anxiety and nerves and uneasiness that they are in turn feeling as a result of not knowing how to communicate with them it'll only exacerbate the situation. It also eases community members minds that they can reach out for help when they need it without fear that they will be persecuted for doing so. 
1697,"I think that when you are working in an environment like this you can get a group think mentality and think that this type of treatment and behavior is okay. I mean everyone is aware of the Stanford prison study and we saw what happened there. That was in a simulated lab but it's not a far stretch to think that that is just illustrative of what happens in real life. I think that sometimes it does unfortunately take an outsiders perspective to be like okay, lets reign it back in and look at what we are doing and the ramifications of those actions."
1698,"I think the largest challenge would just be overcoming potential biases that the correctional officers and other prison staff may carry. I think that working in a prison, depending on the funding and staffing and type of inmate and a whole host of other variables could very likely lead to staff in that environment being stressed, burnt out, and ""hardened."" I think cross training could break down some concerns correctional officers may have about mental health initiatives potentially compromising prioritizing safety. I think that cross-training would just be a very effective means of de-bunking stigmas regarding these practices. "
1699,"This is a tough question. Logically I want to say that these trainings outlined this week are essential to mental health and criminal justice actors to being most beneficial to PWMI. However, in previous weeks readings and in Watson & Fulambarker (2012) from this week they've made it extremely clear that crisis intervention training (CIT) is not an established evidence based practice. It's my concern that until research actually demonstrates that a training program is explicitly linked to aiding how we serve this population it'll be hard pressed to have any sort of legislation passed funding these initiatives. The Watson & Fulambarker article does explain how, in theory, the development and implementation of CIT in a community can be beneficial to key stakeholders in the mental health process. Mental health providers and police can have a rigid relationship fraught with misunderstanding how the other group handles PWMI. This can create a cycle that ultimately costs a community more money and doesn't get to the core of the problem. Mental health providers find police officers to be insensitive to PWMI and police officers find mental health professionals to be laxidasical in their approach and want hospitals to do more with individuals brought to them, rather than pushing them back onto the streets for the PD to deal with later, again. CIT then implements a more collaborative approach to how we tackle PWMIs contact with the criminal justice system from a more holistic approach. Personally I feel that this just makes sense, however it's a tough position to be in because as we've seen the research just isn't quite there yet. If nothing else I'd say this can't hurt. The Parker (2009) article on the other hand does offer a different perspective, though he researches something a bit different than CIT, per se. He finds that the implementation of just ten hours of mental health training for correctional officers working in special housing units had a significant drop in both use of force as well as battery by bodily waste. The researchers attributed this decline in use of force to the focus of interacting skills highlighted in the later portion of the training. While less clear why inmates were less likely to retaliate against officers following the NAMI training it would seem logical to me that this was simply due to an improved relationship between the COs and PWMI in the housing units. Based on this evidence I would advocate that a good ""star"
1700,"Hey, Denise! Oh I'm totally with you on your thoughts regarding the CIT model. However I'm also thinking about this from a practical perspective and if the goal is to get this training to be standard across jurisdictions I find it very unlikely that any law maker would be able to allocate funding to support CIT training without concrete numbers to back up its effectiveness. Just seems unlikely to me.  Also the 10 hours of training isn't for police officers, if you read the article. It's for correctional officers working in special housing units or supermax units (units that hold PWMI). "
1701,"Hey Shayda, I'm glad you saw what I was trying to explain regarding my reservations on CIT. While in theory it does seem like best practice I think it's unreasonable for us to expect widespread use or implementation when the data just doesn't quite support this. Perhaps after more extensive research is done on the use of the model with more profound or positive results this would be more feasible.  The NAMI training is clearly effective based on the available data, its more cost effective and less time consuming. This seems fairly cut and clear to me.  I like what you mentioned about the idea of having an application on your phone with tips and tricks on how to deal with PWMI, especially when in crisis. Even if a CO couldn't access this information while on the floor perhaps during a break or meal of a particularly trying shift they could reference the application for advice and guidance. Great feedback!"
1702,I think they likely focus on the non-violent offender because mental health facilities might not be equipped with safety or security measures to safely house a potentially violent offender with mental illness. I believe that we could equip mental health facilities with the capacity to both treat and house a potentially violent offender. That violent offender would likely be much less prone to acts of violence if they received services they needed at mental health facility as opposed to the rigid environment of lock-up. 
1703,"I think that the hurdles are different because these are different fields. Criminal justice systems were not designed or implemented with the idea of servicing individuals with mental illness, it's a new by-product of deinstitutionalization that the criminal justice system is trying to maneuver. Mental health agencies are systematically designed and intended to service PWMI. Therefore the hurdles these systems are trying to jump over are largely different with some cross over, like a vin diagram. However I would imagine that it is much easier for mental health agencies to have access to knowledge on evidence-based practices within their field as mental health practitioners are generally required to stay up to date on the latest in the field and continue training annually. Criminal justice actors also have these requirements but they look very different. "
1704,"I think that these are the type of systems that target those individuals that are being ""recycled"" through the justice system, as previous lectures put it. This is essentially a jail diversion program and the cost savings in states where this is being effectively implemented (such as CT described in the video) will be tremendous. I think this will also greatly improve community relations between police and civilians. Ultimately mental health and substance abuse go hand in hand, its my belief that at the very least you cannot effectively treat substance abuse without treating mental health. What a terrific program!"
1705,"I still this a lot when I'm talking with people in the military. They are experiencing mental illnesses but they do not feel comfortable talking to any therapists that haven't been prior service and experienced deployment because they aren't relatable to the audience. I think that having a peer makes you feel like what you are saying is being understood, not just heard. I also think it creates a safer space where an individual feels they are meeting minds with someone and not being judged. "
1706,"Non-medical considerations have driven provision of treatment and care for persons with mental illnesses  in different ways. The non medical considerations before the Renaissance times were very poor and not helpful. In the pre civilization times they were killed if seen as a ""threat to the clan"" or parts of their skull were removed. In ancient civilization they were treated with laxatives and surgery. However, in Ancient Greeks and Romans they realized that people wth mental illness should be treated better. However, in the Middle Ages 600,000 - 9 million people of ""outcasts"" were tortured and killed by drowning and burning. Finally, the provision of treatment and care began when the first hospital for confinement of ""lunatics"" opened in the Renaissance period. Then in 1773 the first psychiatric Asylum was opened in Virginia. Although the institutions began to open the treatment approaches was greatly criticized and the location the hospitals had to built at were not the best for adequate treatment. The financial support needed for treatment is not always there as well depending on the political party in office at the time."
1707,"Before watching the videos of this lecture I did believe that we should always be safe rather than sorry especially in regards to gun violence that has been happening recently. My thinking was that even though people with mental illnesses take up such a small amount of people who actually act violent it would still be better to be safe than sorry and that the benefits do outweigh the costs. However, after watching the video of Lynette Phillips, in terms of reducing gun violence, I now do not think the benefits of a national registry of mentally ill persons outweigh the costs. I think this because people with mental illnesses are being extremely stereotyped. I think that instead of focusing on people with mental illnesses hurting others we should be worrying about them hurting themselves. Also, we should be focusing on taking guns from people who actually have a history of being violent or have shown to be a threat to themselves. There needs to be a better system in place so that the perception of people with mental illnesses are violent or should be feared goes away. This registry can be harmful to people with mental illnesses as we saw in the video Lynette was put on a 5150 hold involuntary and then her and her husband were humiliated by police raiding their house for their guns when Lynette never showed any history of violence or even being a threat to herself. She was voluntary going to the hospital to only stabilize her mood. Lastly, I believe that this registry can take advantage of people with mental illnesses and strip them of their constitutional rights just because they are diagnosed with a mental illness. "
1708,"Given the challenges PWMI have faced as a result of deinstitutionalization, I think that the social exclusion and the phenomenon of ""not in my backyard"" is the most important problem to ""fix."" This is because everyone needs to be included in society and treated with dignity in order to grow as an individual. Overall people should just be treated as human beings. If we all helped one another with basic human needs the barriers and stereotypes of PWMI could go away. Especially the ""us vs them"" mentality is an issue that needs to be resolved as we are all human beings. The stereotypes of PWMI being violent is causing society not to help these individuals and not give them the basic human needs they need to function and thrive within a society. Lastly, and most importantly, this is the problem that should be fixed so that PWMI can be emerged into a community where they can properly recover and restore they lives in order to become successful members of society. "
1709,"Mental illness has been viewed in so many different ways throughout history. Unfortunately, most of these views were negative and many people who had mental illnesses were often treated inhumanely. People with mental illnesses were ultimately thought to be immoral, possessed by evil spirits, or just results of social causes. In the pre-civilization era People with mental illnesses were seen as evil spirits and threats to society which resulted in them being put to death. People also often made holes in their skulls as an effort to treat the mental illness. In the Middle Ages, anywhere between 600,000 and 9 million “outcast” people were tortured and killed by being drowned or burned due to society still believing they were a threat to innocent people and were evil. Finally, however, in the Renaissance era was when humanism came about and when the first hospital of “lunatics” was made to treat these people called “insane.” Then in the Pre-Civil war the first Asylum opened in Virginia in 1773. This was also considered the “era of hospital confinement.” However, these hospitals were poor and people were living in terrible conditions in remote areas away from society, and were not always given the proper funding to have adequate care. Other people in society did not want these hospitals being close to communities causing people with mental illnesses to be basically abandoned by their communities due to everlasting thought of them being “violent and a threat to society.” These different views may suggest that people with mental illnesses should have their own self-determination. Over the past centuries it is seen that people with mental illnesses were killed or put into hospitals involuntarily. It seems as through people of society chose how they would live their lives and choose stereotypes to label them with. I think that from these past views it should suggest to the present and future that people even with mental illnesses should be allowed their own self determination and not only be viewed through societies’ given stereotypes. This goes along with our willingness to consider them full-fledged members of society. The past ways that PWMI have been viewed suggest that we should be allowing  everyone to be full-fledged members of society in order to get the adequate help they need as also mentioned in the Ted Talk we listened to in lecture 1.4. Everyone needs basic human interactions, help from their community to recover, and the option at l"
1710,"Hi Wendy, Great reflection post. I absolutely agree with your ideas here especially about mentally ill people being ostracized in society, and never being fully seen as full fledged members of society just because of a diagnosis. What specifically stood out to me in your post is your mention of PMWI not receiving the same fundamental rights as others just because of the stereotype that they are violent and cause crime. Unfortunately PWMI are used as scapegoats and are often seen as the people in society causing crime when in reality that is not true. Only a small percent of people responsible for crime have a mental illness (3-5%). I think that once this perception goes away then people with mental illnesses will truly be accepted into society and not used as people to blame like they always have been for centuries. We may think that currently people with mental illnesses are being treated better than they were in the past just because they are not being killed and tortured like the they once were. However, people with mental illnesses are being tortured in different ways such as being put in the criminal justice system which is a place they do not belong in. Perhaps we can compare the criminal justice system as the current mental institution ""lunatics"" were put in centuries ago. Ultimately, society just keeps pushing people with mental illnesses away from communities instead of helping them."
1711,"Tamara, I enjoyed reading this post because you are absolutely right here, the main issue is the ""us vs them"" mentality. It has been an issue for centuries and clearly is the barrier of people with mental illnesses getting the right help that the need. I liked what you mentioned about the deinstitutionalization period when mentally ill people were not taught life skills in order to be successful in society, and more importantly people in society were not adequately  informed about people with mental illnesses, and the stereotypes of them being dangerous just kept living on from centuries before. People were not informed about how to help PWMI and continued to create a barrier. As I was reading other posts it made me think if the criminal justice system was just another ""institution"" to place the mentally ill. Lastly, I want to point out your idea that when no one cares about them why should they care about themselves. This is so important! As people we thrive off of relationships with other individuals. We need that connection and help to live our lives as a full fledged members of society. Perhaps if all people with mental illnesses had some type of relationship or compassion instead of people fearing them or just being seen as the enemy they would be able to recover and do well in society. The first step is removing the boundaries and changing our perceptions of PWMI. "
1712,"The stigma around mental illness is very detrimental to people who live with an illness because ultimately it effects people wanting to get help and it also results in isolation within ones society. The president can definitely be an effective person to begin to put an end to the stigma by creating a conversation. The president first of all could speak about the ways in which stigma is detrimental and the ways in which we should be allow everyone to be full-fledged members of society and end isolation or ""us"" vs ""them"" mentality. I think the president should also act to make change within the treatment for mental health and make it more acceptable for people with mental illness to seek help and remind them they are not alone when seeking this help. "
1713,"From my perspective, I think that the movement towards reducing benefits for mental health shows that policymakers do not see mental heath as worthy as overall health care. I think that this view and reduction in benefits is defiantly contributing to the stigma of mental health, and why for a lot of people it is so hard to seek help. I also think that by reducing mental health care it shows people living with mental health illnesses that they are not worthy enough for help or that they should just not get help. Reducing benefits shows people with mental illness that other health illnesses are more important in receiving help then mental health is. "
1714,"Given the service members experiences with medication for mental illness in the military, I would probably recommend mental health treatment centers for active military and veterans. I would recommend a treatment center for military and veterans so they can receive the necessary help in regards to mental illness they can develop being at war (PTSD or depression). I would recommend for this treatment place to be mandatory for all active military and veterans to attend once out of service or after showing signs of a mental illness. I say for this to be mandatory because as we learned, most military men do not seek the help they need due to stigma around mental health. Another thing I would recommend would be free therapy for all active members and veterans, and perhaps even making therapy mandatory to reduce the stigma and make it a normalized thing for people within the military to get help with mental health. "
1715,"Given that PWMI may not even acknowledge that they are ill, society should be allowed to ""step in"" and mandate treatment especially if that person is a true threat to themselves or others. I think that it is important for society to help individuals with mental illness get help but the  right help not just stick them into a jail cell due to believing that they would commit a violent crime or after committing a crime knowing they suffer with a mental illness. An example that would be acceptable would be if a guy was hearing voices to harm himself and suffered from paranoia that the hospital is working with the voices to harm him. That guy may be less willing to get the necessary treatment and medication to help get him mentally stable. By society getting people with mental health illnesses treatment when needed would be a good thing. Instead of throwing people in jail where they would not get the right help or just ignoring people with mental illnesses all together is so much harmful. It shouldn't be ""us vs them"" but how can we help and better each other. "
1716," Given the various forms of stigma related to people with mental illness teachings and circular should contain healthy conversations and information about mental health to combat stigma. It is important to teach students at all ages (especially young children) what mental health is.  It is also important to teach students at a young age the resources that are available for them in case they are feeling for example, depressed, anxious, or even after going through traumatic events.  In elementary school I think it would be important for teachers to contain fun activities about mental health to keep them engaged and to keep it easy for them to understand. I once saw online that a teacher who had her students check in every day before class about how they were feeling. The students would write their names on the back of a sticky note and place it under a category as I’m great, I’m okay, I’m meh, I’m struggling, I’m having a tough time and wouldn’t mind a check in, or I’m not doing great. This way the students can see how many other students may be feeling the same way as them, and also created a way for the teacher to understand how her students were doing and could check in to provide support. I thought this was a great way to have younger aged children be aware of their feeling and allow them to understand they are not the only ones that may be having a tough time. It also normalizes seeking help at a young age.  In middle school I think that teachers could do the same thing but also in health education classes mental health should be a regular topic that is brought up and taught. In middle school bullying becomes common and self esteem issues may arise so it is important for students to want to seek support. If teachers continued to include learning activities about mental health then this would create a safe environment for students to skeet help.  Lastly, in high school is where it is so important to combat mental health stigmas. There are three ways I think could be the best way for teachers and schools to do this. First would be for outside speakers and experts to talk about their experiences with mental health. Secondly, to have teens practice mindfulness exercises. This can include taking a minute before and after class to sit in silence and reflect on how they are feeling through breathing techniq"
1717,"Denise, Great ideas and I completely agree! For your idea regarding elementary students being read a book or some type of simplistic activity would definitely be the best! I also like how you included this should be done by a professional in the field for questions to be answered by them regarding mental health. This could even be by maybe the counselor of the school so if students do seek support it would be with a familiar face. I remember being in school and not knowing even what the therapist looked like. Maybe if they got more involved with the students personally in the classroom then students would be more willing to go them for help! I also like your ideas for middle and high school a speaker would be great but I also think that schools should include more of smaller environment teaching techniques for students that age so it feels more personal. This can include projects in the classroom or even one one one check ins with their teachers."
1718,"Danielle, First I want to mention I have never thought about the idea for middle and high schoolers to have a criminal justice class to learn about their rights and the criminal justice process but that is an awesome idea! Regarding reducing mental health stigma in schools I like how you mention that schools should bring in outside speakers to talk about mental health but also having groups to individualize the information. I think having smaller groups and having a dialogue is so important for students to feel more comfortable with their peers but also the staff in school perhaps the teacher or counselor/therapist at the school. I remember in school when we had school presenters it is so easy for students to not pay attention or be disengaged. I also think the smaller working groups would allow the students to not feel so isolated great point!"
1719,"The concepts of specificity and sensitivity can apply to decisions about civil commitment when an individual is deemed dangerous or not and possibly civilly committed. We learned that civil commitment is based on prediction of an individuals behavior rather than behaviors that they have already done. Therefore, these terms can apply to these predictions either being true negative/positive or false negative/positive. Sensitivity would be the people who are dangerous and were predicted to be dangerous and were civilly committed. Specificity would be the people who were not protected to be dangerous and are not committed. False positives would represent individuals who are predicted to be dangerous but are not actually dangerous. This would put that individual at risk to be civilly committed when they do not need to be. On the other hand false negatives would be if an individual is found not dangerous but actually is. This would put the society at risk instead of only the individual. "
1720,"In my personal opinion involuntary commitment of sex offenders after they complete their sentence depends on each individual but in general is probably a good idea. I went back and forth on this question because I think that it would be a good idea for sec offenders to go through therapy in a treatment center to go through therapy they probably did not receive when in jail. However, after watching the due process video it shoes just how crowded these centers are and how people only het around 3 hours of therapy a week due to shortness of staff. My main focus in saying that involuntary commitment being a good idea would be to get offenders therapy and focusing on getting them help and restoring their lives to be healthy functioning members of society. On the other hand, however, I could see how it could be a bad idea due to people being wrongly convicted and then making them serve even more time after their sentence.  In my opinion I think it would be best for it to be determined on a case to case basis. That way, it will reduce the amount of overcrowded facilities so that people could get the necessary amount of therapy. By doing this as well can determine who still needs intensive therapy and who do not. This can also depend on the crimes that individuals were committed for. There are a lot of factors that should go into determining whether a person should be involuntary committed.  "
1721," I would consider inpatient commitment to be the larger reach of state authority into an individual's liberty. This is because in outpatient commitment people still have the ability to live their lives outside of the facility where as in inpatient they are not able to leave. I would also consider inpatient commitment to be the larger reach because people within society can recommend you go to treatment and after going before a judge they can commit you into a place where you are basically locked up and can not leave. There are procedures that have to be done to get an individual committed and I think by this being allowed on the behalf of someone is definitely a larger reach into an individual’s liberty. Lastly, I think that by mental health providers being the ones to deem a person to be civilly committed based on one interview or evaluation alone is not enough unless the individual is actively trying to hurt themselves or others and have already shown to be violent or a threat. Liberty means the ability for an individual to basically live their life how they want to and that is taken away once someone else chooses for them to be committed into a facility where they are not able to leave."
1722,"There are many pros and cons to both inpatient and outpatient involuntary commitment. Some pros of inpatient commitment are that it is an attempt to prevent self harm, protect society, relieve families from providing care, and the it overall provides care and treatment to the individual. However, some cons or controversies are that it is coercive, anti therapeutic, stigmatizing, and discriminatory. On the other hand there is outpatient therapy. Some pros of outpatient commitment are that individuals get to continue to live their lives and gives support for using commitment. Some cons or criticisms are that tragedy drives policy, statues are unconstitutional, it can be coercive, and stigmatizing. I think that each can work in different ways to measure success not only for the individual but also society as a whole.  First, I will reflect on inpatient commitment and the measures of success for this type of treatment for the individual. First and most importantly I think that to have success in this type of treatment there  needs to be enough staff and no overcrowding of patients. I think this would be most important so that each individual gets the necessary treatment and therapy needed while committed. This would be success for the individual but also society. This would be success for society because patients who are committed would be receiving adequate care to learn how to be functioning members of society and take the necessary steps to get their lives back on track. I also think that the appropriate measure of success would be not having a high turnover rate. When the same individual comes back time and time again obviously something is not working and level of care needs to be changed. Next, is outpatient commitment. This type of commitment is very different solely based on the reason that individuals are not in the facility 24/7. I do think that the appropriate measures of success are very similar to inpatient in making sure there is enough staff to handle each client with adequate care. However, one different measure of success I think could be a low rate of people having to be transitioned into inpatient. I think this measures success of outpatient commitment because it shows that individuals can be cared for without having to go into a ""lock down"" facility"" and they are able to restore their lives while still living in it. I currently work at an inpatient rehab for teens and see very often especially with those who have"
1723,The stage of the criminal process described in the video that would probably seem the most difficult for PWMI to navigate would be adjudication stage specifically the arraignment and/or plea bargaining. I think that this stage would be the most difficult for PWMI to navigate because they might not fully understand the information being given to them. I personally find it very confusing due to the language that is used. It could be difficult for PWMI to even understand their own rights and the evidence against them. Perhaps they were mentally unstable when this crime was committed or even during the arrangement process. Plea bargaining could be especially difficult because again they may not understand the criminal justice process and might not understand the best option to choose. They could also be coerced into choosing a guilty plea when they are actually innocent just to end the case. It is especially important for PWMI to have a lawyer present during these steps to ensure they understand what is going on at all times or at least have someone on their side who knows what is going on. 
1724,"With the recent changes in California corrections to shift responsibilities for large numbers of felons from the state to local jurisdictions there are definitely some challenges. Some challenges that might occur are the less availability of staff for mental heath treatment due to low staff to inmate ratios. Also, due to budgeting and the jail not having enough money to provide mental health treatment is another huge challenge. In the video the prison guard states how may mental health inmates are off their meds and not mentally stable. This is a huge challenge for PWMI who need health care individually instead of in a place that is too overcrowded and aren't cared for appropriately. Budgeting creates the most challenges due to the lack of mental health treatment facilities PWMI should be sent to instead of going to jail. Lastly, putting them in the ""padded cells"" could result in their mental health declining even more. I could not think of many benefits that may arise from this change however perhaps the fact that because it is so overcrowded they may have to release some inmates early. This could be beneficial if they decide to release PWMI into a mental health facility for them to get the treatment and medications they need. This could also benefit PWMI who are in jail for misdeamener crimes or were seen as ""a threat"" or ""violent"" due to their mental illnesses. "
1725,"I have mixed feeling while answering this question. I want to say that I think that it is fair for the police to serve as first responders to situations involving PWMI for the police. I think they signed up to protect the community and are the ""crime fighter"" however they are the individuals people call when they are in trouble or need help. This should not only include when a crime is occurring but also when individuals are in crises within themselves and need help. However, it is not fair to put this on police officers without extensive training on how to deal with these situations. I work at a mental health rehabilitation facility and I know first hand how challenging mental health crises can be to deal with and I can only imagine the even more challenging situations police are in. They should have to take trainings in order for this to be fair to have them be first responders. Because of the lack of training I definitely do not think it is fair on PWMI for police officers to be the first responders when they do not know how to handle mental health issues. It puts them at severe risk for being locked up or even being killed as the video talks about the women with schizophrenia who was shot and killed. These individuals need help and should not have to worry about their life due to untrained police officers. On both ends without the proper training it is unfair to have police officers be the first responders to situations involving PWMI. "
1726,"CIT and stigma relate because CIT  is working to reduce the stigmas around mental health with police officers. The most common misconception by police officers regarding PWMI is that they are violent people or incapable of reasoning with. However this crisis intervention training is definitely a step in the right direction to reducing these ideas. The trainings allow police offers to learn how to de escalate people in crises. This is beneficial in reducing the stigma that people in crises are ""crazy, unmanageable, or not able to think reasonably."" This is one of the major issues regarding police and PWMI interactions, police offers do not understand what is going on in PWMI's head. CIT also works to reduce the stigma that PWMI are violent individuals. Again with the de escalation techniques police are trained how to empathize with people and see that the majority of people do not mean harm they just want help or evens someone to just talk to as we seen in the video during the lecture. "
1727,"Suz,  I really enjoyed reading your post. I like how you mentioned that inpatient commitment can cause someone to have a fear of the mental health system and cause built up resentment likely causing them to not seek out treatment when need. I thought this was such an interesting idea! This can definitely be true and maybe some people will fear that if they do seek help they will be put back into an inpatient facility against their will. Also I agree with you that in order to have success people really need to cope and be accepting of the program. At my job (an inpatient rehab for teens) we definitely see the most success when they are either willing to come to treatment or when the clients finally accept where they are and accept the change in their lives. "
1728,"Steve, Great post! I did not think about measuring the success through case workers following up with patients, and I think this is a great idea. I more talked about how the program individually could become more successful by making sure there is adequate amount of staff members, and measuring the rate of turnover such as how may times people come back to these treatment places in order to measure the success of each. I really do like the idea of having case workers follow through with the client in order to see how they are doing following treatment because it would allow an accurate judgement of on the effectiveness and if the individual actually got better after treatment. I also think that it would be interesting to see how OP and IP treatment differ in success especially if someone attended both treatment levels. Unfortunately, like you mentioned there definitely is not enough case workers to be able to do this. Like mental health workers there is such a shortage of professionals that are needed in the field."
1729,"Taheri’s findings were first, unable to determine if CIT reduces injury towards police during encounters with PWMI, and second that CIT has shown no effect on outcomes on arrest or force being used by the officer. I would personally recommend to continuing using the CIT model for people with mental illness. Although this study did not find much effectiveness there were still many limitations outlined in the article. Some of these limitations were self report from the officers which could have been skewed by officers underreporting to sound better. Another limitation was the fact that officers have to volunteer for the training. Therefore there is already a skew in the police officers being used in the study because they are already attempting at creating better encounters with people with mental illness. As I mentioned I would highly recommend to continue using CIT, and I would not make it optional for officers. This is definitely a training that should be required for all officers in order to better serve people with mental illnesses. Then I’m sure the study would be able to find some effectiveness (or not) with CIT. CIT is very important in my opinion and I think it is a great starting idea to finally get officers training to save lives and make encounters safer for not only people with mental illnesses but for police officers as well. As this training continues to be used I think that more hours should be implemented if effectiveness is shown. Each encounter with people with mental illnesses is different so the more amount of training the better. Also, perhaps trained professionals should accompany the police offers on at least one or two of these encounters to help the officers if they become unsure or if the encounter starts to go south. This way they can see what to techniques to add in specific trainings. My last suggest would be for the trained professionals to try different demonstration or training techniques to attempt to get the effectiveness in CIT higher. Since this is still a new training it is not perfect and it should be treated as trial and error."
1730,"Sayla, I had very similar ideas as you. I too believe that CIT should absolutely be continued. As it is still new and there were many limitations found in the study alone perhaps if a few things were changed then studies could find the effectiveness in the training. Even if this study did not find significant effectiveness in CIT I still think that it is better than no training at all. Perhaps with more requires hours or use of different training techniques could make this more effective. I also pointed out like you mentioned the fact that police officers have to volunteer for the training. I actually did not know this and was a bit surprised. This training should definitely be mandatory for all officers. You did a great job at bringing in points from the article to back up your ideas. Overall great post!"
1731,"Asia, I agree with you that CIT should be continued to be used. I really like how you mentioned that there was an increase in PWMI being brought to mental health organizations in the community instead of being arrested. This alone is such a big accomplishment! However I do think that the training should be more than 40 hours but this is a start and overall definitely better than having no hours. I also agree with your point that future studies should get more samples, perhaps all around the country where this training is used to see if a different state does something better within the training than another state.  Of course, this is still a relatively new training so it will definitely take time finding out what will work and what does not. This is also why the study could have found no significant effectiveness in reducing injury towards police during encounters with PWMI, and no effect on outcomes on arrest or force being used by the officer. Lastly, I think it would definitely be interesting to see how trained officers and non trained officers differ in encounters with people with mental illness. Thanks for sharing your idea I enjoyed reading this post! "
1732,"I think for everyone being arrested over 100 times would be traumatic and exhausting to go through. For people with mental illnesses especially these feelings are probably intensified. Also after being arrested that many times I think this can cause paranoia in some individuals with mental illness and cause fear of being arrested at any time. The paranoia is probably constantly thinking they are being watched or someone is coming to arrest them. It must also be confusing for them, and probably will make them worse. As this video mentions, people with mental illnesses are locked up for a long period of times and it makes them worse due to not receiving the adequate care they need in order to get better. Lastly, due to being arrested so many times and not receiving the right treatment I think that this could leave individuals hopeless to finding that help."
1733,"Given that medication costs consume large percentages of jail budgets, I think that this is the most common form of treatment because of jails being so understaffed. Due to being understaffed jails are unable to provide one on one treatment with a therapist. Along with this I believe there is a small amount of jails that actually provide training programs to staff members to assist inmates in crisis intervention and overall treatment. Therefore, just like everywhere in today's society medications are treated as a ""go to quick fix."" Many people think that mediations will fix individuals problems quickly instead of talking about issues with a professional. Perhaps if these budgets related to medication costs were invested in hiring more therapeutic staff this would benefits inmates a lot more and could reduce the amounts of suicide and get people with mental illnesses into the right treatment facility. Lastly, I had a thought that this could be used as the most common form of treatment because medication is something that is consistent before  and after being in jail. As we learned from this lecture discharge planning is the used the least amount of times and since there is very limited amount of therapeutic services offered in jails perhaps they want to make sure that medications inmates take in jail are used after they are released to maintain stability in mental health. If medications are changed or not regulated this could make their release even worse on top of the lack of discharge planning. To conclude, the use of medication is probably the most common form of treatment because of the easy availability, lack of overall treatment staff, and stability of medications before and after one is incarcerated. "
1734,"I was on the fence about this question. One side of me believes that these rights are enough and inmates lost these rights then they committed crimes. However, inmates are still people at the end of the day and jails are usually short term sentences. I ultimately decided I think that inmates are given too few of rights. Based off the video we watched within the lecture, inmates are given the rights to freedom, religion, and expression. However, these freedoms can be restricted. One reason they can be restricted is due to it being ""harmful."" I can understand how freedom of expression could be harmful if an inmate becomes violent to themselves or others however I don't think that inmates should be restricted on their speech of religion. During the rest of the lecture video we learned that inmates have the right to treatment and the right to refuse treatment. Although these are very important rights for inmate to have I still think they should be given other rights such as maybe the right to privacy and the right to not undergo any corporal punishment. I do understand as well that these individuals committed crimes that could be violent and some people believe ""they deserve to have no rights"" but they are still human beings who should be given human rights. Some other rights inmates should have are the right to receive heath-care and even basic needs such as food, water, and shelter, and again their rights that they do have should not be restricted. "
1735,"Three indicators that I feel jails should measure about mental illnesses are excessive mood swings, having suicidal thoughts, and even a history of mental illnesses in their past as well as in their family. Knowing the signs of mental illnesses is very important especially in jails because the suicide rate is very high. It is also important to know when an individual has a mental illness so staff could possibly get them the right help while incarcerated. Although this does not happen often it is important to know if help does show up. Excessive mood swings are important because it could be a sign of depression or even bipolar disorder. Suicidal ideation is important for jails to measure for the obvious reason so an inmate does not harm themselves but it could also be important in terms of supervision and how often these inmates should be watched. Lastly, mental health history in the individual and family can be beneficial in terms of understanding what an inmate has had or could be at risk of developing. This could be depression, anxiety, or even bipolar disorder as well. Perhaps if these indicators were commonly measured staff could could help inmates and this could lower the suicide rate. However, the government could also see the alarming amount of mental illnesses people have and how it is affected negatively while being ini jails. This way, these measures could begin to change where PWMI end up after being arrested."
1736,"The use of jails for the seriously mentally ill is definitely inappropriate in my opinion given the funding, architectural, and operational constraints. As we learned throughout this course so far, people with mental illnesses do not belong in jail and can be worse for them one example is because of them not receiving adequate care while being incarcerated. Also, as we learned this week in lesson 5.1 video having people with mental illness in jails even as it is short term can cause more problems for them because of the heterogeneous population, how chaotic jails can get because of it being short term, and lastly because of most jails being understaffed as well as having low budgets. Due to the funding constraint of jails mental health professionals would not be readily available for people with mental health and due to low budgets as we learned in last week’s module there is not much training regarding crises people with mental health illnesses could go through. Because of the architectural and operational constraints jails are not big enough to hold as many people as they have. This can cause stress for people with mental illnesses. Also, just as a mention due to people with mental illnesses being such a high percentage of people in jails they could be taking spots for criminals who should be placed there, and mentally ill people should be in hospitals or rehabilitation centers.  Recalling the realignment policy change we learned about in week four I think that the experience of PWMI in California jails is affected by this justice change because more people were being brought into local jails due to the realignment separating non serious or non violent crimes to be handled by the local level instead of state prisons this caused jails to become more overcrowded."
1737,"Liisa, I agree and also believe that jails are most definitely not the place for PWMI as they are not properly staffed or equipped to handle mentally ill people. I like how you mentioned about the lack of discharge planning playing a big role in the rate of reoffending or rearrested. This shows that the criminal justice system is not the right place for especially mentally ill as they should be planning for rehabilitation after being incarcerated so this number of rearrest goes down.  Also, your example of the Ohio study determining the rate of homelessness and police encounters after incarceration was very interesting. Perhaps this is another example of the criminal justice system failing mentally ill people which supports the fact that jails are used inappropriately for the mentally ill. "
1738,"Asia, Great post! It very much is unethical to deprive PWMI resources to help them both mentally and psychically. It is mind boggling learning about what people with mental illnesses go through in jails because we have the data that shows how detrimental jails are for them, and we  know how overcrowded and under budgeted they are so why has state government and individual counties not figured out an alternative solution to this. It is sad like you mentioned jails are the modern day ""insane asylums."" Jails are definitely used inappropriately as a temporary fix to getting mentally ill people off the street but then releasing them from jail even worse than they were before. I thought it was very powerful for you to add the quote from the Cook County Jail sheriff saying that the mentally ill is ""a population people do not care about.""This is so sad and unfair to treat people like this perhaps if the stigma of mental illness was eliminated people will start caring and understanding that people with mental illness need professional psychological interventions and can be restored back into society. They do not belong in jails where they are treated extremely poorly."
1739,"I think that I would prefer being in a mental health court instead of a traditional court proceeding if I was a participant. I would prefer this court processing because it would allow me to get the necessary treatment. This court processing focuses on treatment rather than punishment which I believe is the best way in reducing recidivism. We should be helping individuals restore their lives instead of putting mentally ill individuals in cells that worsen their mental health. Also, these mental health courts will be allowing people to get help that they probably did not have access too before."
1740,I think that probation is set up well to address supervision and treatment of PWMI. Like stated in the video jail is not set up to change behaviors where as probation is. PWMI will meet with individuals to help change their life for the better and get them services that they need including perhaps therapy to help especially with their mental health issues and hold PWMI accountable for going to these services. Compared to jail probation is definitely better in regards to supervision and treatment because the treatment services are not available in jail as they would be being out in the community on probation.
1741,"I think that mental health professionals would be mildly receptive to the RNR approach with PWMI in the justice system. I would say mildly receptive because this approach does need more research in applying it to people with mental illnesses. However, this is a good start to a new model focusing on PWMI within the criminal justice system. Other factors besides recidivism that they would be concerned with for PWMI under supervision is the community could be the use of treatment from therapy or institutions ad measuring how this is positively effecting individuals lives."
1742,"Given the widespread acceptance of RNR, but with the caution by Skeem et al. (2015) I would give a Chief Probation Officer a few guidance points about supervision of MI on probation. The first point of guidance would be to monitor substance abuse and get individuals treatment for that. As Skeem mentions in this article this is one of the risk factors for crime and a reason to avoid services that are focused mainly on general risk factors. Supervising substance abuse can greatly reduce violence and recidivism in people with mental illnesses because substance abuse great effects people with mental illnesses violent behavior. However, this is not to say that  all mentally ill people are violent but the substances can enhance the behavior. Another point of guidance I would give to a chief probation officer would be that the RNR model still needs a lot of studies completed to prove the need principle for PWMI. There should be many more accurate results of the RNR model being effective for PWMI before being widely used. This should include reponsivity studies as well. The last piece of guidance I would give a chief probation officer about supervision of MI on probation would be that people with mental illnesses are likely to not be able to understand all the criminal justice terms used within their probation. I think that it is important to have a probation officer who specialized in mental health and also be someone trained in mental health crises if an individual does have a crisis while being supervised. This could also include knowing that an environment like jail is more detrimental to people with mental illnesses."
1743,"I do not think that it is fair to use risk assessment tools when they are not 100% accurate because what if a person is found violent if they are not. If an individual is put in jail or their life is effected in a negative way when they do not deserve it is not acceptable. I think that risk assessment tools can sometimes not detect change that individuals have shown while either in prison or probation. Therefore, I don't think a tool should be used and instead their actions or changed behaviors should be looked at (if they were complying to change or not). Unless this tool is completely accurate it should not be used because people's lives are at stake."
1744,"Suz, Great ideas within this post! I especially liked that you mentioned how cognitive behavioral therapy needs to be incorporated within their supervision of someone with a mental illness. You mentioned how risk factors can be the same for people with and without mental illnesses and that is very important to note because all though the risk factors may be the same the way to reduce these factors and reduce recidivism is going to be different with these two groups of people. Therefore since we have evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy works that is what should be implemented in PWMI probation, and of course like you mentioned should be monitored when the individual is attending to make sure they are going to sessions. Overall, do you think the RNR model is more beneficial?"
1745,"Nicolle, Great post! I agree also that the RNR model should definitely be given a chance to see how well it works despite the lack of studies that have been done so far. I think the idea of treating the risk factors that are the cause of violent behavior first is a great starting place to reduce recidivism in mentally ill individuals. Like you mentioned, most of these crimes are misdemeanor crimes and even though for small crimes PWMI are placed in jail perhaps because officers do not know what else to do with them. i like how you mentioned this model can be used for anyone not just people with mental illness! This is very true due to it being so individualized. Perhaps a study that would be beneficial is measuring the overall recidivism rate for people with mental illness and without and see how this model effects each group. "
1746,"The prison environment might aggravate the condition or persons with mental illness because of the use of ""segregation"" or when they are put in isolation. This will definitely make individuals mental health worse and make PWMI suffer more trauma. Another example of the environment aggravating people with mental illnesses is because of staff not adequately trained to deal with PWMI."
1747,"From the discussion in the video I do think that it is possible to truly rehabilitate prisoners with mental illnesses if they are given the correct care and help. To start, we learned that some prisoners do have their own mental health unit inside the jail but not all of them do, and I think that is the starting point of rehabilitation. The general population prison is not where PWMI should be held for various reasons as we learned in previous weeks. I also think it is important for jails not to focus on punishment as a lot of them do but focus mainly on rehabilitation. Following this, another way to truly rehabilitate prisoners with mental illnesses would be to provide them with the right treatment with therapists and also get them on the correct medication. One prisoner in the video stated he began to take one medication, and never felt better in his life. Although of course it is not feasible for someone to check in with a mentally ill individual to make sure they are taking their medications, that person needs to take accountability to take them and should  want to continue to better themselves. Lastly, the way we can truly rehabilitate not only people with mental illnesses but all of the prion population would be to help them with a plan when they renter society. Provide classes and resources to allow prisoners to learn to be successful members of society. This can be done by taking classes about how to act in certain situations while in society (ex. anger management classes) or even just help them get jobs and set up housing where they can live and work once they are released. This can ease their way back in, lower the risk of reoffending, and rehabilitate prisoners with mental illnesses. "
1748,"I think that there are definitely more disadvantages than the advantages and although this is a way to maintain order this is not the  only way, and I would consider the worst way because it is very detrimental to people's mental health and well being. As the video mentions, human interaction is a necessity for the human brain to grow. Without this interaction the brain can be considered as ""frozen"" and can start to play tricks on the person. It was also very hard for the individual narrating his story to be able to interact with people once being let out. Solitary can lead to worse mental health issues which is why I would say that there is much more disadvantages to the inmate that outweigh the advantages of being able to control order in the prison."
1749,"I have mixed feelings about my tax dollars being spent on treating the mentally ill inmates. Half of me is not okay with it because as stated in the video, we should be focusing on outside of prison treatment that could have avoided them being in prison, and what is much more cheaper than housing them in jail. Also, the state should be budgeting better and using more money of its own to be treating people with mental illnesses since the state is deciding to send so many individuals to jail where most of them do not belong. However, the other part of me is ok with knowing that my tax dollars are benefiting people with mental illnesses who are misrepresented and have not been given the adequate care in the past. I think for me it is more ok if I know that absolutely what we as a society are giving are money to is actually benefiting inmates with mental illness and allowing them to receive the proper care while in prison as they deserve to be receiving. "
1750," There are definitely ways that prisons can best meet the need to keep inmates and staff while still providing the needed treatment for PWMI, and still contain costs. The first way prisons can do this is by creating separate areas for PWMI within the jails. We have seen this starting in some prisons from the videos we have watched within the lectures, and this way the prisoners with mental illnesses can be provided the needed treatment away from other inmates that may cause them distress. Also, in these areas there should be designated and trained staff to handle these inmates. We saw in one video that we watched from the lectures of a new position in the mental health until which is a psychologist being placed in the unit to help these inmates. This will also allow for their needed treatment. Overall, having these separate units will definitely keep clients safe as well as staff members safe especially the ones who are not trained properly on handling mentally ill inmates and not being able to differentiate between them being non compliant versus having a crisis. A way that prisons can provided the needed treatment for PWMI while at the same time still containing costs would be to perhaps focus on the accurate medications for the inmates. An article by, Daniel, 2007, mentioned that medications decrease the costs of healthcares because by having the correct medication it lowers the amount of hospitalizations as well as admissions/travel expenses getting inmates to the hospitals.  I think that inmates with mental illness and other inmates without a mental illness should receive the same resources. I don’t think that one group should receive more than the other. Although inmates with mental illnesses appear to need more resources such as more therapy, we have learned that inmates who do not have a mental illness before going to prison can still develop one while they are incarcerated. They can experience depression and anxiety once they are first incarcerated and can experience theses symptoms again once they come close to their release date and worry about integrating back into society. Especially if an inmate is sent to isolation this can be very detrimental to mental health and the resources should be there for them as they would for inmates who came into prison mentally ill. I also believe that there should be allocated staff for both groups. Inmates without a mental disorder can be"
1751,"Vivianna, I like how you mentioned that adequate intake screening is the important first step at maintaining safety. This is very true because hopefully if prison staff realize an incoming inmates illness is too severe they can put them into a facility for better treatments. It is also so important that they are using the right screening tools as you mentioned. Next, your idea about the guards main thinking of punishment over rehabilitation is a very good point. How can someone recover and get better in a place that is all about punishment. After being punished for so long we can't expect these inmates to be able to integrate back into society as a mentally healthy individual, and this is not keeping them safe or giving them the needed treatment. Lastly, thank you for including information on the Norwegian prisons. That is so interesting and great that they have designed a program for officers to work one on one with the inmates! I agree with you that officers that are assigned to work in prisons should be evaluated and trained extensively to focus on motivating and helping them get better enough to re enter society. I think it would just be hard in the U.S due to the unfortunate low staffing problem going on currently. Overall great post and great job adding in other resources and mentioning other countries to compare to our system I found it very interesting."
1752,"Caroline, I think you brought up a great idea to have prisons screen patients very throughly first and then group them based on their behaviors. I think it would also be a good idea safety wise and cost efficiently wise not to hold inmates with mental illness in prisons but instead in hospitals. This would definitely save money in regards to needing more staff and also with medications and in case these inmates need to be sent to the hospital. There should be a hospital for PWMI to go when arrested instead of being in jail. The only point I would disagree with in this post would be your idea of mental health inmates being given more resources. I do understand you're reasoning and especially since they need more hands on and one to one care they should be receiving more resources than what they have currently. However, I do not think this means that inmates without mental illness should not receive more resources. Overall, I just think all inmates should be given the same resources as inmates who come into jail without a mental illness could develop ones the time got on and because of their experiences while being incarcerated. But I do agree with you that inmates should definitely be screened throughout before they are entered into a system, and need more of a rehabilitation place and prison is probably not the best place for that. Overall, you brought up great ideas and I enjoyed reading your post!"
1753,"Reflecting on this video, if I was a taxpayer in Missouri, I wouldn't mind the new construction of the new Fulton State Hospital. Due to this new construction allowing patients to get the necessary help they need I would feel okay with the state using my tax money to do this. Older state hospitals did not have the right amount of funding or layout to make it well functioning to patients and also the poor working conditions is what made these facilities fail overall. I think it is totally necessary for the state to focus on the important issue of mental health illness and build a facility like this."
1754,"I do not think that the Not guilty by Reason of insanity is necessarily a ""Get out of jail free card."" I think that some people are definitely not compentent to stand a trial due to not understanding the process and suffering too serious of a mental illness to be able to go through with a trial. Also, just because a person is found not guilty by reason of insanity does not mean that they are not suffering as they perhaps would if they were sent to jail. They are still incarcerated awaiting a judge allowing them to be released if they ever do, and they are placed in a mental facility for however long their sentence is working to be rehabilitated. It is not like they are sent home because they are found to be ""insane."" Therefore, I do not think this is basically  a way to get out of jail."
1755,"I think that state hospitals can best deal with patient and staff safely while providing treatment would be to have an adequate amount of staff who are properly trained to handle mental health situations. This way patients are receiving care from trained professionals when they are in a crisis or distress. Also, having enough staff/security will allow staff members to be safe when dealing with these types of situations. "
1756,"This process was very interesting to learn about through this video. Overall, I think that this is a great idea for treating depression if it will truly help people who have a difficult time overcoming and dealing with depression, and as this video mentions there have been many success stories from this. It is also so fascinating to me that doctors have been able to discover this area of the brain and come up with a way to in a way ""turn off depression."" After watching the brain surgery happen and seeing that her mood changed almost immediately was amazing and we saw how well this helped her emotions and overall life. Due to this deep brain stimulation being successful for many people so far I feel confident about the use of this as a treatment for depression. "
1757,"I think that state hospitals should play a big part within the criminal justice system as it is very appropriate to do so. As we learned in the lecture videos this week, state hospitals today work directly with the police and are attempting to replace the facilities that were used before these newer state hospitals. I believe that the role of these state hospitals should be an alternative rehabilitation place for people with mental illnesses who get involved in the criminal justice system instead of going to jail. At these state hospitals, these offenders with mental illnesses will get the care they need that they would not receive while in prison. We also learned in the lecture that schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder are among the most common disorders along with major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder that are treated in state hospitals.   I do think that state hospitals should be used almost exclusively for forensic patients. It is already like this now as we learned 90% of patients are forensic patients such as people who are found incompetent to stand trial, not guilty by reason of insanity, and SVP offenders who are civilly committed for sex offenders. The other 10% of patients are civilly committed patients who could be a danger to themselves/others, and can be renewed annually for their release. Overall, I think this is the appropriate targeted population that state hospitals should be focused on because it is hard for people in the criminal justice, and all forensic patients to get help. Especially patines who are civilly committed it is hard to find a bed that is open and some people spend their entire stay in the ER. There should be more focus on opening more beds for commitments as well as more beds and more facilities to help individuals who would otherwise go into a prison and get worse in regards to their mental health. A large amount of people in jails do suffer from mental illness, therefore this is why state hospitals should predominately focus on forensic patients to have enough beds for these inmates.  "
1758,"Viviana, Great post! You mention great points about how state hospitals would be a much more appropriate place for people with mental illnesses to go in order to receive care. I did not even think about confidentiality and how it is not respected in prison so that was definitely a great point to bring up. Overall, the care is very much lacking in prison and inmates with mental health illnesses should be placed in a hospital. Therefore, these hospitals sould definitely play a big role in regards to the criminal justice system. I also really liked how you mentioned that state hospitals give care with  after they are released from the hospital. This is so important as well with the rates of recidivism and just in general with giving people the needed care. If people do not receive a treatment plan for after the time in the hospital cold be for nothing. They need support financially, emotionally and even socially. "
1759,"Briana, You did a great job highlighting the problems with state hospitals which is very important to remember. As for myself I think I was quick to point out how state hospitals would be a better alternative to jail just because they would not be in jail settings, and would be in the hands of proper care and receive the treatment they need. However, it definitely is important to remember how hospitals are structured and the lack of staff they have. I definitely agree with you that they should be rebuilt and put in less isolated places. Also, I went a different way with the population it should serve. I stated that these hospitals should house majority of forensic patients, however, I enjoyed reading your different viewpoint on this. I agree with you that the hospitals should not focus solely on PWMI who are already in the criminal justice system but all PWMI. This can ultimately help people at risk of being involved in the system and can help them before they commit a crime. Overall, I think that these hospitals should expand in order to help as many PWMI as possible in and out of the criminal justice system. Great post!"
1760,I think that the described forms of data sharing does seem satisfactory in my opinion for really understanding the link between CJ and MH systems and their clients. Having mental health agencies come and look for clients they know would fit their program might be beneficial since people in the CJ system can not look for resources while incarcerated. I also think it seems satisfactory because the client information is being shared with another company looking to help them instead of as the video stated if shared with the police the information could be used for something else. A way I think this could be done to improve it wold be for the mental health staff to conduct interviews with people to really understand them and understand what types of treatment they need. 
1761,"The CIT trained approach appears a lot different from a routine law enforcement encounter in my opinion. I think the biggest difference is the fact that the officers really take the time to empathize and understand what the person is going through. Although of course not all routine police encounters do the officers not take the time to do this but for the most part I think officers do not know how to do this as they are not trained and this causes the individual to become more stressed out. Also, by taking the time to get the individual and family help almost immediately by using the can help resource was a great idea. "
1762,I think that it often takes a court order or other legal actions for departments of corrections to change the way PWMI are treated because of how understaffed the department of corrections is. I think that maybe because of it being understaffed the way PWMI are treated fall through the cracks. This could also take a court order to change the way PWMI are treated because workers in the department of corrections do not fully understand how to deal with PWMI due to lack of training.
1763,Some challenges I believe that the mental health workers might deal with in the correctional environment is the fact that prison staff are very hard and tough on them which results in prisoners not understanding or grasping of someone who want to help them. I think another challenge might be he high population of inmates with mental illness and making sure enough clinical staff is available to help. I think that cross training with correctional agencies/staff would help because it would get all the staff from different departments on the same page to better serve all of the inmates. Also each department could teach each other different strategies to handling different situations. 
1764," I feel that the Crisis Intervention Training is the essential training for mental health and criminal justice actors to benefit people with mental illnesses. First of all as mentioned in the article by Watson & Fulambarker,  the crisis intervention training has been named ""the most well known model of collaboration to improve police response to mental health crisis"" arguably. Most importantly, I think that this is the essential training because it is very beneficial in teaching officers how to handle mental health crises, allowing for both parties to be safe in these encounters, and works to help people with mental illnesses not get involved in the criminal justice system. This is so important because of the alarming number of PWMI being put into prison and not getting actual help. Police interactions without any training is likely to lead to violence and one or both of the parties involved being at risk for their safety. The crisis intervention training is a 40 hour training class given to police officers for them to learn how to empathize as well as talk with people who are having a mental health crisis. This allows for the person having a crisis to trust the officer and be more willing to comply. A lot of times these people really just want someone to talk to and someone to understand what they are going through. This training helps with this significantly. Even the 10 hour training by NAMI that was analyzed in the article by Parker showed significant decreases in use of force by the police officers and battery by bodily waste. With this reduction from a 10 hour class a 40 hour training could make these instances go down even more. However, although I think that this training is most essential to mental health and criminal justice system I think that the training does need to be longer and require more hours and more frequent. Some officers may not experience a crisis for sometime and could forget how to handle the situation. Even for an officer that does experience this situations a refresher is always necessary and useful. This would make this training even better and even more essential. "
1765,"Serenity, I enjoyed reading your post as you brought up great points for actors to focus on. Signs of a mental illness is most definitely the first and most important part of the interaction. If an officer is unable to see a crisis happening they will not know how to respond and might see if the person is not complying to directions as resistance and result in violence. If an officer can do see this they will know how to act accordingly. I like how you mentioned the consequence of each person within the criminal justice such as the intake officer in a corrections facility, a defense attorney, or a medical profession not recognizing the signs of a crisis. It is important to recognize how different people within the process need to know their part on order to really help the individual. Also, I like how you talked about actors knowing PWMI rights. This is especially important if they are brought to jail or a mental health facility because their right to privacy and consent should be taken very seriously.  Great post!"
1766,"Steve, I really enjoyed reading your ideas regarding what trainings should be covered for the criminal justice system with PWMI. I especially enjoyed reading your ideas because you have a first hand experience and really know what trainings are needed based off of I'm sure experiences you personally have experienced or know someone who has. The one training I thought was especially important that you brought up was the training for developmental disorders as these can definitely be even more challenging than people with mental disorders as they have a harder time understanding situations and seeing the police can be even more stressful on them. This wold definitely be an important one. Also,  I think you brought up a good point about mental health professional and criminal justice personnel and how they should work to understand each others jobs. Therefore I believe this could benefit the individual in crisis as these professionals will know what services are offered and where they are to get immediate help on the situation. "
1767,"I think that the diversion efforts such as those in Fairfax focus on the non-violent offenders because those who commit non violent crimes should not be put into jail and should instead be rehabilitated. I think that these efforts are aimed to rehabilitate non violent offenders because they are more likely to be changed. Also, I think it is common for people to believe that people who commit violent crimes should be punished for their actions. Violent offenders should be put in jail or prison, however, I do think that there should be some sort of rehabilitation as well to help them integrate back into society if they are ever released. This way offenders are not treated poorly while incarcerated and come out even more violent. "
1768,I think that hurdles can be the same for criminal justice and mental health agencies to implement evidence-based practices. I think this because these agencies are similar in budgets as there is not enough money in the budget to have adequate programs and practices. Evidence based practices are further than just treatment and incorporated family psycho education and illness self management. This will require more money as well as more staff that both agencies mostly do not have. 
1769,"I think an integrated MH and Substance Abuse model like that described in the video would change the way the justice system works with individual with cooccurring disorders because it will allow for early identification of cooccurring disorders which will help with earlier intervention to get people help. If both disorders are not identified than it will make treatment and recovery more difficult. I think that in implementation plan will be really useful in changing individuals life who are struggling with cooccurring disorders. Lastly, this model will change the way the justice system works with individuals with these disorders because they will be trained and the mental health agencies can inform the justice system about people with co occurring disorders."
1770,I think that peer mentoring would definietly be helpful on addressing stigma of mental health. This is because it allows for people who are struggling to relate to someone and see that they are not the only ones who are struggling. It also shows them that treatment can help them and rehabilitation can work. I think this will also allow people to have more resources from help.
1771,"Full implementation of the recommendations of the position paper of the American College of Physicians affect the involvement, identification, treatment, and outcomes of the mentally ill in the Criminal Justice system in many ways. First, full implementation of the recommendation of the position paper might affect the involvement, identification, treatment, and outcomes of the mentally ill in the Criminal Justice system because it will allow staff to be adequately trained and prepare to deal with mentally ill people. One of the recommendations is for the federal and state governments to provide relevant trainings and education for a better work place. Because of this I believe that there will be better outcomes of the mentally ill in the criminal justice system. I do not think that mentally ill people would be continuing to die in prison or just overall be mistreated. Another recommendation that would effect the identification and involvement especially of the mentally ill in the criminal justice system is the recommendation for reducing stigma. This will allow identification of certain illnesses e accepted and the stigma of mentally ill people being violent will not the reason why staff treat these people poorly and impose certain punishments on if they are “resisting.” These recommendations would be very much positive in the affects of involvement, identification, treatment, and outcomes of the mentally ill in the Criminal justice system."
1772,"Briana,  Very interesting ideas here. I found it interesting that you mentioned less people would be involved in the criminal justice system. This is definitely true because people with mentally ill could definitely receive treatment before they act in ways that would get them involved in the justice system. What you mentioned about these recommendations affecting when prisoners are released is especially important. We have leaned that after being released is especially difficult for prisoners with mental illness because they are stuck with no plan or help. These recommendation will definitely help those after being released because they will not have to find help alone it ill be provided to them through primary care. "
1773,"Hello everyone! My name is Bethannie and I live in Paramount, CA. I graduated from Cal State Long Beach with a BA in Sociology and a minor in Psychology. I became enrolled in this program because I have always had an interest in law and psychology. I was searching for the perfect maters for me and was becoming discouraged as most degrees focused on law or psych - but never both - until I found this program. I do not have any direct experience in this field, however I used to work as a behavioral therapist for children with disabilities. I hope to gain a better understanding of our the legal system is trained to handle though with mental health disorders -especially since mental disorders are not always easy to detect.    I look forward to a great quarter with you all! :) "
1774,"Based on the 60 minutes video, Timothy Sounders would not have died had the prison been more knowledgeable about mental health. Part of the video that was unsettled was the fact that they have a psychiatrist on stuff but the psychiatrist was on a vacation. There should have been someone filling in for that psychiatrist while they were out. Timothy Sounders needed  mental heath attention which could have prevented his death. The guarders should have taken it as a sign that he refuses water and he had not have any in days. At that point, Timothy Sounders should have been taken to the hospital for an ivy to hydrate him.  "
1775,Non-medical considerations driven provision of treatment and care for persons with mental illness would be President Harry Truman signing the mental health act which he wanted to cure mental illnesses. The signing of this act was then followed by the beginning of the national institute of mental health where treatment began to be considered for individuals with mental illnesses. 
1776,"I do believe the benefits outweigh the costs. The statistics speak for themselves as persons with mental illnesses are not dangerous. If there were more evidence to support that we should take away peoples rights due to them having a mental illness then i would understanding the registry. However, we have little evidence to justify stripping away someones constitutional rights. "
1777,I believe the most important problem to fix is after care/home care. There needs to be more support for outpatient programs for PWMI to be able to truly assist them with getting better. It is important to have continuous treatment for individuals even once they are no longer in the hospital or even for individuals who were never in the hospital. Outpatient facilities should be easier to access and join for PWMI. Mental health cannot be fixed over night - it takes time. We need to provide the assistance for PWMI so they can take the time they need to feel better. 
1778,"Mental illnesses have been viewed throughout the centuries as being cursed or as not being treatable. However, we have slowly been able to change the views of society through education. There are still many negative connotations associated with mental illnesses because of the past views on mental illness. Many other controversial issues deal with the same problems because it takes time to help education a society. I believe we are currently moving in the right direction to make the changes we need to make for the better of our population with mental illnesses. We need to continue educating society to help them understand that with the right treatment an individual with a mental illness is just as capable to be a member of our society.  "
1779,"I felt like the simple fact that the president was talking about mental health publically is a huge step. However, I believe he should continue the discussion to keep people talking. Many people listen to the presidential speeches (whether they agree or not).  I believe by simply discussing mental health others will begin to become more aware of the issues and we will be able to continue the awareness of the importance of mental health."
1780,"I think that the reduction of mental health benefits show that policymakers do not put mental health as a top priority. Society would rather focus their resources on visible health conditions  however many individuals in our society suffer from mental health disorders yet go untreated due to the stigma society has placed on people with mental illnesses. I believe the population with mental health conditions, especially those within low economical backgrounds, are being untreated. "
1781,"I would recommend making mental health mandatory group sessions for troops. Regardless if they self report they are experiencing complications from what they see or not, I believe it would help end the stigma of mental health among soldiers and help unite them by showing one another they are not alone. "
1782,"I believe in some situations we should be allowed to for their own safety. If they show signs of harming themselves or others we should step in for the best interest of them and others. However, if they do not show signs of danger to themselves or others, that responsibility may be upon a family member or a friend. However, many of these individiuals are homeless so there may not be anyone else watching out for them. I believe the best interest of the public would be our best way of deteremining if we should step in or not."
1783," Our educational system should combat the stigmas of mental health starting at an early age. We should be implementing the statistics of mental health in our classrooms. Especially since the odds of an individual having a mental health at a young age are possible and even more common as they enter adulthood. Many individuals suffer with mental illnesses in silence due to the stigma placed on them by society. If we are able to teach our children at a young age about mental health - as if it were any other health course - I believe as generations pass the stigma of individuals with mental illnesses would decrease while increasing the resources made available for individuals with mental illnesses.  Implementing mental health criteria in our elementary, middle and high schools can be beneficial for numerous reasons. As a society we place stigma on those with mental illnesses which later can result in individuals with mental illnesses self stigmatizing. We want to try to avoid individuals with mental illnesses from self stigmatizing. Self stigmatizing can lead to individuals giving up on daily tasks such as work and/or school - not due to their illness but due to their perception of their illness (Rusch, Angermyer, & Corrigan, 2005). The effects of an individual with mental illnesses giving up on life duties can affect not only themselves but their loved ones.  These individuals may not seek help because they are scared of what others might think of them. Resulting in individuals with mental illnesses not being able to properly function to complete their daily work/school duties. This turns into a cycle - if they cannot perform their duties they will not be able to afford to pay bills or may lose opportunities for a better future or lose relationships thus hurting those around them.   Many individuals I know suffer from mental illnesses and I truly believe that if we were to start reducing the stigma in the public (starting with our students) we can reduce self stigma and any harm that can be caused to families/friends of individuals with mental illnesses. We need to normalize mental illnesses and help our society understand ways to help individuals with mental illnesses succeed in society rather than pushing them further down."
1784,"I believe it would be really hard to be able to get an accurate test for civil commitment. If we raise our criteria for sensitivity and lower our specificity to ensure we are making an accurate prediction we risk placing more individuals under civil commitments than truly needed - however if we do the opposite we risk future harm for the individual and the public. There has to be a balance but unfortunately we would not be able to account for all of the false negatives or false positives. If we increase the number of false negatives we will potentially add risk/danger to society and individual being assessed, however if we increase the number of false positive we risk unlawfully violating an individuals rights. "
1785,"I believe the idea behind it is good - provide mental health services to sex offenders but my question is why are we waiting for them to finish their criminal sentence? We have already discussed the criminalization of individuals with mental illnesses and that many correctional facilities could use more mental health services. I believe these individuals should be getting the mental health assistance while serving their criminal sentence - like many other individuals incarcerated suffering from mental illnesses. I believe this would be beneficial in the long run for the individuals, their families and society. We will be putting more work into these individuals during a shorter amount of time which will overall decreases the amount of federal/state funds on individuals with mental illnesses incarcerated while maximizing the time they spend incarcerated."
1786,"I would consider inpatient commitment to be the larger reach into an individuals liberty because during inpatient treatment individuals are forced to abide by the hospitals rules such as medications, or attending therapy sessions. Outpatient therapy is much harder for the state to control obedience for (as stated in the lecture video above) some states implement contempt for noncompliance. "
1787," The pros of an inpatient involuntary commitment would be that the individual with the mental illness would be safer to themselves and others. Many inpatient facilities have doctors regularly on site if the individual would need immediate assistance, and the individual would be able to have access to medication regularly. However, some cons of inpatient involuntary commitment is that the individual is not being given his/her right to treatment/medical attention or the ability to live their daily social life thus taking away their constitutional rights. I believe that for an inpatient involuntary commitment it is more appropriate for us to have cross-examinations of the patient to ensure the individual truly is in need of an inpatient involuntary commitment given that their constitutional rights are being taken if placed in involuntary commitment. I believe it would be best that all screeners/evaluators of the individual have no preconceived notions of the individual to decrease bias.   The pros of an outpatient involuntary commitment would be that the individual is still allowed to participate in school/work/social life. They have more freedom than inpatient as the outpatient program is typically a few hours a day for a few times a week. Some cons can be that the individual does not comply with the sentence to outpatient program - they may refuse to take medication or even attend therapy session as directed which will ultimately lead to them not receiving proper treatment and increasing their risk of becoming an inpatient or even becoming unable to participate in their daily routes (if their behaviors/symptoms begin to increase).   Reflecting on this week’s lecture for determining involuntary commitment, I would suggest we would want to find a fine balance between sensitivity and specificity to ensure that individuals who are truly endanger to themselves and/or others are properly placed into inpatient commitments and those who do not meet the requirements are placed into outpatient commitments. However, in a perfect world there is always error. To avoid increase harm to society and individuals I would argue it is in the best interest of the public to slightly inflate sensitivity for inpatient involuntary commitment and deflate the specificity. The reason I felt this would be best is because I believe there is a greater risk if a pe"
1788,"Hi Briana, I am glad you linked in last week with this weeks discuss regarding stigma. We need to begin educating our society on mental health so that people will be more willing to speak out when they are in need of assistance rather than allowing their mental health condition to even get to the point of involuntary commitment (inpatient or outpatient). I truly believe over time we can begin to end these stigmas but it will take a long time. Even if we reduce stigma we may have some individuals who are not aware of how bad their mental illness is - in those situations I also indicated they need to be evaluated every step of the way to ensure we are treating them as best we can. The overall goal is to help them become just as involved in society as the next person. Great post!! "
1789,Hi Gabby!   I agree we should try our best to allow individuals with mental illnesses in outpatient programs so that they can live their daily lives. In a situation where an individual does not meet the criteria to be an outpatient and must be an inpatient I believe we should do our best to try to limit the stay of an inpatient stay so that individuals can switch to an outpatient program if they still need assistance after their inpatient stay. I think this would be a good way of balancing one's liberties while allowing them to still live their lives. 
1790,"I love the idea of creating a childrens book to introduce mental health conditions - that idea is very age appropriate. I also like your idea for middle school and high schoolers. Your post is making me think of different ways we can be creative about teaching mental health courses. In 5th grade we had to pick a mission and do a report on it. I think it would be a great idea if middle/high schoolers had a health class that require them to do a report on a mental illness. I think this would help spread awareness throughout the school. Or even a week similar to ""red ribbon week"" where they have a different dressed theme every day of the week to increase mental health awareness. Great post!! Really got me thinking!"
1791,"I love your post! I am such a huge believer in targeting the younger generation for that exact reason. I truly believe that is how our values begin to shift - we need to teach our younger generation so they can grow up and teach their children and eventually we will get to a place that is more comfortable than it is today. In a perfect world we would have no bias, racism, or any other negative stigmas but unfortunately we do not live in that world - all we can do is work with what we have now. Teach our younger generations to see individuals - not mental illnesses. "
1792,It appears to me that adjudication would be the most difficult for an individual with a mental illness to navigate through. I believe this would be the most difficult portion because the individual must understand the difference and risks to consider when taking a plea deal versus going to trial. Many lawyers may push for these individuals to take a plea deal rather than going to trial because trials often require much more work for the lawyers. This can especially be problematic if the individual being prosecuted is there under a false confession. 
1793,I feel that it will be easier to address the mental health issues among the felon population if they are being held as a county level because state prisons are typically more concentrated. However I can also see this being a negative impact as counties will have more individuals with mental illnesses and less resources to provide the proper care needed. 
1794,I would not say it is either fair or unfair that police officers are first responders to situations rather than saying it is unfair police officers are not trained on how to properly handle individuals with mental illnesses. I believe by not provided the proper training for our officers we are essentially setting them up for failure and setting up our population with mental illnesses up with the same failure. Our officers should be trained on how to interact with every population they must encounter on the job. 
1795,"CIT allows officers to obtain training on individuals with mental illnesses which essentially ends the stigmatization against individuals with mental illnesses. Often times individuals with mental illnesses are seen to be dangerous or out of control, this training allows officers to understand individuals with mental illnesses by identifying them, understanding effects of their medications, and deescalation techniques."
1796,"Based on this week’s lectures and readings, mental illness has been viewed in several ways throughout history. In pre-civilization, early tribes believed mental health illness came from the person’s family and within their own bodies. They tried to fix a person’s brain from the inside out. People who were identified with mental illnesses suffered from torcher. There were holes drilled in their skulls and their brains were removed from inside their skulls because it was believed the evil spirits would be released from within. Eventually, it appeared that in the ancient civilizations, people such as Hippocrates, the father of medicine, recognized mental health illnesses included phobias, anxiety, depression and mania. However, he too believed that treatment for such mental issues could be treated with surgeries and laxatives which would purify a person’s internal system. During this time period, mental health illnesses was viewed as a phenomenon and it was hard for people to understand that mental illness was a true illness and not something a person was born with or cursed with. During the Middle Ages, mental illness was combined with Religion. It was believed people with mental illness were possessed with evil spirits. During this time, people believed in evils such as “The dybbuk from Judaism” which was believed to be the cause of mental illness. There was also the belief that people who experienced physical signs were known to have “Stigmata Diablo” and “Devil spots.” In the late 1400’s, the Catholic Church also believed people who suffered from mental illness were witches. Over 250 years, up to nine million people, including mentally ill individuals, were killed by being drowned or burned at the stake. It was not until the Ancient Greeks and Romans believed people who suffered from mental illness needed to be treated just like any other human beings and they should be treated better than they did in the past, specifically how they were treated in the pre-civilization period. Today, it seems that menta health illness is viewed as it was in the 1960’s and 1970’s where society takes on the “Not in my backyard” attitude. People today perceive individuals who suffer from mental health issues such as bipolar, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety disorders are violent. There is an embellished perception that mentally ill people will harm themselves and themselves. According to this week’s lectures, people today are reluctant to"
1797,"Hi Denise, Great post! You and I both recognized how much people who have been identified as having a mental health issue have suffered throughout history. I too referenced the lectures involving the mentally ill and how during pre-civilization early tribes believed their illness came from their bodies and they had to try and fix them by taking their brains from their skulls to release the evil spirits. During the middle ages, the mentally ill suffered torcher and were drowned and burned at the stake because they were believed to be witches. It was believed their illness was something they were born or cursed with. As you indicated, I also recognized that throughout history the mentally ill have been “ridiculed, harassed and harshly punished.” It is clear after listening to the lectures and reading the articles by Thomas Szasz and Julie Beck, there are a lot of misconceptions about the mentally ill, including that they are violent and a threat to society. Were you surprised about the statistics involving the mentally ill and gun violence? I was a bit shocked to read that 96% of crime involving gun violence in the United States, do not involve the mentally ill. You also brought up some great points on how people who suffer from mental health illness are deprived of their liberties and freedoms by being institutionalized without the ability to contest it. I appreciated how you pointed out that despite this controversial issue, there were laws such as  Wyatt v. Stickney that were enacted to ensure improved conditions at hospitals and to enhance the ability of actual recovery. I agree that the perception exists that because someone who is determined to be a “danger to himself or others” and is institutionalized that their liberties and freedoms are being violated. However, I think its important that society does understand that in some cases, this is necessary. Some mentally ill people should be institutionalized because they are a “danger to themselves or others.” Therefore, I agree with you and believe it is society’s responsibility to educate themselves on this subject so they can understand whether or not this is true. You and I are on the same page and have the same thought process about being educated regarding mental health. I too believe people should understand mental illness, know how mental illness is defined, what it means to suffer from mental illness and the truths about rehabilitation when individuals are treat"
1798,"Hi Elise, Great post! I agree with your statement that mental health illness is viewed as “the idea of social norms” during the time it’s being assessed. As you indicated in the beginning of your post, the consensus throughout history on how mental illness was perceived and how it was defined came down to the fact that it was not considered normal. From the times during pre-civilization, the middle ages, the times of Ancient Romans and Greeks, and through the last 50 years, mental illness did not fit the mold of normal mental health, which automatically made abnormal and did not fit our “social norms.” I too recognized how these perceptions corresponded to the Ted talk by Crystal Dieleman you referred to and how people with mental health issues were outcasted from society all around. I agreed with your thoughts and the Ted lecture that the mentally ill are not accepted by society because there are a lot of negative perceptions that the mentally ill are dangerous and could harm us without warning. I also agreed with your statement that mental illness must be accepted in order to experience a change on how we view those with mental health issues. Although I understand why people are hesitant to let their guard down when interacting with these individuals, I agree that accepting them into the everyday facets of our lives will start to allow them to be accepted by society. We must change the hesitance on embracing these individuals and openly allow them into our own homes, communities, jobs, schools, churches and social settings all around. I understand it is hard to ignore the perceptions, but that is why it is important to obtain solid evidence and research that supports whether there is a true reason to want to keep these individuals out of our communities. I am the first to admit, I was surprised with the statistics involving gun violence and mental health individuals. I was a bit shocked that only 4% of crimes in the United States involving gun violence involved suspects who were mentally ill. It was clear to me that being educated on this subject was the answer to better understanding mental health illness and the probability that these individuals are not as harmful as society perceives. Based on your post, I think you too agree that educating ourselves is at least one answer to the current problem of society accepting these individuals. Do you also agree that being educated about mental health will help all of us shed"
1799,I was surprised with the statistics provided in the article by Julie Beck.  I would have never guesses that only 4% of crimes involving gun violence involved the mentally ill.  I seriously thought that percentage would be higher.
1800,"I agree what happened during his stay was significant, but I also thought about how he was failed from his early childhood years."
1801,"Dr. Turner, Did you need us to reply to your weekly video overview?? There is reply box at the end of your announcement??"
1802,"A way a president can be effective in bringing about an end to the stigma of mental illness is by doing exactly what President Obama did. President Obama held a press conference to specifically address the stigma with mental health illness and why we need to shed that stigma. He was clear that mental illness is not something we should “whisper” about and need to openly talk about it.   President Obama addressed the fact that society needs to talk about mental illness and accept it as an illness just as any other physical illness. He brought the subject forward and expressed the importance that society understands mental illness is something people suffer from and need to seek help just as any other illness. He was clear that society needed to accept mental illness as an official illness so that people were not be ashamed or hesitant to seek help. A president should do what President Obama did by describing mental illness as an illness that anyone of us could have and deal with just as any other illness. He used analogies such as seeking medical attention for the flu or a broken body part and compared it seeking help for mental illness. This allowed the average person to relate with the individuals who were suffering from these issues. President Obama also voiced his own opinion that we need to accept mental illness and shed the stigma so that people do not feel “embarrassed” or the burden they believe is placed on family and friends who have to deal with their issues. He indicated seeking treatment for mental illness should be the same as seeking treatment for any other illness or disease. He was also smart to talk about how people go the doctor for more personal issues and mental illness is not as intimate as other illnesses. A president should use analogies just as President Obama and remind society that people seek treatment for embarrassing things such as sexually transmitted diseases and mental illness should not more embarrassing than these types of diseases. A president should also do what President Obama did by speaking directly to the mentally ill. During President Obama’s speech, he spoke directly to the individuals who suffered from mental health issues. He made direct statements to these individuals and reassured them they “are not alone” and he along with other Americans were committed to support their needs when it came to their treatment and road to recovery. I think it makes a significant impact when the president makes s"
1803,"From my perspective, the movement towards reducing benefits for mental health care says policy maker’s views on the “worthiness” of mental versus other health care is that mental health care is not valid or worth it. I think policy makers do not agree mental health care should be paid with tax paying dollars because the funds are going to health care for mental illnesses, which is not viewed a “true” illnesses. I do not think society has accepted mental illness as an illness or disease and simply perceive it is the mental status a person chooses to have and could change if they truly wanted to. I can only assume these perceptions influence the policy makers to also believe mental illness is a choice and truly not a health issue we should be wasting resources on. I also think policy makers not only feel the health treatment is unnecessary as it is for official illnesses such as cancer, diabetes, and aids, but also not worthy of spending money on such “medical” treatment, because they do not consider it being a medical issue. I perceive policy makers simply do not want spend the funding on mental health care for routine psychological evaluations and necessary medication the mentally ill consistently have to go through and obtain. I believe they feel the funding could be spent on more “worthy” diseases that people are actually dying from such as cancer, diabetes, aids, and other terminal diseases that also require long term treatments. I think a lot of the perceptions developed by people in the United States influence our policy makers because they rely on their support during the election process and if they do not appease their audience they will not be voted into office. Policy makers have no choice but apply the funds where the public feels they are necessary. Today a significant amount of people in society are not educated enough in this subject and perceive mental illness is not a disease. The perception is that some of these illnesses are created by the individual, a result from drug use and could be something a person can cure themselves if they really wanted to. I think the average American, when thinking about health care they think the significant illnesses we see on commercials and the news. Illness such as breast, lung and colon cancer, leukemia, HIV and other deadly illnesses get the attention of most people in society and that is where people feel the health care needs are. Even sexual transmitted diseases and biological defi"
1804,"After viewing the video interview with Chris, the Army veteran who served a total of 3 years in the service and over 3 months in Iraq, given the service’s member’s experiences with medication for mental illness in the military, I would not recommend mental health treatment for the active military or the veterans to include most psych medications. As Chris indicated in his interview, military personnel is already on “edge” when dealing with the thoughts of getting bombed, shot at and basically killed everywhere they go while they are deployed. According to Chris, he himself indicated it would not be a good idea to treat these individuals with medication after coming back from being deployed because most of them are suffering from PTSD, and the medication will only enhance hallucinations, mania, psychosis, and suicidal and homicidal thoughts. Based on Chris’ interview, medicating individuals with psych medications who are already vulnerable will most likely only worsen their mental status and add to their erratic thoughts. As Chris indicated, his choice was not to use medication to get him through his issues involving PTSD and for him, talking about his experiences with other veterans, both current and former not only helped him to get through his tough times, but also the other veterans. I agree with Chris that medication is not always the answer and these types of individuals who are coming back from war, after being involved in gun battles, have developed psychological problems and should in fact sit down and talk about their issues. As Chris also indicated, talking with people who know what you are going through, helps the person open up because they recognize someone else has gone through what they have and understand they had similar feelings. Talking to people with similar experiences allows the person to relate to others and not feel alone. This type of interaction could make the person feel accepted as an individual, despite what they are going through mentally. I recommend veterans go through mandatory counseling whether or not they seek it themselves because as Chris also mentioned pride can prevent veterans from seeking help. Chris’ pride did not allow him to ask for help, he instead chose alcohol to initially deal with his problems before ever seeking help from his fellow veterans. It is important our veterans are offered counseling in a way they do not need to feel embarrassed or ashamed. This way if it is a requirement rathe"
1805,"I think society should have the right to “step in” and mandate treatment when PWMI do not acknowledge they are ill because despite the majority of the lecture and reading material from this week and last week, there are people who are in fact mentally ill and refuse to obtain it, whether it is because they do not recognize they have an illness or simply do not want it. I think when the state should interfere with mandating treatment is when the person who is mentally ill is a “danger to himself or others.” In this case it could be someone who is threatening to kill themselves and could be so suicidal they go out a commit crimes against people in the hopes of getting killed by the police, also known as “suicide by cop.” Ignoring this type of individual and not “stepping in” by ensuring they are mandated to psychological evaluations and mental health treatment exposes the person as well as the public to danger and people at risk to serious bodily injury or death. I think it society’s responsibility to protect each other, and if there are people who do not seek treatment because they do not have the ability to help themselves, then we owe it to them and the public to ensure they are mandated to seek help. In the example I used by a person who is suicidal and has the intention to harm themselves and others, it is our responsibility to enact laws that allow law enforcement officials or medical professionals to assess these individuals and have the authority to have the institutionalized for mental health evaluations. Government officials and medical staff should have the right to lodge these individuals as they due per W&amp;I 5150, which mandates 72-hour mental health evaluations. I also believe that if people with mental illness who need assistance whether its psychological assessment, mental health treatment and/or medication, have a choice to obtain treatment, even if it is necessary for their stability, rehabilitation or potential recovery, they could chose not to obtain it. Failing to obtain any type of treatment, will not only prolong any potential rehabilitation but eliminates the chances of ever establishing stability and recovery. The reality is some of these people who are mentally ill, do not have the mental capacity to truly understand they need help. I view someone who is mentally ill who does not have the mental capacity to recognize they need help, the same as children. When children are too young to care for themselve"
1806,"There are numerous forms of stigma related to PWMI. Rusch et al. (2005) supports that society misinterprets all aspects of mental health illnesses, which then creates stigma. Stigma is created by society’s negative perceptions and prejudices about a certain group such as the PWMI. It is imperative that our education professionals begin to teach their students that these misconceptions are incorrect and harmful for both the PWMI and society as whole. In my opinion, several things should be taught and implemented in school curriculums in elementary, middle and high schools to combat the stigma related to PWMI. School curriculums regardless the grade level, should include a subject on mental health illness. This will allow teachers the opportunity to define and describe mental illness so students understand what it means and understand what is like to suffer from mental illness. In addition, it allows teachers the opportunity to openly speak about mental illness, which will then allow students to accept the subject easier. Students can begin to accept mental illness as an everyday subject as they do the awkward subject “sexual education.” Therefore, although it may a bit awkward at first, as it is when they educate students about sex, it will eventually become something children / adolescents are accustomed to talk about just as they do sexual education. Talking about mental health illness in our schools will change the thought that this a subject we need to “whisper” about such as President Obama indicated in his speech. It is imperative that teachers in schools talk with their students about mental health because it is a way to deliver the message to students that it is ok to talk about this illness. Openly talking about mental health illness at a young age, will begin to enforce the mindset that people do suffer from such an illness. It is then that it can begin to be viewed just as any other illness such as cancer, diabetes, and leukemia. It is also important that children/students understand and familiarize themselves with the symptoms and situations that are involved with someone who suffers from mental illnesses so they are not afraid or unaccepting of those individuals. As indicated in our lectures, readings and even President Obama’s speech, accepting these individuals is the road to shedding the stigma of the mentally ill. The earlier we educate the children who will grow up to run our country, the sooner we can begin to m"
1807,"Hi Briana, We shared similar thoughts about mental health illness being a subject implemented into the education system. I agree with you that the earlier we begin to educate our children/students, the sooner they will begin to understand mental illness and if they too suffer from it, can begin to seek help. Do you agree that one of the most important reasons to implement mental health into our public education is to prevent “self-stigma”??? I believe that Rusch et al. (2005) discussed what is probably one the most important reasons to implement mental health education in our schools. The development of “self-stigma” is something young children and adolescents could easily fall into. They are so vulnerable at such a young age that they are susceptible to agreeing with the negative perceptions of mental illness and use self-stigma to diminish their own confidence. The more they know about self-stigma, the greater chances they do not develop it. I also agree with your “us versus” them statement. I too believe that the sooner we get our students to accept PWMI, the easier it is going to be for children/students who do not suffer from this illness to be welcoming to those that do. I think it is important that teachers have the opportunity to teach their students the true definition of mental illness and what to expect from those who suffer from it. I also believe is a great opportunity for teachers to be open about the subject and speak freely about mental illness. I think this is one of the ways students will be more willing to discuss the subject and it will be easier to talk about it. As I indicated in my own post, students would eventually be just as comfortable about discussing mental illness as it is talking about sex in sex education classes. You make some good points on how there is bias and stigmas with mental illness, but they do not exist with other significant illnesses such as cancer. You mentioned you did not compare them prior to this week’s material, do you feel mental illness is just as important now based on what you know now? You also made a good argument how the stigmas exist with bipolar, schizophrenia and depression, but there is no scrutiny over cancer. You also make a good argument with the statistical information regarding suicides, because although mental illness is not an illness that could kill you physically such as Cancer, the illness can get someone to kill themselves and therefore ends"
1808,"Hi Viviana, You and I both recognized the significant information provided in the article by Rusch et al. (2005) and why it was important children/students are educated with the three misunderstandings about PWMI. We agreed that teachers should educate their students about these misconceptions so they understand that PWMI are falsely perceived as “homicidal maniacs” who society should be afraid of, and believed to be “rebellious, free spirits” who “have childlike perceptions of the world that should be marveled.” Until children/students are provided with accurate information about PWMI, they will continue to be outcasts and not accepted into our communities, jobs, schools, churches, and social settings. Rusch et al. (2005) describes how PWMI are known to “irresponsible” and because they are not capable of making decisions for themselves, they become a burden for someone else, like infants who rely on their mothers. Do you agree these three misunderstandings are the most common stigmas about PWMI? You bring up some significant points and issues I did not address in my own post about mental illness. I did not discuss the stigmas that not only affect the PWMI but also their families. You are correct that PWMI, who experience the negative stigmas that come with mental illness, also affect their family/friends because they care about the person and will feel the pain their loved one is going through. I recognized these stigmas would lead to prejudice against the PWMI, but your post made me recognize those prejudices could also be transferred to the family. This not only impacts the PWMI but many other people. This is even more of a reason to educate our children so they can develop accurate information and perceptions of PWMI to prevent them from developing such prejudices. I was not surprised that you too recognized the key to prevent from these prejudices and stereotypes was through educating our youth. Do you agree this is one of the best ways to break the cycle you referred to??? I also appreciated your thoughts on using the analogy of children being subject to annual medical check-ups. You are right that children are required to go to the doctor to ensure they are developing as scheduled. I agree with your thoughts about mental health care not being any different and you questioning children/adolescents/adults not having to be checked on their mental health status to make sure they are not in need of mental health care.

1809,"  Specificity and sensitivity compare test results that indicate true positive and true negative results and false negatives and false positives results. According to the video, sensitivity is the proportion of people who have a disease and have a positive test result; ratio true positives, true positive plus false negatives. Specificity is the proportion of people who do not have a disease and have a negative test result; ratio true negative, true negative plus false positives. When researchers conduct research, they use result charts that indicate the specific results. As indicated in the lecture, when your doctor conducts both radiological and laboratory tests, the results can be imperfect. There is always the probability that something concerning is missed or diagnoses as something it is not. In these tests the results can be determined they came from a good or bad test. If these tests were perfect than all patients would result in positive results. The video supports, in a perfect world, the results would be 100% correct and there would not be any “bad results” also knowns as a “false negatives” and “false positives.” It also supported it is best to discover diseases and not miss these diagnoses, which will eliminate false negatives. The concepts of specificity and sensitivity discussed in the video in this week’s lecture can apply to the decision of civil commitment because those testing methods are like the ones done when evaluating individuals for mental illness. Mental health professionals evaluate PWMI and determine if their symptoms are positively demonstrating symptoms of mental illness or not. They determine if they are positive or negative and true or false behaviors that indicate they the individual is suffering from a mental illness such as bipolar, schizophrenia, manic, psychosis, and depression. Just as specificity and sensitivity testing methods could provide true/false positives and negatives, so can the assessment of individuals. There could be misdiagnoses by medical staff, which can either identify someone who is not mentally ill as someone who is suffering from mental health issues or fail to identify a PWMI when they truly do suffer from mental illness. Another example where these errors can occur are situations involving assessments by police officers. I speak with experience in this part of this discussion because I am a police officer and have assessed numerous individuals for mental health iss"
1810,"I think involuntary commitment of sex offenders for violent sexual predators after they complete their sentence a good idea, because the case of Megan Kanka speaks for itself about how violent sex offenders do in fact have a high probability of committing sexual crimes again. In 1994, Megan Kanka who was only 7-years-old was raped and killed by repeat sex offender, Jesse Timmendequas, who lived across the street from Megan with two other sex offenders. Timmendequas lured Megan into his home where he raped and strangled her. Timmendequas was not a first time sex offender. In 1979, Timmendequas was charged with aggravated sexual assault on a five-year-old girl in New Jersey. He plead guilty to the crime and agreed to go to counseling. Because Timmendequas’ he failed to attend counseling, his sentence was suspended and was then mandated to serve a NINE month sentence at Middlesex Adult Correctional Center. In 1981, Timmendequas once again was charged with assaulting a 7-year-old girl, and sentenced to six years. During his incarceration, Timmendequas attended minimal therapy sessions and was described as a “whiner” who was always sleeping. One of the therapists indicated she believed Timmendaquas “WOULD commit another sex crime but DID NOT believe he would commit murder.” Obviously, this was a failure of assessment and failure of the system. Even if “RAPING” a child is not “MURDER”, it should be significant enough to mandate a sexual violent predator to involuntary commitment to prevent them from committing future crimes against ANY child. Perhaps if Timmendaquas would have been mandated to involuntary commitment the first time, his second victim would not have been victimized and Megan would be alive today. These type of individuals are not ones we should leave to chance. It is a good idea to ensure rapist such as Timmendequas, who even at the early stages of adulthood displayed the probability of reoffending, be forced into being institutionalized. In all cases involving violent sexual predators, who have prior sex offenses, despite the probability of committing harsher crimes such as murder, should be mandated to involuntary commitment. Perhaps this is the only way we can truly protect our children and communities from criminals who just cannot help themselves from being sexual predators, and they truly can benefit from being institutionalized because they will be mandated to psychological evaluations. This will affirm their asse"
1811,"I think outpatient commitment is the larger reach of state authority into an individual’s liberty because the PWMI is not legally obligated to seek help because they do not meet the civil commitment criteria. According to this week’s reading, “Involuntary Civil Commitments: Common Questions and A Review of State Practices” most states, including California, a person who is considered a “danger to themselves or others and/or gravely disabled” will meet W&amp;I 5150, which authorizes the state to lodge the PWMI at a hospital for up to 72-hours for a psychological evaluation. In cases where an individual meets this criteria, it is easy to take their freedom away and have them institutionalized without violating their liberties and civil rights. The state has the legal right and authority because of the probability the PWMI is a danger to the community. However, in the case of outpatient commitment, violating someone’s liberty and freedom, and forcing them to be institutionalized is not as simple. According to this week’s lecture and Swanson et al., (2009), outpatient commitment includes orders that require the patient to obey with the “recommended” treatment. However, this does not guarantee the patient will follow through with the treatment and this is when medical officials can seek a court hearing against the patient for institutionalization. Although outpatient commitment is one type of mental health treatment that individuals can continue to experience life with the freedom of being out in society and living their life as usual (go to school, work, church, and attend social functions), the state still can infringe on their liberty, but it requires additional legal intervention. In this case, if the PWMI refuses or fails to obtain their treatment, they can be forced to complete it and/or require the patients take medication. This type of commitment, although does not completely infringe on the PWMI, according to this week’s lecture and readings, can be perceived as the state still having the right to violate the liberty of a PWMI. The fact that the PMWI is forced to take medication or participate in therapy sessions during the week is also viewed as “coercive” which supports the PWMI’s civil rights were violated. In an inpatient commitment, the state does not have to reach far in order to infringe on the PWMI’s liberties and freedom. If the state believes the PWMI is a “danger to themselves or others or is gravely disabled” and needs to"
1812,"There several pros and cons involving inpatient and outpatient involuntary commitment. According to the reading in Chapter 4, one of the pros about involuntary commitment is that people who are a “danger to themselves and others or are gravely disabled” are mandated to psychological evaluations for up to 72-hours. During this time, PWMI can be assessed for their mental health issues and determine if they do in fact suffer from a mental illness and need psychological assistance, therapy and perhaps need to be placed on medication. The purpose of this institutionalization is to try and provide the PWMI some resources and ability to obtain necessary mental health attention and potentially lead them to a road of mental stability or even recovery. The cons discussed in both the text readings and articles by Swanson et al., (2009), are the perceptions that involuntary commitment is coercive and takes away people’s freedom and liberties. Despite the interest of protecting the individual and society, this can be perceived as violating the PWMI’s civil rights. Because the person does not have a choice to seek treatment and basically is being seized for the purpose of being institutionalized, a person can see this as being a negative aspect towards the quality of their life. Although the PWMI should in fact be lodged for evaluation, the con is that their freedom is taken away and they do not have the choice to accept/deny treatment. This can include being subject to take medication, again a con if perceived their rights are being infringed upon. I think appropriate measures of success for involuntary commitment forms of treatment for an individual is to evaluate and assess the type of treatment they are receiving during the PWMI’s involuntary stay and what resulted from that stay. For instance, we should have followed up assessments for someone who was lodged for a 72-hour mental health evaluation per W&amp;I 5150. There should be medical professionals who assess exactly what was done during the 72-hour evaluation process. Was the PWMI psychologically evaluated by a medical professional such as psychiatrist or psychologist or was their head/brain examined with medical equipment? (MRI’s, brain scans, etc.). Was the PWMI verbally interviewed? (asked questions about their mental health history, etc.) or obtained official therapy. Was the person diagnosed with any official illness such as bipolar, schizophrenia, mania, psychosis, depression, anxiety o"
1813,"Hi Jennifer, I shared your thoughts and agreed with your statement that regardless of inpatient or outpatient involuntary commitment, the purpose of both treatment plans was to “protect the individual and society.” I agree with your opinions that ultimately when people are determined a “danger to themselves or others or gravely disabled”, as indicated criteria described in the Chapter 4 & 5 text readings, Swanson et al., (2009) and WSIPP readings, the state should have the right to lodge these individual for 72-hour mental health evaluations to ensure they get the mental health treatment they need. As you pointed out, this individual could be someone who knows they need help but perhaps has no means of obtaining that treatment because they do not have insurance or money to obtain such help. This is one way that the person gets treatment, even though it would be at a taxpayer’s expense, but at least the result will benefit the safety of the individual and society. You also recognized some of the issues I too discussed in my post. As indicated in the text readings, people who are institutionalized against their will is because they meet the W&amp;I 5150 criteria, which indicates they in fact are a “danger to themselves or others or gravely disabled.” However, you are right that although the PWMI truly needs help and it is beneficial for them and society, the PWMI can perceive their civil rights were violated. These individuals, despite the fact they need mental health care, can perceive their freedom was taken away for unnecessary reasons and because they are being held against their will, they can believe their liberties are being infringed upon. The PWMI, despite the necessary need for them to be institutionalized, may feel their freedoms were taken away and therefore their civil rights were violated. Also, you again make a good argument that according to this week’s lectures, outpatient involuntary commitment was the treatment that kept PWMI to maintain their freedom and everyday lifestyles. However, this was determined to be coercive by nature because the PWMI could be subject to strict rules with the outpatient program and obligation to take medication. You made an excellent point with your final statement that at the end of the day, these programs should “diminish the chances of relapse.” Great post!"
1814,"  Hi Elise, I agree with your thoughts about the pros about inpatient and outpatient involuntary commitment care. I too believe that these types of involuntary commitments get PWMI who need the care, get it. Chapter 4 & 5 of the text clearly indicate that people who need to be institutionalized per the criteria that qualify them for a 72-hour mental health evaluation, are because they are truly a “danger to themselves or other or are gravely disabled. I agree with you that if these individuals do not know any better and do not seek help on their own than the state not only should have the right to ensure they obtain it, but also an obligation. The state is not only looking out for the individual, but it is looking out for the safety of the community and society. I also agreed with your thoughts about “constant supervision” of these individuals. I also discussed in my post, although the lectures and videos this wee support that funding is a reason why follow up mental health care is diminishing, ensuring we follow up with PWMI after they are lodged for 72-hour mental health evaluations is necessary. After reading your posts and several of other classmate posts, I think we all agree that the cons involve the perception that involuntary commitments infringe on people’s lives, liberties and freedom. Most of us recognized that not having the right to refuse being institutionalized and not having the right to refuse medication as indicated in this week’s lectures and Chapter 4 readings, could be perceived as not having “any” rights or the same rights as any other citizen of the United States. You made a great argument that failing to allow a PWMI who is institutionalized against their will could be perceived as failure to provide that individual with due process and a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Again, the consensus amongst all of us were that we should follow up with PWMI’s who are institutionalized. We all agreed that the state should follow up with them after their 72-hour mental health evaluations to determine if the treatment made an impact on their mental health status and if they are need for further evaluations/assessments and treatment. Great post!"
1815,"Hi Dr. Turner, I haven't used Zoom, but am familiar with Power Point.  "
1816," Of the stages of the criminal justice system described in the video, the stage that seems most difficult for PWMI to navigate is the Trial Process.  The reason I believe this would be the most difficult for someone who is a PWMI is because this would require the PWMI to not only understand they committed a crime in the first place, but to have the ability to understand the criminal procedures involved in court.  The PWMI would have to understand that they will need to make significant decisions on how they desire to move forward after being charged with a crime.  This would require a healthy mental status, which in the case of a PWMI, you most likely would not have.    This stage would be most difficult because the PWMI would need to understand they were charged with a crime and comprehend their decision to plead guilty, not guilty or take a plea bargain.  This stage requires the PWMI to be competent and to have the ability to mentally understand and comprehend what is being asked of them.  They need to be understand if they plead not guilty, it will lead to a trial who they choose to have by a judge or jury, they need to understand if they plead guilty, this means they are willing to accept the legal/sentencing consequences, or they need to understand if they choose to take a plea bargain, it is similar to pleading guilty, but usually a lesser sentence.  The trial process is the most challenging for PWMI because it requires them to make significant decisions during court proceedings, and it is critical they are of sound mind to understand the procedures and what they are being asked.  Getting arrested, going to jail, being sentenced do not require the PWMI to make any decisions.  Those stages just occur, and they can just go through the motions. However, the trial process requir"
1817," The potential challenges that might arise for PWMI with the recent changes in California corrections to shift responsibility for large numbers of felons from the state to local jurisdiction would be the opportunity for PWMI to obtain mental health care while incarcerated.  The U.S. Supreme court ordered the state to reduce overcrowding in state prisons, which led to state inmates being transferred to county jails.  This resulted in the overcrowding in county jails, which forced California to make budget cuts for their county jails.  These budget cuts included the funds allotted for mental health resources, mental health treatment and medication.  The budget cuts specifically effected and eliminate resources for mental health treatment.  This was to compensate the added expenses due the overcrowding in the county jails.    In Orange County, the county jails are already experiencing budget cuts that have eliminated mental health resources and treatment for inmates who suffer from mental illness, including drug treatment.  Certain wings at Orange County Jail and cell blocks are understaffed and not being used at all because of the budget cuts for personnel.  Because of limited cell space, inmates were being released earlier than expected.  These innates who had the opportunity to obtain mental health care, treatment, therapy and medication, while being incarcerated, now miss out on the resources usually available in jail and are being releases without the treatment.  PWMI are part of these inmates being releases without treatment and now on the streets with no hope for mental health stabilization or recovery.  Also, Prop 47 which reclassified felony crimes to misdemeanor crimes, also pushed felony prisoners into cou"
1818," I do think it is fair for police officers to serve as first responders to situations involving PWMI because of the potential dangers involving PWMI.  As in the situation demonstrated in the video, although it would be ideal to have a psychiatrist or psychologist to be the first person to contact the PWMI (who could also be armed as the individual in the video), it simply is not safe for the medical professional.  The PWMI be armed and attack a medical professional if they were the first to respond to incidents such as the one in video without having any protection from the police.  If a medical professional was the first to respond to a PWMI as the one in the video, the medical professional risks being harmed or possibly killed, despite their purpose of responding to try and help the PWMI.  I understand the thought process about having someone who is educated and trained to deal with a PWMI, to be the best person to initially contact these individuals because trained mental health professionals know what to say to a PWMI.  The know how to talk to them, know how to engage them and ultimately establish a rapport with them to determine how they can help the PWMI.  However, the reality is some of these PWMI, truly are manic, schizophrenic, hear voices, are psychotic and could truly hurt someone, including the mental health professional responds to help them.  This a chance, the government is not willing to take and therefore has establish laws and procedures for law enforcement to be the ones to make initial contact in situations such as the video.  Law enforcement is obligated to ensure safety and make sure the PWMI is contacted and safely detained for the medical staff that will ultimately need to interact with the PWMI.  Law enforcement is mandated to ensure anyone who"
1819,"Crisis Intervention Teams (CIT) and stigma are related because there is a stigma involved with PWMI and the police officers who interact with them, specifically the police officers assigned to CIT and designated to interact with them. CIT have been created as a result of all the recent shootings involving PWMI. According to the video in this lesson (4.4), 1/10 calls for service that officers respond to involve PWMI. Police officers who are assigned to Crisis Intervention Teams and are Crisis Negotiators believe when they are exposed to PWMI and must deal with them during their calls for service, they have to jeopardize their safety when engaging these subjects. CIT were created to shed that stigma for police officers and train them to deal with PWMI in an appropriate, effective and safe manner. According to this week’s lesson, Crisis Intervention Training has been found to potentially change law enforcement officers stigmatizing attitudes towards people with mental illness. Police officer training went from only having to commit to 8-hour training involving PWMI to up to 40 hours of training. CIT and Crisis Negotiators are trained to deescalate situations by “calmly containing the scene, waiting for back up and buying time” while talking to the subject, without placing handcuffs on them and taking them into custody. Police officers are being trained to engage these people in crisis by “slowing things down” and “listening and communicating” with PWMI. They are being trained to establish a rapport with the PWMI and come to a peaceful resolution. The purpose of the training is not only to accomplish these things, but to shed the stigma that PWMI are always violent and there is no hope to reason with them. Furthermore, CIT and stigma are related because Crisis Intervention Training is positively impacted the stigma surrounding PWMI. This type of training not only further educates law enforcement about having the ability to peacefully engage PWMI with the training skills of listening, communication, patience and safety, but it also educated society that CIT is occurring nation wide and further sheds the stigma involving PWMI. The more we educate law enforcement, including society about these stigmas, the more we increase the odds that these stigmas will be minimized or eliminated altogether."
1820,"  In the article by Sema A. Taheri, “Do Crisis Intervention Teams Reduce Arrests and Improve Officer Safety?” discusses the purpose of CIT’s were to minimize the stigma that follows PWMI and to get these individuals to necessary treatment programs that could potentially prevent them from being arrested and minimize the amount of officers who are injured as a result of their interaction with a PWMI. The ultimate purpose of CITs was to “reduce arrests” involving PWMI, “reduce officer use of force” and “reduce injuries to civilians and police officers.” The article concluded that some of the effects of CITs did not just impact PWMI by minimizing their arrests and officer safety, but CITs also spent less time concluding each incident and minimizing stigma for PWMI. Taheri (2016) supports CITs resulted in positive outcomes from the collaboration made between police officers and PWMI. The research supported the police officers who were trained on Crisis Intervention were positively impacted by the specialized training and were able to recognize PWMI symptoms and behaviors in addition to properly addressing the situation involving a PWMI. Although according to Taheri (2016), the studies were limited and the effectiveness of CITs is not supported by additional research, I suggest we continue to provide Crisis Intervention Training and continue to further develop CIT models for PWMI. I agree with Taheri’s statement, “No one could be against encouraging education for officers.” In my opinion, training law enforcement on what defines mental health illness and the behaviors and demeanors they should anticipate from individuals who suffer from mental illness, is only going to make them better police officers. They are going to recognize the behaviors a lot sooner upon contact with a PWMI and do some of the things indicated in this week’s lecture and readings about deescalating the situation, speaking calmly with PWMI, communicating with them as they attempt to establish a rapport and not handcuffing them as they wait for back-up. Police officers can only enhance their knowledge and abilities when dealing with PWMI if we continue to develop CITs. We owe it the PWMI that we educate our officers to perhaps understand them just a little bit more when they are dealt with in the field and we out it to our police officers that we provide them with the education and tools that sets them up for success when dealing with PWMI. Everyone benefits"

1822,"Hi Briana, You and I shared the same thoughts about Crisis Intervention Teams and training despite the conclusions indicated in Taheri’s article. I agree with you that we need to continue to provide police officers with further education and training about PWMI. I also believe that this will only enhance the odds that arrests involving PWMI are reduced, in addition to officers using force on PWMI and being injured. I also agree with your thoughts as indicated in your post that the more people are educated about PWMI, not just police officers, the sooner we can shed the “stigma” that surrounds PWMI. Just as you addressed in your post, I too expressed the importance of police officers, who are the first to engage PWMI, are trained and educated on how to deescalate situations. In addition to establishing communications with the PWMI (enough to develop a rapport with them) and having the ability to simply talk to the PWMI until back-up arrives so that they do not have to immediately handcuff the subject and escalate the situation. I see that we both recognized that although there was not overwhelming research to support CITs work 100%, based on what we learned in this week’s lectures, videos and readings, CITs and crisis intervention training will benefit everyone. Not only will the training benefit the PWMI, because they will be understood a whole lot better, but it will also benefit law enforcement. Police officers will also gain additional training, which will further educate them about PWMI and their anticipated behavior and increase their ability to interact with PWMI. Ultimately, with the hopes of concluding critical situations involving PWMI with a positive outcome."
1823,"Hi Alysse, You and I shared the same thoughts about Taheri’s findings. You make a great point about the Taheri meta-analysis concluding that there was no evidence to support there was meaningful results on the amount of officer use of force and arrests rates. I think we both agree that although the results were not promising, we should continue to provide CIT training to police officers and perhaps improve the training. As indicated in this week’s video lectures and training, I think it is important that we prioritize the further development of mental health training and CITs. For instance, how the state increased the requirement of hours involving mental health training for police officers. I too recognize the examples you provided that could burden the further development of the CITs and additional mandatory training. You are right that this simply comes down to funding and resources. However, I agree with your thoughts that it is necessary to have CITs and implement them on a larger scale. This is the only way we can continue to expand the awareness and training. I was also disappointed in Taheri’s findings, but although the research does not 100% support the effectiveness of further mental health training and the development of CITs, it does not contradict it. At the end of the day, incidents as the one we saw in the video lecture with the PWMI being shot are consistently occurring around the world. We need to continue to try and prevent these incidents. It cannot be wrong, negative or a bad idea to train law enforcement and society all together about the behaviors involving PWMI, because it can only help conclude the situations with a positive outcome. Whether law enforcement understands PWMI better enough to deal with them in a safer manner or we as society understand them better enough to accept them in our daily, lives, it can only prevent PWMI from being injured or arrested, or the shedding the stigma they carry. It is a “win-win” for everybody. You also made an excellent point at the end of your post! I agree there should be more research on this so that perhaps we could eventually be provided with some statistical evidence that supports mental health training and CITs do work. Great post!"
1824,"After watching this video lesson and video interview with the Cook’s County Sheriff, I realized it must be very frustrating for someone who is mentally ill, as well as the jail officials, to have PWMI just keep coming in and out of jail. It must be overwhelming for these individuals who go to jail between 50-400 times, to not make any progress on the root of their problem, which is balancing their illness with therapy, treatment and/or medication. The video and this week’s lesson support there are simply minimal to no resources for PWMI in the criminal justice system (jails & prisons) and these people are not obtaining the mental health attention they need to live normal lives. This must be not only frustrating for them, but harmful for their well-being. The video of the inmates acting out in their jail cells and all of the PWMI inmates waiting to be treated was very disturbing. It is obvious these PWMI not only are going through their mental health issues, but suffer anxiety from not being treated. Although PWMI commit crimes and should be held accountable for them by the criminal justice system, PWMI are probably even more frustrated for not having the resources they need. The video clearly demonstrates how PWMI are not fit be incarcerated with other regular inmates with healthy minds and who do not require such resources and attention. PWMI should be incarcerated if they commit crimes, but they should also be assessed and evaluated for their mental health issues. They should be issued treatment and/or medication so that they are not sent back into the community unstable. This could prevent PWMI from committing so much crime, despite the pettiness, and prevent them from hurting someone, which could end up costing the state much more than investing in mental health resources. I can only assume PWMI do not like going to jail over and over, especially if they are not being provided with the mental health resources they need. Even though PWMI may not truly understand the fact that they are in and out of jail, I can only imagine that they feel a sense of hopelessness and no incentive or motivation to get better. The Sheriff made a good point that they are probably committing crimes such as thefts and burglary to eat and find a place to sleep."
1825,"As indicated in the video lesson, indicators can be something as simple as a “check engine light or temperature gauge” alerting you that there could be some significant issues with the engine in your vehicle. Indicator examples are also the “low battery” indication on your phone that reminds you the battery on your cell phone is low, which indicates you have a limited amount of time to use your phone. Indicators can also provide information about the economy by analyzing unemployment rates. The can tell us about our population by indicating rates involving the homeless, people with high/low education and income. Indicators give us a way to “measure and compare” issues and provide evidence to support our efficiency or needed progress. The three key indicators are the hospital measure and monitor quality of care (HSMR), long term care (measure and monitor use of antipsychotics) and regions (determine the effectiveness of smoking cessation). The two key indicators that I feel jail should measure about mental illness is the “hospital measure and monitor quality of care” and “long term care.” The reason I believe these are the two significant indicators is because jails, of all facilities, should use the “measure / monitor of quality care” and “long term care” to determine what treatment, therapy, medication and overall resources are doing for the mentally ill and which of these should be extended for long periods of time. Just as the “check engine” light tells us we need to take our vehicle to the auto shop, the type of mental health care that is actually being provided to PWMI, should be the indicator on what type of mental health treatment the PWMI has obtained, the quality of the treatment, if the treatment has made a positive impact on the PWMI and if it should be continued. The treatment, whether it is short term during a mandatary institutionalized period (i.e. W&amp;I 5150 – 72 hour mental health evaluation) or long-term (i.e. incarceration for a crime), the mental health care that was provided during the “short term or long term” should be analyzed as an indicator for successful treatment. After learning what I learned in this week’s video lesson, I believe jails should recognize obvious indicators about mental illness to assess PWMI entering the criminal justice system. I think this is the only way PWMI have a chance to benefit from mental health treatment in jail and having the opportunity to mental stability.   </st"
1826,"I think jail inmates are given too many rights. The reason I believe this is because it does not make sense to me that someone who commits a crime and incarcerated for committing crimes, is automatically entitled to certain services. Inmates have the automatic right to be provided with medical and psychological treatment, medication, education benefits, food and shelter, free of cost. Unlike the average law abiding citizen, they do not have to pay for these benefits and resources. These rights, which some truly are privileges (extensive medical care and education), are free to them verses someone who lives in the real world and has to pay for all of these benefits with their own insurance and/or working money. According to this week’s video lesson, in the case  Estelle v. Gamble (1976), the U.S. Supreme Court agreed inmates have health treatment rights per their eighth Amendment. The medical treatment is not only for health illnesses but also for mental health illness. There are people who work, and their employers do not provide medical insurance, not even a working citizen is entitled to those type of benefits. Additional case law such as  Ruiz v. Estelle established additional laws favoring inmate rights. This case established minimal standards for inmates providing them with medical screening and evaluations, suicide prevention and treatment and assessing the appropriate use of their medication. Non–criminal people do not have the luxury of getting these types of services for free. Even people who receive free health care are held to the responsibility of requesting medical/mental health treatment including medication. They are subject to completing paperwork, providing income and living circumstances proving they are in need and are subject to waiting periods. I get these things are done to balance “due process and safety needs of the institution” per the video lesson this week, but again, it just does not seem right that someone who commits a crime has extended rights such as having medical expenses covered, with no obligation to reimburse the cost in any form, including working it off at jail. This right alone seems enough to say that inmates have to many rights in jail. This week’s video lesson also indicated that inmates lose some of their constitutional rights such as the liberty of freedom and right to bear arms, but ultimately do not lose other freedoms such their freedom of speech, freedom of religion"
1827,"I think although medication costs consume a large percentage of jail budgets, I think it is the most common form of treatment for PWMI in jails because as indicated in the video lesson, not only is psychotropic medication the “most common form of treatment” in jail, but most of the times it is the “only” form of treatment for the inmates. Therefore, the fact that there is no other forms of treatment, the jail has no choice but to continue to provide medication to control, stabilize and manage an inmate’s behavior. Specifically when inmates come into the jail with existing mental health issues, disturbing behaviors, including symptoms involving episodes of bipolar, manic, anxiety or depression. A primary goal for the jail staff is to manage the behavior of these inmates. Although according to the video lesson, there could sometimes be other treatments such as Telepsychiatry and psychotherapeutic treatment (therapy for alcohol/drug abuse), the resources are limited and the jails have to result to the medication. Most jails also conduct the suggested screening process called the jail triage three stage process. This screens the inmates upon entry for mental health issues and they are psychologically evaluated. If these inmates need mental health treatment (which can include necessary and immediate medication) for mental stability so they can placed in a jail environment or ultimately be released back into the community, the reality is that the jail has no choice than to provide treatment. Not only because of the safety issues for the prisoner, other inmates or the community if released, but because of the several case laws indicated in our prior video lesson. These cases gave inmates specific rights involving mental health treatment, including necessary medication. Furthermore, the state mandates the jails provide specific health care to inmates, and if resources are limited which do not allow them to provide psychiatrists and therapist who are also high costing professionals, then all they can do is resort to medication, which although is just as costly, it is probably a lot more easy to obtain."
1828,"The use of jails for the seriously mentally ill is not appropriate for funding, architectural and operational constraints. First, according to this week’s video lessons/lectures, Chapter 7 of the text, and Torrey et al., (2010), the funding available for mental health care in our jails is clearly not appropriate or enough. There is simply not enough funding to provide proper mental health treatment for PWMI who may not only need medication to stabilize them, but additional resources to further evaluate their mental health status with official therapy, ongoing treatment and assessments. PWMI need more than the temporary fix provided by psych medications so that perhaps they can get to a place where they can live normal lives. This week’s lecture/reading material, including Torrey et al., (2010) support the state has had to make budget cuts specifically in the jails due to the overcrowding caused by law changes including Prop 47, which changed felony crimes to misdemeanor crimes, and AB109 Realignment that transferred supervision to parole and probation for non-violent prisoners, both of which caused felony type prisoners to enter the local jail system to serve their sentences. Second, the architectural and operation constraints are not appropriate because the mentally ill belong in mental health facilities, not jail facilities. PWMI need to be housed where they can obtain the proper mental health treatment, therapy, medication and any other resource to help stabilize them or set them up for recovery, including initial mental health evaluations and assessments upon entry to the mental health facilities. As indicated in the video involving the Cook’ County Sheriffs Department who housed the largest number of inmates who have mental illness, “jails” are becoming today’s “insane asylums.” However, jails unlike insane asylums are not fit to house such individuals. The only reason the use of jails is appropriate for the mentally ill is for those who commit crimes. People who violate the law and commit both misdemeanor and felony crimes, despite how petty, should be held accountable. However, although they have committed crimes, they are mentally ill people and should also be entitled to some mental health resources, to protect them and other inmates in jail. There should be jails that have the resources such as those in insane asylums that are more appropriate to house the seriously mentally ill, but they should be considered jails for the purp"
1829,"Hi Elise , You and I recognized the same issues of how the use of jails for the seriously mentally are not appropriate for given funding, architectural and operational constraints. I too mentioned in my post that although the jail conditions for the mentally ill are atrocious, according the video example in this week’s lesson, they are also necessary for PWMI who commit crimes. I perceive from your post that you too believe that even though the jail conditions are not appropriate for PWMI, jail is necessary for these individuals who commit crimes, despite their mental health status. I think we both agree that the root of the problem is for jails to have appropriate mental health resources and housing for PWMI. The jails should be suitable for PWMI criminals and not simply serve as “insane asylums” that just house these individuals where they just exist and are not stabilized through medication, therapy or ongoing treatment. You also recognized as I did that AB109 Realignment in California impacted the housing in jails and caused overcrowding, which ultimately cut the budgets in the jail system. The cuts were targeted at the resources involving mental health. I also agreed with your statement in your post that Realignment caused numerous PWMI to enter the jail system, which overcrowded them, and therefore increased the need for mental health treatment. This caused resources to be limited and services were just no longer available for the PWMI who entered the jail system. I also completely agreed with our thoughts that constitutional rights such as the eighth amendment could be violated because of the unavailable funding for necessary care. However, I think because of these constitutional rights, including the eighth amendment and case laws that have been established as you indicated in Estelle v. Gamble, obligate the jail systems and the government to do what they need to do to ensure these rights are not violated, despite the budget/financial situation. You make a great point that police officers need to be trained on assessing mental health issues in PWMI, so they can refer them to mental health professionals’ verses arresting them. However, the reality is that PWMI are committing crimes and end up in jail. I think we both agree that the root of the problem is to make the resources available to PWMI when they are in jail and our jails are suitable for PWMI."
1830,"Hi Briana, After reading your post and others, I concluded you, along with most of our classmates, agree that AB109 Realignment caused overcrowding in jail. According to most of our post, most of us agreed that Realignment caused budget cuts that targeted the resources involving mental health services. You brought up a great point that not only do jails not have insufficient funding, but they are also operating with limited personnel (jails staff). As indicated in the video lesson this week, which you also clearly recognized, jails made so many budget cuts that cell blocks were closed because there was not enough staff to mandate the cells in certain wings of the jail. You made a good point (and issue I had not considered or discussed in my own post) that expenses to the county and state not only stem from the mental health treatment, therapy and medication PWMI inquire in jail, but also from lawsuits that can be generated from inmates who feel their civil rights were violations. I also recognized that PWMI, who are repeat offenders, are obviously going to generate higher expenses because they will be in and out jail and going through the same repeated treatment, assessment and evaluations. Most of these repeat offenders will go through the same intake “triage” assessments and evaluations, which do not change much from the last time they were arrested. This not only waste time, but also the resources that could be allocated for a new person making entry into the jail or mental health system. I agree with your final statement that at the end of the day, jail is sometimes the only “source of treatment for PWMI.” Therefore, concluding that some resources for mental health treatment is better than no treatment that ensures the safety of the inmate, other inmates or the community, should the PWMI be released right back into the community."
1831,"Despite risk assessment tools not being 100% accurate, I think it is fair to use them when assessing offenders. People who commit crimes go in front of judge for their punishment (sentences that result in fines, community service, probation or parole), expect leniency on their sentence. They desire the opportunity to serve their sentences with minimal jail time, house arrest options that only require wearing a monitor as they serve their sentence outside of jail (as demonstrated in the video lesson), and/or released on probation or parole supervision. Offenders want to have ability to serve their debt to society, with the freedom of being out in the community. If these options are something, they want the legal system to consider, then their criminal history should be a factor of having to determine if they deserve the freedom to serve their punishment while still being out in society. As indicated in this video lesson and stated by Judge Robinson, pre-sentence assessments are a comprehensive report of the person’s biography. These reports provide thorough information a person’s “criminal history, their jobs status, other offenses the person has committed, the impact of the crime(s) have had on others, the possibility of providing restitution to their victims, the probability of rehabilitation, and significant sentencing guidelines.” All these elements are important when trying to assess the probability of this person re-offending under supervised conditions. Assessments are conducted by probation / parole officers who are experts in these individual’s behaviors. As demonstrated in the video, they are engaged in the offenders’ lives and know a lot about them. Probation/parole officers are the people who deal with offenders on a consistent basis because their purpose is to rehabilitate them, and they are the officials who can attest to their progress or derailment of while they are in the supervised program. Although these assessments are not always correct, as Judge Robinson indicated in her interview, judges like her and the criminal justice system rely on the reports of these assessments for sentencing and determining if these offenders should be placed back into the community, unsupervised or not. Therefore, although they are not always correct, it is worth utilizing them for the sake of the community’s safety."
1832,"I do not think mental health professionals would be very receptive about the RNR approach with PWMI in the justice system. There are three philosophies RNR is evolved around. It concentrates on intervention with the higher offenders because focusing on low risk offenders can lead to harming the offenders. It also emphasizes on the offender’s “criminogenic” needs, which are the dynamic risk factors that can be changed and affords services/treatment that pertain to the ability/learning capabilities of the offender, where “cognitive behavioral techniques” are used frequently. Mental health professionals are all about preventive measures, intervention and providing services to PWMI to prevent these individuals from committing crimes and entering the criminal justice system. They have a vested interest in evaluating, assessing and making recommendations for the suggested treatment that RNR will restrain them from doing. To explain, there is numerous research we have been exposed to in Chapters 1-7 of the text, including video lectures and readings that support PWMI are not as violent as perceived by society. The stigma that PWMI are violent is what makes every day people think they are harmful, dangerous and high-risk offenders. If the research is true, and PWMI are assessed based on this statistical information, then the reality is PWMI would rarely be determined “higher offenders” and deprived services per the RNR approach. Mental health professionals could perceive RNR as just another way to deprive PWMI the services/mental health treatment they should be entitled to obtain. RNR could be perceived as another obstacle for PWMI that should receive mental health evaluations as preventive measures to either stabilize their mental condition or bring them back to some type of emotional and mental stability. Again, because mental health professionals are all about providing intervention, services, treatment, therapy and medication to PWMI, the odds of them favoring a process that goes against what their careers are evolved around, are slim to none that they will be supported."
1833,"According to interview with Chief Probation Officer Mack Jenkins, “rehabilitation” is what probation is all about. The purpose of probation it to rehabilitate offenders so they can be placed back into the community with the most probability that they will not reoffend. As indicated in the video, if offenders are placed on probation versus going to jail to serve a sentence, they are given a chance to continue to enjoy their freedom outside of jail (out in society), but with certain rules and supervised by a probation officer. Chief Jenkins supports that probation officers facilitate “behavioral change” and therefore I assume his philosophy pertains to all probationers, including the probationers with mental illness.   According to this week’s video lesson, probation concentrates on rehabilitation and provides specific treatment, such as drug-counseling and training to improve job skills. They also expect the probationer to report to the probation office, maintain a job and not relocate from their current residence. I think if anyone is fit to ensure PWMI are obtaining necessary treatment / mental health services, it is truly best through probation. A probation officer is assigned to a probationer, and has consistent contact with them whenever they desire. Their job includes monitoring their probationer, ensuring they are abiding by the terms and conditions of probation, and could also include their probationer is obtaining the necessary mental health treatment to keep them stabilized. Although according to the video, federal funding was limited, probation remains to be focused on rehabilitation and therefore I believe they will continue to further develop their resources for PWMI. Based on the statics provided in the video (in California at least 400,000 people are on probation), probation is cost effective and it only costs $1500 to facilitate a probationer, vs. $50,000 to house them in jail. With that being said, I perceive there is extra government funding that can be allocated to accommodate additional funds specifically for probationers with mental illness. I think the odds of a PWMI obtaining necessary mental health treatment and therapy while being on probation are a lot higher than obtaining them in jail. As indicated in last week’s video lecture and readings, medication is the primary source of “treatment” for PWMI in jail and the funding / resources appeared significantly limited compared to those available throu"
1834,"If I were a PWMI and a participant in mental health court (assuming I understood the circumstances), I would be grateful for the opportunity being subject to mandatory treatment vs. going to jail for committing a crime. I would be grateful and prefer to pay my debt to society, by having to be subject to mandatory psychological treatment, evaluations, assessments or therapy. I would feel privileged to have resources and treatment available to me for the purpose of trying to get me help and stabilize my condition even after the fact I had just committed a crime, despite the petty offense, let alone a more serious one. I would hope to understand and be thankful that if I was on the street and homeless such as Ms. Sanders in the video, the opportunity for these free treatment services would not exist. I also would prefer mental health court vs. traditional court because mental health court would concentrate on trying to get me help for my mental health illness that is causing me to commit crimes and being involved with the criminal justice system. As indicated in the video, the “traditional” criminal justice system is going to focus on bringing justice to the crime that was just committed, despite a person’s mental health status (even people who plead not guilty by reason of insanity, are subject to the criminal court process, such as trial, testifying and potentially being found guilty and sentenced to jail/prison). Unlike mental health court that is going to focus on trying to “sentence” the PWMI with mandatory mental health treatment. Again, I would prefer mental health court because the reality is that it focuses on supporting every aspect of a PWMI life, including their living situation and personal needs. I would prefer this court because it allows PWMI to have the liberty to live outside of jail, in the community, with simple conditions of getting the mental treatment they need. This opportunity is not common with the traditional justice system."
1835,"The guidance I would give to the Chief Probation Officer about supervision with probationers with PWMI is to officially document every resource they are provided with, in addition to their progress from each service. I would advise probation officers specifically document the psychological / psychiatric assessments, evaluations, therapy on their PWMI probationers, including the time spent on these resources, the impacts (good, bad, or indifferent) and results. They should document all this information on their caseloads for the purpose of creating current research that is directly generated from the probation/parole agencies who are providing these mental health resources for the purpose of minimizing repeat offenders. As indicated in this week’s video lessons and readings, probation is all about rehabilitation and there should be current research to support what probation is doing for their PWMI probationers. There should be current information on what mental health services probation is providing their PWMI probationers, to determine if there has been an impact on these repeat offenders. It is important probation continues to develop consistent empirical research involving PWMI and the things that truly keep them in or out of the criminal justice system. As indicated in Skeem et al., we should not rely on the latest “evidence” on whether or not mental health treatment is effective in reducing recidivism by relying on the research already out there from the “psychiatric” point of view, which as indicated in the article, “have shown to improve clinical outcomes for people with mental illness” or from the “corrections” advocates that indicates “the correctional services have shown to reduce recidivism for offenders.” There should be unbiased and the most current research that does not side with the mental health professions or corrections so it can be more credible and reliable. I would also recommend to the Chief that their probation officers develop stricter guidelines for their probationers from obtaining resources. Just as criminal offenders who do not suffer from mental illness eventually no longer have the option to participate in community services vs. paying finds or going to jail, being on monitored house arrest vs. serving their sentence in jail/prison or having the option to be placed on probation or released on parole where they can finish off their sentences out in society vs. being incarcerated. Probation, despite th"
1836,"Hi Stephanie, You brought up some excellent points about the recommendations you made for the Chief. Although, I failed to recognize the consideration about the probation officer’s qualifications, I completely agreed with your thoughts that the probation officer should have specialized training in mental health. I agree that a mental health trained probation officer is going to have a better understanding on how to supervisor, monitor, assess and ultimately provide the most appropriate resources and treatment for their probationer. The more the probation officer could understand about PWMI, the better they are going to interact and know what their probationer needs. I also agree with your thoughts that they should assess whether the probationer suffers from substance abuse and plan to monitor and address that issue as well. As you indicated, the Skeem article points out that if a PWMI also suffers from substance abuse, this will only make them someone who will be even more likely to commit crime and potentially also violent crimes. I agree with you that PWMI also need to be treated from these issues because this could prevent their substance abuse progress and impact their illness in a negative way. You and I both recognized that a key thing would be to generate not only more research on the RNR model, but current research that is going to support what truly keeps these individuals out of the criminal justice system. I felt and addressed in my post that there should be new research that is conducted and provided by professionals without bias to the psychiatric or corrections point of view, so that the research could be more credible and reliable. As indicated in Skeem et al. 2015, we cannot accurately determine what is truly working when the mental health professionals simply produce studies that favor psychiatric help and law enforcement/corrections simply produce the criminal justice system reduces crime. We absolutely need unbiased research and studies to help assess and prevent recidivism among PWMI."
1837,"Please read this as my post, I accidently saved without the beginning portion of my post. According to this week video lecture and specifically the article by Skeem et al. (2015), the risk-needed-responsivity (RNR) model’s purpose is to concentrate on affording “correctional” treatment services to minimize repeat offenders. It is focused on law enforcement efforts to minimize crime, incarceration time, and the costs that are inquired from these individuals when they are involved with the criminal justice system. Even though advocates do not support preventing intervention that concentrates on public health goals, “reducing symptoms and improving functions” the further development of the RMR method has guided to the non-importance of typical research based on mental health practices for these people. Because of this, the guidance I would give to the Chief Probation Officer about supervision of the PWMI on probation is to officially document every resource they are provided with, in addition to their progress from each service. I would advise probation officers specifically document the psychological / psychiatric assessments, evaluations, therapy on their PWMI probationers, including the time spent on these resources, the impacts (good, bad, or indifferent) and results. They should document all this information on their caseloads for the purpose of creating current research that supports their model to reduce recidivism works effectively.  This research could be directly generated from the probation/parole agencies who are providing these mental health resources for the purpose of minimizing repeat offenders.

1838,"Hi Elise , You and I were on the same page and had similar thoughts that the root of the problem is there is just not enough research to support the RNR model completely works to reduce recidivism. We also agreed that there basically needs to be, not only more research on this subject, but current studies that support treating mental illness does impact the probability of PWMI will offend and prevent them from becoming involved with the criminal justice system. I agree with your statement that there is simply a “lack of research”, which could make it difficult for anyone, including the professionals to determine how to appropriately address the PWMI, in and out of the court or jail. I also agreed with your statement about probation should be stricter on their probationers. I too discussed this specific issue in my post. I felt that if PWMI refused to take advantage of some of the resources they were offered, such as mental health treatment vs. jail, and they consistently refused it, then they should eventually not be offered any other options besides going to jail (i.e. community services/find vs. jail, house arrest vs. jail incarceration, probation/parole vs. jail/prison). I also felt that if PWMI had stricter rules on when and if they were offered resources (limited and determined by number of offenses) then maybe they would take advantage of the instead of passing them up. As indicated in this week’s video and readings, probationers who do not suffer from mental illness have standards placed on them by their probation officers. They are subject to maintaining jobs, remaining drug free, not moving from their homes to be monitored and visited at any time. Probationers who suffer from mental illness should have the similar restrictions, including having to go to therapy, being psychologically evaluated and taking medication. If probationers who suffer from mental illness fail to follow those rules, they should not have the privilege of obtaining mental health treatment vs. going to jail. They should be treated like normal probationers, held to the same standard, held accountable by serving jail time just like everyone else."
1839,"After viewing the video involving the prison documentary, I think what could aggravate the condition of a person with mental illness is how the PWMI is treated when they are being combative, uncooperative and disobedient in prison. As shown in the video clip, the prison guards get dressed in different gear and approach the cell, prepared to extract the PWMI inmate from their cells. Someone with mental illness could perceive the different gear (perhaps they are not mentally use to seeing on a daily basis) as challenging and/or intimating, which could negatively affect the inmate mentally even more. The different clothing and aggressive approach, could make the PWMI inmate develop thoughts that tell them the officers are there to hurt them. Also, as shown in the video clip where an inmate was not going with the program, and ultimately was extracted from his cell by officers, the extraction is violent and not conducted in a calm manner. This alone I think is going to aggravate the inmate more and potentially become even more aggressive. I recognize that sometimes these extreme measures are warranted because of the inmate’s behavior and the possibility of the inmate physically assaulting the prison guards, but the bottom line these actions are aggressive and violent, and they could easily agitate the inmate even further. These actions could not only lead to further combative and uncooperative behavior by an inmate with mental illness. Furthermore, the fact that inmates are stripped from their clothes, which invades their privacy and dignity, although they are PWMI, they may understand that they are being degraded and paraded around the jail naked. That could be extremely invasive for anyone, despite their mental status. If I were a PWMI in prison and was stripped of my clothes after an episode as the one shown in the video clip, despite my mental illness, this would increase my anxiety and would make me ever more upset because my naked body was being exposed to everyone. I truly did not see the necessity of this, I would think people could simply be searched to ensure they were not armed with weapons and their clothing remain on their person assuming it was not an item they could use to harm themselves (such as shoe laces that could be used to choke themselves or others)."
1840,"After viewing the video, I do not think it is possible for us to truly rehabilitate prisoners with mental illness because as indicated by both professionals, Meredith Allison, a mental health professional and Craig Thomas a district attorney, the bottom line is that although resources are provided to people with mental illness, the reality is there no one to enforce whether or not they take the recommended treatment, therapy and/or medication they need. An inmate who is screened upon entry of the jail/prison system, is psychologically evaluated and it is determined what their mental health needs are. However, that inmate has the ultimate decision to take the recommended treatment or not. Therefore, the issue will always remain that there is that possibility that inmates refuse treatment and there is nothing we can or will be able to do to rehabilitate them. In addition, we will always be dealing with the significant factor of funding. There will always be an issue about the amount of money that comes in to play with all the resources PWMI are provided both in and out of jail. According to the video, funding to support PWIM and their needed treatment, such as therapy and medication is always going to be an issue. There is not enough funding to not only facilitate prisoners with mental health needs, but also have sufficient state officials/staff in place to enforce that they obtain the suggested treatment. At the end of the day, PWMI, will have the choice to obtain necessary mental health treatment to stabilize them or potentially rehabilitate them. As much as we would like to assume that PWMI are ready and willing to accept resources, as indicated in this week’s lectures and videos, including last week’s video lectures on mental health court, there is always going to be those individuals that refuse treatment and do not take advantage of the services available to them. Because treatment lies in the hands of the PWMI vs. the state and society, I simply believe because these individuals have the right to refuse treatment, they will. I do not believe we will truly ever have the authority to ensure these individuals are mandated to obtain treatment that could potentially stabilize them or rehabilitate them."
1841,"After viewing the video of the male who was in solitary confinement for 5 years, I only believe the only advantage for him to be placed in solitary confinement was to protect other inmates from him, since according to the video lessons, inmates are placed in this type of confinement if they are “deemed a threat to society” or are a danger to the “safety of others.” The only reason I see this as an advantage that outweighs the disadvantage of the inmate is because it protects the safety of the “main prison population” including the prison guards and medical staff. This is assuming the inmate is someone who needs this type of isolation. In other words, the advantage being, the prison is safeguarding numerous inmates and staff vs. just one person who is at disadvantage by suffering during the isolation. Although, I agree with safeguarding numerous people vs. one person, and the advantages of ensuring the safety to others outweighs the disadvantage of that one inmate, it also just did feel right to put someone who is not truly a danger to others through this type of isolation. For example, the video lesson indicated people need “touch and social interaction” in order to be psychically healthy and being isolated prevents that from occurring. People such as Bret Collins who narrated the video and shared his experience, discussed how he was not a violent person and was known to be a “gentle” person. However, he was placed in isolation. In this case without knowing more circumstances, it just does not feel right to disregard his wellbeing, for the sake of maintaining order in the jail. Mr. Collins described all of the negative things he went through while being in solitary confinement. He said he would start feeling anxiety, his body and head were physically affected, and that he experienced paranoia, anxiety and shaking when he would lay on the floor to de-stress himself. All of these experiences appeared to negatively impact Mr. Collins and it just did not seem worth the consequences to maintain order in the prison. I believe the only true advantage of solitary confinement for maintaining order in the prison system that would outweigh the disadvantages of someone such as Mr. Collins, is if Mr. Collins was a true a danger to other inmates and/or prison staff. At that point, it would be in the prison’s best interest to keep him in confinement, despite his feelings, to prevent him from hurting other inmates, including prison guards and me"
1842,"I am good with my tax dollars being spent on treating the mentally ill in prison as long as it rehabilitates these individuals or keeps them incarcerated if the therapy does not make an impact on their mental health status. I recognize that according to the video, we could spend $22,000 on a PWMI in the prison system vs. $2,200 per individual outside the system. However, if there are PWMI in our prison system, I prefer my tax paying dollars go towards them getting better before being released back into society with these mental health issues. I prefer PWMI are treated in jail, which according to this week video lessons, is the most plausible place they will obtain such services, than release them back into communities unstable with the potential of committing crime or hurting someone. Although, I will be the first to admit that it is a bit frustrating to have my tax dollars pay for services to individuals who did not earn them on merit or by working a job that provides these services, because the fact of the matter is, these individuals are afforded these privileged services after they committed a crime and were sent to jail. However, I prefer these individuals be treated before coming back out into our communities and having the ability to contact everyday people at the grocery store, public libraries, and other social public places where they can potentially interact with the public, including children. I think it is best we do what we can to ensure PWMI are stable and potentially have a resource to rehabilitate if they are going to be free to roam the streets. The reality is that people will continue to encounter PWMI in their everyday life and it is best those PWMI are treated, or those interactions could be bad for everyone. For instance, if PWMI are contacted by the police when they are suffering from psychosis, or are being manic or suicidal, all because they were not provided with necessary medication or therapy, ultimately they can engage the police and the incident could end up with a use of force incident where the PWMI or officers get hurt. It is best we take pro-active measures to attempt to fix the problem, rather than sit back and watch these individuals get worse and potentially continue to commit even petty crimes that end up costing money anyway (arrest, incarceration and court procedures)."
1843,"Prisons can best meet the need to keep inmates and staff safe by continuing to assess and evaluate prisoners upon entry in the jail/prison and continue to provide mental health treatment to PWMI when they determine it is necessary. Based on this week’s video lessons and readings and Chapter 11 text, PWMI that are not treated can act up (just as shown in the video where they inmate was combative and screaming and had to be extracted from his cell). A PWMI that goes through these episodes because they are not treated, only enhances the chance of injuries to the prison guards, medical staff and the inmate themselves, which could lead to even more significant costs involving payouts from resulting lawsuits. Furthermore, if inmates are not psychologically and mentally stabilized, it can lead for the prison to deal with them by using other alternatives such as placing the inmate in solitary confinement. Again, according to the video lesson, this can only worsen the mental status of the inmate and could make things worse when they eventually come out of solitary confinement and they re-enter the main prison population. As indicated in Adams and Ferrandino (2008), jails/prisons are the most practical place where PWMI will obtain mental health treatment. Adams and Ferrandino (2008) also supports that there is a significant amount of PWMI incarcerated in our state and federal institutions and the situation continues to worsen. Because of this reality, psychological/psychiatric mental health treatment can and should continue to be provided to PWMI in jail, while at the same time containing costs by the following ways. First, jail/prison can limit the mental health evaluations and assessments. For example, only conducted initial assessments upon entry into the jail system. They can simply obtain follow up treatment thereafter without having to go through the entire process all over again. Prisons could also reach out to medical/psychology schools and reach out to students to determine if there are students who are willing to do internships in the jails and prisons for the specific purpose of dealing and treating inmates who suffer from mental illness. These interns who are probably just as qualified as official staff, could also further assess/evaluate inmates as well as provide treatment and therapy at no cost for the trade of obtaining hands on training for their PhD’s. The state could save money by using students as the mental health professional"
1844,"Hi Briana, I appreciated reading your post because you made some great points about having separate residential environments for PWMI depending on their initial assessment or evaluation upon entry in the jail/prison. I agree that by having special housing units and distinguishing the difference in the PWMI inmates who are combative, uncooperative or simply go with the program, staffing and resources can be allocated a lot more appropriately. Having separate “living units” vs. units for people with significant mental illness, could allow the jail/prison system to make a more educated assessment on the amount of prison and medical staff they need for each housing units. You made a great point that this could be cost effective by having the ability to shuffle staff around and place them where they are needed the most (with units housed with PWMI that are combative and get out of control vs. inmates who suffer from mental illness, but are calm and passive). I liked your idea about designated medication and treatment for certain diagnoses of the PWMI. You and I had similar thoughts about the use on medication. I also discussed in my post that inmates who were assessed and determined to be a PWMI that should be on medication, they should only medicate the individual when necessary. I assume sometimes when PWMI enter the jail system, they automatically start issuing them psych medication for long-term mental health issues such as bi-polar / schizophrenia, without truly seeing any serious symptoms such as psychosis or mania. Considering the last video lesson discussed one of the most common and costly forms of treatment is medication, perhaps if they securitized its use, there could be an impact in its costs. I also agreed with your position that PWMI should obtain more resources than those who do not suffer from mental illness. You and I shared the same philosophy that ultimately PWMI are the inmates who need these resources and they are a lot easier to obtain inside the jail/prison system than on the outside. I agreed with your statement that “resources should be allocated to treat and rehabilitate to reduce recidivism and costs” but I also felt that the most important thing was that if these individuals are eventually going to be released back into our communities, we should do what we can to stabilize their condition to enhance the chance of them becoming productive members of society."
1845,"Hi Caroline, I appreciated your post because I completely agreed with your statement that “prisons’ number one priority should be to maintain a safe and protected upkeep for staff and inmates.” I agree with your thoughts that there should be an assessment process for PWMI who are known to be combative, uncooperative and those who go with the program. You make a great point that this could be cost efficient because perhaps the prison/jail would not have to staff their jail with as many prison guards if they had an educated assessment of who was entering their jails and the odds of them being a problem. I respect your position and you make a great argument about PWMI not being treated in jail and treated in hospitals. However, the reality is that they are entering the jail system and not a hospital. At that point, if they are entering the jail system with the potential of being released back into the community, I would like to think that person was assessed and provided with some resources to potentially stabilize them rather than roaming the streets unable to function like a normal person and perhaps be a danger to themselves or others. I agree with you that PWMI should be shifted to the mental hospitals rather than jail and perhaps with consistent treatment, either they would be rehabilitate or remain in a mental hospital vs. jail where they may not belong (because they are mentally ill and not criminals). You and I also both recognized that whether the PWMI obtained treatment in a mental hospital or jail, they should receive more resources. I felt they should receive these additional resources in jail/prison because they are the individuals who need these specific mental health services. Like you, I also think the key to rehabilitation is “hand-on care and consistent monitoring.” Great post!"
1846,"Reflecting on the video, if I were a taxpayer in Missouri, I would be pleased to hear about the construction of the new Fulton State Hospital. To begin with the facility was old and built in 1851. I was pleased to hear in the video that Governor Nixon was in full support of ensuring the facility was “safe” which I believe is the most important thing about a facility that houses people with mental illness. It is necessary these types of facilities ensure the safety to the patients, medical staff and security guards assigned to these places. It is also imperative these facilities are updated and secure to ensure the patients cannot escape into the neighboring community that surrounds the facility. I can only assume the rebuilt of the facility improved the security measures with the latest technology of security cameras and automatic doors/gates, etc. This updated technology could eliminate the probability of these individual with mental illness escape into the residential areas surrounding the facility and perhaps end up harming someone who they happen to run into and engage. It is also important that people with mental illness are housed in facilities with good living conditions unlike the past where these facilities were asylums we can describe as cells comparable to cages for animals. Facilities such as Fulton State Hospital should be housed with the latest technology so they can have the ability to provide the best mental health care for PWMI and the goal of stabilizing the mentally ill and intentions to rehabilitate them becomes more plausible. I was pleased to see that the State of Missouri is setting the example for other states to follow their lead. States such as Missouri are demonstrating their commitment of ensuring humane housing conditions, with appropriate treatment, their latest upgrades to their facility with the latest technology so that future facilities can invest in the same for the sake of enhancing the probability of rehabilitation to PWMI."
1847,"Prior to viewing this video lesson, I would have described pleading “Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity” as a “Get out of Jail Free Card.” However, after viewing this week’s video, people who are found “guilty by reason of insanity” I recognize are not necessarily getting out of being incarcerated or serving a lifetime sentence. According to this week’s lesson and videos, someone who pleads insanity and is found “not guilty”, is not set free. They are typically sent to a mental health hospital and must be consistently evaluated and treated so they can ultimately be determined “cured.” If a PWMI is treated and determined to be “cured” than that is the only way they could be released back into society. According to this week’s lessons, PWMI who are found “not guilty” by reason of insanity, typically are not released from jail and either serve a lifetime sentence or are treated for their illness behind bars, without ever getting out. I guess if you consider lifetime mental health treatment in an institutionalized environment where a person does not have the liberty to be released as “confinement” or “jail” than I guess someone would not consider them as “getting out of jail free.” However, if you perceive lifetime mental health care treatment as a privilege vs. punishment such as jail/prison, then it would be like a “getting out jail card.” I do not agree with anyone who commits a crime, not being held accountable for their actions, despite their mental health status. Perhaps that is why I can also side with the thought that people who are considered for insanity pleads are simply getting away with crimes because of their mental illness. In a way that is like indicating “the devil made me do it.” At the end of the day, a crime has been committed, and typically with insanity cases, lives have been lost so the person is dead and there is no turning back from that. The person is gone and part of me believes the suspect should be held accountable, despite being “insane.” However, according to science they did not know any better. I have mixed emotions about “guilty by reason of insanity” cases but after viewing the video lesson, I was able to recognize the perspective that although these people do not serve their life in prison for their actions, they serve them in mental institutions, so they truly are not getting out of jail."
1848,"After viewing the video involving the mental health professions who were assaulted by mental health patients, I believe the state hospitals can best deal with patient and staff safety while providing treatment by ensuring they are properly staffed and provide a safe working environment. The staff members said it themselves that they are unable to provide treatment to patients if they are placed in unsafe environments. Although there were some good points that hospitals are not prisons and should not be run like them, they do need to make sure their staff is safe from being physically assaulted. The fact that there were 96 injuries within 3 years at the facility in the video, is not acceptable. Despite the controversary, if security measures need to be in place to keep staff safe, such as having official security guards with defensive and arrest and control tactic training, then it simply must be done. Hospitals need to provide safe environments by not only having enough staff but also having qualified staff for the job. Having maintenance workers and cooking staff “stand guard” with the patients because they do not have anyone else are short staffed should not be occurring. The state needs to understand that by trying to save money by “doing more with less” and not having enough staff on duty, will just result in the state paying out in lawsuits by medical staff who are physically assaulted by their patients (such as the two nurses in the video who were assaulted). The bottom line, as indicated in the video, in order to provide treatment to PWMI, the medical professionals, including nurses, therapists, or anyone who could possibly interact with the PWMI while they are being treated, needs to not only feel safe, but actually be safe, in order to effectively treat them. The state needs to invest in safety and do what it takes to properly staff these facilities, with qualified staff who is appropriate and competent for the job. Although it may include negative perceptions such as placing security guards in these facilities, it is the right thing to do, to prevent anyone from being hurt, including the patients."
1849,"Reflecting on the video, I want to start by saying I was a bit shocked but not surprised on where we are today with technology and the medical practices currently being worked on these days. I would have never guessed that we could have surgical procedures such as the one illustrated in the video. I was shocked to see how a procedure can manipulate someone’s brain to the extent of Edy Guiden, who suffered from depression most of her life and after this experimental surgery/procedure, her depression issues completely changed. Again, shocked but not surprised of the impact this medical procedure known as Deep Brain Stimulation did for someone like Edy. After viewing this video, as much as it sounds a bit extreme to me, I am all for it. I think if someone suffers from conditions such as depression their entire life, who has tried a variety of medications, including therapy sessions as ways to battle their issues, and still cannot feel even a bit cured, than participating in an experimental procedure that can perhaps cure their symptoms, is something I see nothing wrong with. I believe people have the right to try anything they feel comfortable with, for the sake of trying to find some stability for their mental health status, such as Edy. Edy suffered from depression her entire life and tired everything, including killing herself. I think someone like Edy has every right to try these extreme procedures. I feel we are always going to move forward in modern medicine, and we can only keep on benefiting from the intelligence of doctors such as Dr. Neighbors. Dr. Neighbors has invested her entire life and career to make a difference for someone like Eppy who is suffering every day. I agree with technology making a difference and impacting our lives in positive ways. This is clear example of how technology can only move PWMI forward and potentially find a cure. In the case of Eppy, she went through her entire childhood and early adult life suffering with depression. She was suicidal and according to her interview, nothing worked. It is remarkable to see that this brain stimulation experiment is making a positive impact to her mental health status, so why not continue to experiment with this type of technology, modern medicine and therapy. I would be a bit hesitant to try this myself, but I am all for this for anyone who chooses to do it."
1850,"After viewing this week’s videos and reading this week’s lessons, I think the most important role for state hospitals vis-à-vis the criminal justice system is to have qualified staff, including psychological professionals, medical staff and security guards. There should be enough medical professionals and law enforcement officials in these facilities that ensure a safe working environment for the patients and all the staff in these facilities. According to Stephanie Clendenin, the Director of the Department of State Hospitals, her message in the 2018 Annual Report, indicated their mission is to “make hospitals safer and more caring places for the thousands of patients” they serve yearly. They even have a Workplace Violence Program that quotes “preventing workplace violence is a top priority for DHS.” I completely agree that they should prioritize safety, and I appreciated reading in the article how the Department of State Hospitals used this opportunity to re-evaluate their vision, mission, goals and values to improve their future. It appeared in the article, that part of their vision was to improve workplace safety. According to this article DHS took care of nearly 12,000 patients between 2017-2018. These patients all had serious mental health issues, which usually includes some patients becoming combative with staff members. That is a lot of patients who have the potential of becoming violent for these facilities not to take on safety measures for the working conditions for their staff. There should be enough staff members to deal with these patients, despite their budget goals of saving money. In addition, the staff needs to by qualified for that position. After viewing the interviews by the two employees who were physically assaulted by their patients when they were simply tending to the needs of the patients, it reconfirmed the most important thing in these facilities is the safety provided for the employees. These medical professionals are doing a job that is for the purpose of helping other people. The least the state can do is ensure their safety. These individuals should not have to sacrifice their wellbeing every day they go to work just because the state is being conservative with staffing for the sake of saving money. Qualified personnel should be available to fill in when staff is short-handed. As indicated in the video, having cooks and maintenance workers stand by with patients who could potentially be combative, is unacce"
1851,"Hi Gabriela, I read your post and appreciated your thoughts about what you believe is the most appropriate role for state hospitals. I admit that I did not focus on the ideal “purpose” of these hospitals until I read your post (I derailed to the thought of having “safe” working environments as indicated in the 2018 Annual Report by the California Department of State Hospitals). You made an excellent point and I agree with your statement that state hospitals should “focus on treatment and rehabilitation” of the mentally ill so that these people do not “end up in the criminal justice system.” I do recognize that this should be the purpose, and that rehabilitation should be the goal with PWMI. I agree with you that these facilities should focus on PWMI, not only to get them stabilized and perhaps rehabilitated, but that they prevent PWMI to never step foot in a jail/prison or stand in front of judge in a court room ever again. Again, I simply focused on the safety of these facilities because of what I saw on the video involving the nurses who were injured by their patients. My thoughts and opinions were completely overwhelmed by some of things they discussed. I thought both employees made significant comments about their jobs and what it takes to fulfill them. They discussed how they were unable to perform their duties and treat patients to the best of their ability if they were unable to feel safe at work and ultimately have a safe working environment. I also agreed with your thoughts that state hospitals should be exclusively for forensic patients because I felt since these individuals were being committed to state facilities by the court systems then they should inquire the liability. I did recognize that according to the article by Fisher et al. 2009, it clarified that the SMHA’s ends up responsible for funding the costs, but you made a good point, that regardless of funding, the state hospitals can take advantage of the opportunity to improve their facilities and do what they can to have “better designed, prepared and trained to work with forensic patients.” At the end of the day, I felt that if the state felt the pressure of the increase in number of commitments into these state facilities, they could perhaps re-evaluate the criteria of commitment."
1852,"  Hi Cornise, I am responding to your post because you are another classmate that made me recognize another perspective on what the most important role for state hospitals is. I appreciated your thoughts and statement about “providing the best care possible for patients regardless of their criminal history.” In my post I actually discussed how having a safe work environment was the most important thing because based on the video interviews with the employees who were assaulted, they could not perform their duties in an unsafe environment and they discussed how having a safe work environment was the only way to ensure they could treat their patients properly. I strongly believe that if these medical professionals are walking on eggshells throughout the day, despite their true efforts on treating PWMI, it simply cannot be done. You made a great point that the purpose of these hospitals is to provide mental health treatment to patients, which makes complete sense on why that should be the most significant role for these facilities. I simply was strongly influenced by the staff who was assaulted and insisted safe work conditions were the answer to providing successful treatment to these patients. Again, for me, I just focused on the video and article involving the DHS annual report, which indicated a safe work environment was their priority, and I completely agreed. I agree with your statement that prison may not be the best location for PWMI to obtain mental health resources/treatment, but I think the reality is that this is the most feasible place where they can obtain it. Not only for free without any cost for them, but it is also immediately available upon entry into the jail system. You provided some good ideas about state hospitals not being used exclusively for forensic patients by establishing separate “wings” depending on the status of the patient (i.e. being a danger self/others). I felt that if the criminal justice system was responsible for committing these individuals in state hospitals for not being competent to stand trial as indicated in Fisher et al. 2009, then although the SMHA’s was ultimately financially liable, they should be housed in state hospitals. My thoughts are that if the state feels the hit financially, then maybe they will re-evaluate the criteria of PWMI who are committed."
1853,"I think the essential training for mental health and criminal justice actors to benefit PWMI is training in the understanding of what defines mental illness. Early on in the quarter when we were introduced to mental illness and the stigma that follows both the mentally ill and mental health illness, we were informed that there are a lot of misconceptions about, not only PWMI, but also what it means to suffer from mental illness. It is important mental health and law enforcement professionals are provided training involving all the mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar, depression, anxiety and other psychological development illnesses. They should be trained on the health issues involved with each illness and what causes a person to be manic, aggressive and suicidal. This type of training will lead to a better understanding of what PWMI go through and how to be more companionate and tolerant towards their actions. Mental health and law enforcement professionals should be trained to completely understand why people suffer from mental illness and how each mental health issue is developed or where it comes from. They should also understand the common symptoms and behaviors of each illness and how to recognize the red flags that lead them to believe someone may be suffering from mental illness. I believe this is the first step of knowing what to do and how to help PWMI. Understanding what it means to be mentally ill, how to recognize/diagnose someone who is suffering from mental illness and being competent in knowing what illness they are suffering from, is essential in developing a plan for their rehabilitation. Other essential training should be in how to interact and deal with PWMI. These professionals should be provided with information, guidance and some direction on how to speak, engage and ultimately either treat/evaluate the individual or take them into custody in a peaceful manner. A big part of the people in the mental health profession, including law enforcement, is interacting with PWMI. They are either attempting to assess them during psychological evaluations, treat them with therapy or prescribing medications (situations with mental health professionals) or contacting them in a public setting when the PWMI has drawn attention to themselves (situations involving law enforcement). Therefore, it makes sense that these professionals should obtain training to have a clear understanding on what to do with someone who suffer"
1854,"Hi Elise, You and I had similar thoughts on what is essential for mental health and criminal justice actors to benefit PWMI. I also thought that training in the understanding of what mental illness means and how it is defined was the first step of moving forward with helping PWMI. I too discussed how these professionals should be educated on what defines mental health issues and how to recognize the symptoms of the different type of illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar, depression, anxiety and psychological issues. You and I literally quoted the benefits of this alone would benefit the “interaction” with PWMI, whether it was with the medical health professional or law enforcement professional. You made a great point about further educating these professionals about stigma would provide “the knowledge to understand them.” I agreed with your thoughts that the foundation of making a difference starts with understanding mental health illness and the individuals who suffer from this. I also discussed how further education will not only help the PWMI, but also the professional who engage them. By these professionals being a master of their craft (understanding what defines mental health illness, recognizing symptoms, having the ability to establish a rapport with PWMI and being competent enough to recognize/diagnose the type of illness the individual is demonstrating), they establish not only further credibility in their professional roles, but also have the competency to determine what the PWMI needs and how to obtain the appropriate treatment to stabilize them or rehabilitate them. Again, just like you, I also referred to the video of the officers who responded to the male subject who suffered from mental illness and discussed the benefits of having the CIT officer on scene. The CIT officer had training that specialized in dealing and interacting with PWMI, and he was able to engage the subject by establishing a rapport with him. The CIT officer was trained to speak with the male in a normal conversation with a normal tone of voice that helped him defuse the situation. As you also recognized, this was an excellent example of how extended education and training in understanding PWMI can only help us move forward to the common goal of helping PWMI and the professionals who are placed in these interacting situations. You and I seriously had the exact some thoughts on this discussion!  "
1855,"Hi Caroline, You made a great point in the beginning of your post that there should be specified and expert personnel who should be assigned to respond to calls for service involving PWMI. I agree with you that mental health and law enforcement professionals should have the ability to contact professionals in this field who are experts in dealing with PWMI when those professionals (mental health and law enforcement officials) are not 100% qualified in dealing with PWMI. Everyday professionals my not know what defines mental illness, may not have the ability to recognize mental illness symptoms and or know how to properly interact or deal with PWMI. I agreed with the information you provided pertaining to Dr. Parker regarding mandatory training. The reality is, sometime when it comes to training, unless it is mandatory, most of the time it does not occur. We both agreed that consistent training is what is going to make an impact on these professionals because it will force them to obtain the necessary knowledge and training to better understand PWMI. I also believe this is the only way these professionals will further develop their expertise and confidence to better assess situations and do what is best for PWMI. Based on most of our classmates’ posts, it sounds like we all agree further education and training on understanding how mental health illness is defined, what it consists of and what symptoms and behaviors qualify these individuals as people who suffer from mental illness, is the most significant approach on helping PWMI. According to several of our classmates’ posts, this one of the primary ways to start making a difference in the fight against stigma and negative perceptions about mental illness. Perhaps this is not only the first step, but the best way of making a significant difference when interacting with PWMI and getting them the help, they need."
1856,"According the video, it appears the forms of data sharing are not satisfactory for really understanding the link between the criminal justice system and mental health systems and their clients. As indicated in the video, the study conducted involved the assessment of people who were arrested in Washington DC who also suffered mental illness. The study revealed that of all the agencies who provided their arrest information for one month, about 1/3 of people arrested also suffered from mental illness. Of those individuals who were arrested and suffered from mental health services, 40% of them were not offered or provided mental health resources during/after their arrest. According to Jim Parsons, the Director of Substance and Mental Health Problems, PWMI go through the process quickly and there is not enough time to fully evaluate these individuals to determine if they have mental health issues. Also, because these individuals are processed quickly and they do not have the time to properly assess them, they either fail to disclose their mental health needs to the staff or do not disclose because they are unaware, they have mental health issues. Jim Parsons also indicated the criminal justice and mental health systems have a history of not having a good working relationship and there is a s a lack of information sharing between them. He said because they do not work well together, they fail to let one another know about the needs identified for the PWMI and what resources they should be referred to. According the video, when PWMI are arrested, the system fails to communicate what that individual is going to need, and therefore falls through the cracks and ultimately is not treated. As indicated in the video, the communication between both the criminal justice and mental health systems need improve by having both systems work hand and hand. Parsons made a great point about having someone from the Department of Mental Health on staff in the jails/corrections to ensure they are identifying the PWMI, their needs and resources, including what they will need when they are released. There should be staff members that have a vested interest in both the criminal justice system and the mental health system. For instance, create jobs where correction officers are both qualified psychiatrist/psychologists (with formal education and training) assigned to these details. An employees who is responsible for the dual purpose of ensuring mental healt"
1857,"After viewing the video, the difference in the CIT trained officer approach from a routine law enforcement encounter, is that the CIT officer engaged in conversation with the male vs. coming in and ordering him to sit down or immediately searching him for weapons. The CIT officer asked questions about what was going on with the subject so that the subject would stay focused on communicating with the officers rather than further his agitation.   The CIT officer was not confrontational and simply spoke with the male. He established a rapport with him and was attempting to make the male feel as if he was being listened to. The CIT officer did not attempt to detain the male, place hands or handcuffs on him, and did not verbally command him to sit down. Because I am police officer, I know firsthand that a routine police officer would have approached this situation with officer safety in mind. Routine officers typically would have approached this type of subject, by initially detaining him. This process would include the subject being ordered to sit down or taking hold him, which would be followed by a search of the subject’s person to ensure he was not armed with any weapons. Routine officers typically order these types of subjects to sit down to prevent them from walking/pacing (as the subject in the video) when they conduct their interviews or try and determine what is going on. Because of how police officers are trained, officer safety is the number one priority and routine officers would have focused on just that. Unfortunately, this usually includes immediately searching subjects and detaining them before getting into the investigation and determining what is going on. Routine police officers are trained to make “scenes safe” before conducting investigations. Therefore, in this case, routine officers would have tried to minimize the probability of being assaulted and the subject becoming combative/engaging in a physical altercation by searching him and having him sit down as they spoke with him. The CIT officer did his duty. He engaged the subject through conversation and established a rapport with him so that he could defuse the situation by earning the subjects trust and cooperation through their communication. He relied on his back up officer to ensure their safety and the CIT officer continued to focus on constantly communicating with the subject to put him at ease. The CIT trained officer approach works best for these types"
1858,"I think the reason it often takes a court order or other legal actions for department of corrections to change the way PWMI is because they are re-active vs. pro-active just as so many departments are, including businesses in the private sector. Government agencies including business in the private sector, treat legal issues just as anyone else would in today’s society. It is not a big deal until someone is being sued for an incident where someone was hurt, offended or their civil rights were violated. Whether we are dealing with the public sector such as corrections or police departments, or businesses in the private sector, changes typically do not occur until someone or something forces the issue (i.e. an inmate is injured in a jail, a suspect experience excessive force, an employee is discrimated at work due to their mental health status). The state just like any other business reacts to lawsuits, which leads to implementing change. Unfortunately, it takes someone getting hurt or killed or someone’s civil rights being violated for the state (including the private sector) to attempt to make a difference in their current practices. We saw a great example of this in last week’s lessons involving the Department of State Hospitals where the two nurses were assaulted. The DHS report focused on safe work conditions and that was all they talked about in their report. They even established workplace violence training. It may have been something they were invested in, but after these employees were assaulted, they went above and beyond to publicize what the DHS is doing to improve workplace violence. Their efforts are glorified in their 2018 annual report and they provide detailed information, including the mandatory training their employees are exposed to, in order to convey their dedication to safety. The reality is that most of the time, government agencies and private sector businesses do not seek to fix things until they are forced to through “lawsuits!” Usually being sued is what makes law enforcement and private sector business to make changes. It is almost like the saying “if it aint broke don’t fix it” as in “if you’re not sued, it’s all good!” Again, unfortunately it takes someone suing government entities to implement change. It should not have to come to this, but perhaps that is what they wait for."
1859,"After viewing the video involving the mental health workers, I felt they do in fact deal with many challenges with the correctional environment. The correctional environment is focused an ensuring these individuals serve the time behind bars for the crimes they committed, despite their mental heath status. Bottom line, they are in jail for committing crime and having the option to take advantage of mental health services are simply a privilege they have when going to jail. According to the mental health professionals (health workers), in the video, their focus is “clinical care.” Their priority is to treat PWMI prisoners and help them become stabilized or help them with their recovery. They are focused on ensuring the PWMI obtains the necessary treatment, therapy and/or medication to bring them back to a functional human or perhaps work towards actual recovery. They are not concerned about the PWMI who is incarcerated and following their everyday routine, such as waking up when being told to, eating and bathing as scheduled and simply going along with the daily program that is determined to be a normal day in jail. These medical professionals seek deserved respect from the inmates vs. prisoner guards who can discredit their respect because of how they treat the inmates with mental illness. According to the video lesson, medical professionals truly are concerned with the recovery of inmates who suffer from mental illness. These professionals desire influencing their lives and providing them with a chance to recovery. This could be a challenge when correction officers simply want to maintain order in the jails and with PWMI inmates to provide a safe environment to all inmates, despite their odds of ever recovering. I think it would absolutely help everyone involved, including corrections and medical staff, to be on the same page and have similar goals for the inmates. If medical staff including law enforcement officials are being trained with the same philosophies and strategies to improve the goals involving PWMI inmates, then everyone can strive towards rehabilitating inmates and maintaining order. This is the only way law enforcement (corrections) and the medical professionals could all be on the same page and develop methods to work together and establish the common goal of rehabilitating these individuals to stop re-offending and becoming productive citizens."
1860,"I think diversion efforts such as those in Fairfax, focus on the non-violent offender because their purpose was getting PWMI illness treatment not having them incarcerated. The Sheriff indicated that 40% of her jail population included PWMI and her focus was to get them the treatment they needed to stabilize their illness and perhaps rehabilitate them vs. keeping them in jail where they are not being treated and simply carrying out their sentences. The Sheriff also indicated by breaking the cycle of PWMI committing crime, going to jail and not getting the treatment they need, can be cost efficient because by PWMI getting suitable treatment, it will ultimately lead to them getting the treatment they need and perhaps avoid re-offending and coming back to jail. A good example of why diversion efforts should focus on non-violent offenders is of the male in the video who suffered from mental illness and became a mentor. He was a non-violent offender who they gave the opportunity to go through diversion. This man was a success story who went through a diversion program and was now healthy, a productive member of society, and helping people just like him go through the same diversion programs and obtain the treatment they need. Also, PWMI who are non-violent offenders have the best odds of potentially completing these programs because they have the incentive of obtaining mental health treatment. Typically, non-violent offenders are arrested for petty crimes such as theft. Because these crimes are petty with minimal fines or incarceration consequences, the state should save money and let them participate in a diversion program. Funding should be spent to house inmates who should be incarcerated long term without the opportunity to participate in these diversion programs such as the violent offenders. I think that violent offender should have to serve their sentences as they are issued and not allowed to participate in diversion program. Most violent offenders have been incarcerated multiple times, some of which for legit crimes. These types of individuals do not have the same probability or incentive to complete diversion programs because they simply do not work for them. They have history of being repeat offenders who are not committed to make a change, which is what diversion programs are stemmed to do. We need to invest our government funds for treatment on those who have a high probability of making changes, as the male in the video."
1861,"I think the hurdles are different for the criminal justice and mental health agencies to implementing evidence-based-training because mental health agencies need to rely on scientific research that test effectiveness. The mental health agencies also need to justify their effectiveness by demonstrating their clients are functioning. They use case management, care, mental health treatment, health education, employment and housing assistance and education support to show their effectiveness. Mental health agencies need to demonstrate their treatments are working by providing success stories or disclosing the patients who they did not make a difference with. The criminal justice system does not have the same hurdles in this case. Criminals commit crimes and are subject to legal consequences when it comes to paying fines, serving time in jail or prison or having the opportunity of being released on probation or parole conditions based on their crime. The criminal justice does not treat offenders who go before the court to obtain their sentence from a judge as mental health agencies treat their patients. Criminals are issued punishment where mental health patients are issued treatment. These patients are studied throughout their therapy to determine if the treatment worked or not. The criminal justice does not have the same obligations as mental health agencies because they are not required to follow their “clients” (criminals who go to court to plead their case and wait for the punishment depending on the outcome of their case). Criminals simply get their sentenced and are dismissed to fulfill it.   Unlike the mental health profession who needs to keep long-term documentation to not only substantiate what they do to rehabilitate their clients, but to utilize their practices on future clients to make them better and have a method of treating future patients, the criminal justice system does not need to do that. They criminal justice system does not keep documentation on criminals for the sake of determining if their sentences made an impact on them. These criminals are simply processed through the system when and if they re-enter it."
1862,"I think an integrated mental health and substance abuse model like the one described in the video would change the way the justice system would work with individuals with co-occurring disorders because they would have to start handling criminal offenders who suffer from mental illness and substance abuse together and consider both issues as a reason for them committing crime. The criminal justice system would have to acknowledge the fact that these individuals not only suffer from mental health issues but also substance disorders, which could impact their mind capacity, motives and/or mindset when committing crimes. Not only will the criminal justice system have to consider the PWMI’s state of mind at the time of the crime, but now they would have to consider if they were completely under the influence of a substance enough to not know what they were doing, which could impact the mental competence of committing crime. In other words, the criminal justice system would now not only have to determine if the PWMI committed the offense due to their mental health status but also if they were on some type of substance that impacted their ability to know what they were doing. As Doctor Katheryn Powner indicated in the video, we are now going towards treating PWMI for both their mental illness and substance abuse issues. The latest perception of necessary treatment is for the mental health and criminal justice systems to work together in an integrated care system. This will allow both systems to provide necessary treatment for individuals who not only suffer from mental health issues and also are substance abusers, but also substance abusers who suffer from mental illness. The systems would work together to conquer both illnesses (mental health and substance abuse). It makes sense to offer this dual treatment, considering that according to the video, 8.0 million people experience mental health and substance abuse disorders and less than 40% of them receive treatment. By having both the mental health and criminal justice systems work together and treat both issues at the same time, this could maximize the resources and potentially not only address both issues but also fix the PWMI issues (both mental and substance) at the same time. An integrated system would help both systems better understand treating the person as a whole and immediately consider the possibility that they are suffering from both mental health issues and substance abuse."
1863,"After viewing the video, I feel that peer mentoring would be helpful in addressing stigma of mental illness because as indicated in the video, the mentors can “improve wellbeing” amongst one another and make themselves feel comfortable. These mentors can help shed stigma because they relate with their clients and can help people understand mental illness does not have to be feared. As the PWMI in the video indicated, the PWMI felt good to have someone to talk to and discuss their mental health issues with someone who not only understood what they are going through, but also had their mental health illness in common, which allowed them to feel comfortable and forget about the stigma involving their condition. This type of mentorship can help people understand PWMI and begin to shed the stigma of mental illness because the mentors (who also suffered from mental illness), can set the example that they have the ability to work through their illness and ultimately become productive citizens of society. They can demonstrate that PWMI can overcome the stigma that follows mental illness and be successful in life as they are demonstrating through this program of mentoring. These PWMI are serving as a purpose and as a savior for others who suffer from PWMI who may not be as strong as them. This can help further shed the stigma of mental illness by providing proof that PWMI can be normal and not violent. Having these mentors share their own success stories followed by helping others who are suffering through the same things they did due to their mental health issues, provides society an example that PWMI can be stabilized or rehabilitated, which can result in shedding stigma in addition to these individuals making a difference with the PWMI community. Therefore, through this mentorship program, PWMI can share their rehabilitation stories and demonstrate through their own experiences that people who suffer from mental illness can serve as advocates for society and help break the stigma of mental illness. Stigma does not need to define these people and they can have hope of becoming role models as those presented in the video. This type of mentoring is a great step towards shedding stigma."
1864,"The full implementation of the recommendations indicated in the position paper by the American College of Physicians would affect the involvement, identification, treatment, and outcomes of the mentally ill and the criminal justice system in a positive way. First, if the recommendation to integrate behavioral health care into primary care would go through, then PWMI would have the ability to address and have the ability to treat their mental health issues a lot easier. PWMI would have the opportunity to seek treatment for the mental health issues in the same way they do when they obtain treatment for any other illness when they go to their regular doctor for a medical issue. The process would in the same form of simply presenting medical insurance cards and would not require the PWMI to have to complete paperwork or go through an additional or separate administrative process to obtain mental health care. This would not only make it more convenient and easier, but it would be more discrete and avoid unnecessary “embarrassment” for the PWMI who would have to fill out paperwork, outlining their mental health issues each time they chose to obtain treatment. Because PWMI would have the ability to obtain their treatment a lot more easily and not have to go through the additional steps to request treatment, could lead to PWMI obtaining mental health treatment on more regular basis. PWMI may go to the doctor and seek treatment for their issues on a more consistent basis. Therefore, if PWMI ultimately entered the criminal justice system (by being arrested and end up in jails/prisons or placed on supervision such as probation/parole), most likely they would not need as many mental health resources or attention because they were already obtaining mental health treatment with their primary doctors on a regular basis. This could impact the criminal justice system in a positive way because it would cut back on the amount of funding it takes to provide constant and extended forms of mental health treatment for inmates while they are incarcerated. Second, as indicated in the article, if mental health programs are maintained, it could lead to the minimizing of stigma. PWMI would be more willing to seek mental health treatment if there were numerous programs involving mental health care and it was viewed as common care just like any other medical issue. If mental health treatment was integrated with primary care, it would be easier and less odd for PWMI t"
1865,"Hi Nani, You and I shared the same thoughts that full implementation of the recommendations discussed in the American College of Physicians Position Paper would positively affect the involvement, identification, and outcomes of the mentally ill in the CJ system. I also recognized that integrating behavioral health into primary care would make obtaining treatment for PWMI a lot easier and discrete. PWMI would have the ability to obtain treatment as easy as going to the doctor for a cold or the flu. This could positively influence PWMI to go the doctor when they feel they needed therapy, treatment and medication and a lot more often. Also, as indicated by Crowley et al. (2015), integrating these two health cares could help shed Stigma and help PWMI not be as hesitant to obtain treatment. You made some great points that PWMI simply do not obtain treatment and made a solid argument by providing the statistical information that supports PWMI turn to their primary care physician (32%) over seeking mental health treatment (4%). I also recognized the significance in the statistics provided in the article and indicated in my post that 8.2% of PWMI did not seek treatment because they preferred no one knew about it, 9.5% did not want their friends or neighbors to know because they felt they would be seen in a negative manner, and 9.6% did not seek treatment because they knew they would not be anonymous. To me this evidence supports if stigma pertaining to mental health illness did not exist, more PWMI would seek treatment and perhaps this country would not be going through this mental health crisis. I also shared your thoughts about the more PWMI were treated for their mental illness, the less engagement they had with law enforcement and the criminal justice system because they were stabilized more often and perhaps even led to recovery. I also felt the criminal justice system would benefit financially because if PWMI were receiving treatment regularly which could lead to the stability and recovery, even if they were arrested and they entered the jail/prison system, the need for mental health treatment, medication or additional resources would not be so demanding on the state. If these integrations would occur, PWMI would be obtaining treatment a lot easier and more often, which could result in minimizing expenses to the criminal justice system (i.e. jails/prisons). Inmates would be getting treatment outside of the legal system regularly an"
1866,"Hi Viviana, Your thoughts regarding the recommendation by the American College of Physicians to integrate mental health care and primary care were similar to mine. I also recognized the importance of making sure these two systems worked together because of the information I read in the article. As you indicated, Munetz and Teller (2003) supports all of the main points you indicated in your post. Those points are only going to improve things for both the mental health system and criminal justice system. For example, as we both discussed in our post, the positive impact integrating these systems would make on stigma. I also believed that if these two systems were integrated, it would shed stigma and PWMI would seek treatment a lot more often, not only because it would be easier to obtain, but because it could be viewed as obtaining any other medical treatment. You made a great point that by integrating these systems, there would also be a solution to the staffing issues that mental hospitals and jails/prisons are known to have. As indicated in last week module and the article by DHS, mental health hospitals are short staffed and sometimes utilizes staff such as cooks and maintenance workers to help out with patients. Integrating these systems would allow medical staff and the criminal justice system to work that much closer and perhaps share responsibilities to fill in when they are understaffed. They can also consistently network about the mental health services being offered to PWMI both in and out of jail. I also indicated that integrating these systems would simply lead to PWMI regularly obtaining the mental health treatment they need outside of the legal system so that if and when they did end up incarcerated, they would not be so reliant on the jail system to provide them with treatment. PWMI would become more self-reliant on obtaining their own treatment outside of jail because it would be easier to obtain and there would not be so much stigma attached to it. Furthermore, because they would not have to go through extra procedures to apply for mental health services (since it would go hand and hand with their primary care) it would be less embarrassing to seek because it would simply be like going the doctor for a normal visit. They would not have to complete application paperwork that exposed their mental health status to medical staff members each time."
1867,"If the prison system was adequately staffed with the proper mental health workers, Timothy would have been evaluated and transferred into a psychiatric hospital where he would receive the care he needed.  "
1868,"In terms of gun violence I believe that anyone with a bad intention whether mentally ill or otherwise should be kept away from guns. I do agree that placing a gun in the hands of a person experiencing hallucinations or delusion could lead to dangerous consequences. This does not mean they will only harm others but could possibly harm themselves. Therefore, I am not going to say a mentally ill person will never become violent - this is unpredictable. However, the issue of gun violence has nothing to do with the mentally ill. A national registry may be helpful but I do not believe it will curb the issues related to mass shootings in America. It is not the mentally ill that is the issue it is the accessibility of guns in general that is the major risk factor. Hence I believe that cost of operating the national registry outweighs the benefits."
1869,"I believe the most important problem to fix is community care. Instead of releasing a person with mental illness from an institution without proper care such as treatment and housing, only those with property housing and the ability to access outpatient treatment facilities should be released. I believe this issue is the leading cause of the mentally ill coming into contact with the criminal justice system."
1870,"Reflect on the various ways in which mental illness has been viewed throughout the centuries. What do you think the different views may suggest about self-determination of persons with mental illness and our willingness to consider them full-fledged members of society? Mental illness has being stigmatized throughout history. It is this stigmatization that has caused many issues that lead to the ill-treatment, neglect, torture and alienation of the mentally ill. Despite  the fact that mental illness diagnosis is categorize: some as severe while others are categorized as non severe, persons with non severe mental illness  who are able to function effectively in society with treatment will still be stigmatized and stereotyped . Society will  view the mentally ill  even if functional and non violent through a broken lens of judgement rather than through the lens of a human being with differences. History have shown that people with mental illness whether severe or otherwise have been ostracized and ridiculed by society. An issue that has made mental illness somewhat of a taboo. Whether a mentally ill person has the ability to function effectively within society with the aid of outpatient care is not the sole concern of some members of society. Society, even today still clings to historical perception that a society in which the mentally exist is unsafe even if that mentally ill person is non violent.  As a result, once a person is diagnosed as mentally ill, I don't believe that society will view them as full fledged members. Instead, there will always be this social stain attributed to the fact that an individual is mentally ill. If a mentally ill person makes a humanly mistake, this will not be judged on the imperfection of their human quality but rather their mistakes will always be attributed to their mental illness which is perceived and viewed as a defect.  In a society that once believe mental illness stemmed from immorality or from a person being possessed by an evil spirit, we still have not travelled too far from those primitive perceptions of the mentally ill. Today the perception is that the mentally ill is predisposed to violence, as a result, they should not be given the same fundamental rights as the other members of society. Until  society possesses the ability to erase the primitive perceptions of mental illness, the mentally ill, functional or otherwise will never be treated or considered full fledged members of society."
1871,"Hi Nani, great post! I too believe that we have evolved from some of the prior myths and misconceptions as it relates to the perception of the mentally ill, however, like you I too believe that many members of society are still unable to view the mentally ill as full fledged members of society. This is quite sad because there are individuals with non severe mental illnesses such as anxiety disorders who are capable of functioning effectively in society but are still stigmatized and treated differently because they have been diagnosed with a mental illness."
1872,"Hi Asia, great post! Historically the perceptions of mental illness have been nothing short of bizarre as society did not view mental illness from a medical perspective but rather through the lens of superstition. These views lead to the mentally ill being perceived from a world-view where they are incapable of taking care of themselves as society perceived the mentally ill as being unable to control their actions or thoughts. Although, we have evolved I still believe that those prior negative connotations still lingers on in society's perception of the mentally ill and fuels the thought that the mentally ill are pre-disposed to violence a perception that prevents society from viewing the mentally ill as full fledged members of society."
1873,Great post Denise! I too believe that it is a lack of awareness as well as  a lack of funding to support the mentally ill that has fueled the negative connotations that society has employed towards the mentally ill and mental illnesses.
1874,"Great post Cornise! I agree with you wholeheartedly, inclusion is definitely key to the acceptance of PWMI as full fledge members of society. I believe that the diagnosis of mental illness renders individuals as the ""other"" members of society, rather than members of society. An ideology that exclude PWMI from certain fundamental rights, especially the rights to be treated as the average  human being."
1875,"Hi Stephanie, thank you! Precisely different era and an evolution in the way PWMI are excluded from society. I totally agree with your points!  "
1876,"Given the various forms of stigma related to PWMI, what should teachings/curricula contain to combat stigma? Consider elementary, middle and high schools as potential target groups. Since the myths and misconception regarding mental illness is rooted in history, it will be quite difficult to change society's perception of PWMI, however, it could be achieved overtime. I would say the biggest stigma of all is the idea that PWMI are incompetent . Whenever I encounter individuals who express this perception of PWMI, I want to direct them to the movie ""A Beautiful Mind."" The movie is an autobiography of John Nash, a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize Memorial winner whose economic theories are used even today. John also struggled with paranoid schizophrenia. John's struggles with mental illness and his epic recovery and return to academic work after fighting and controlling his disease was so magnificent, it became a movie. John's story, is the greatest rebuttal to the misconception that PWMI are incompetent. In addition, it shows that mental illness does not mean the brain is not functional, it simple means that sometimes like any other  body part it may become unwell. Likewise, it also depicts that just like one's hypertension or diabetes can be treated, an individual's mental illness can also be treated and controlled.   The fact is, PWMI possess some of the most beautiful minds this world has ever seen. Their intelligence and brilliance almost unquantifiable. I believe adding the movie,  A Beautiful Mind to elementary, middle and high school curriculum would be a great teaching aid to assist in the education of the next generation and combatting the stigmatization of PWMI. Likewise, showing examples of John Nash's work and his many achievements would be a great supplemental resources as well.   Providing images of notable and equally successful individuals with mental illness who despite their diagnosis have managed to lead normal lives  just as anyone else would be instrumental to the curriculum as well. Individuals such as Mel Gibson and Mariah Carey who have both revealed they have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder  but have managed to establish successful careers in the performing arts could be notable references. Diminishing the idea that PWMI are incompetent is the first stigma that society needs to eliminate. I believe if focus is placed on all the positives that PWMI are capable of achieving this wi"
1877,"Great post Denise! I like the age group specific break down. Starting with Stories for Elementary school children and then taking a more serious approach with the older children. Great approach! Maybe bringing in a PWMI who has been successfully navigating society, have a job, went to college, have their own apt etc as a guest speaker would also compliment this teaching model- especially for the older children."
1878,"Great post Steve! I believe the focus on the difference in development is truly a great path to inclusivity that can foster the understanding that PWMI are the same as anyone else In many ways. Therefore, it is useful for children to understand that in the same manner that  we develop differently in a physically sense (different height and physical features), we also develop different mentally. As a result, there is no need to label individuals who are mentally ill. Instead, we should employ the same perception we have when a person is physically ill with diseases such as cancer and diabetes. It is just another condition that can be treated and managed. Again great post!"
1879,"I agree Viviana, the media has lost its objectivity and promotes sensationalism so they can increase ratings. The role of the media as the watchdog of society or the gatekeepers of information is no more. The negative attributes they attach to PWMI is not only contributing to society’s stigmatization of the mentally ill but self stigmatization as well."
1880,Great point Alyse! Bringing to light the idea that mental illness does not separate an individual from success is a very powerful message that society needs to reinforce.
1881,Humanism provided a new way of thinking that changed society's perception of the mentally ill. Prior to this PWMI were treated very poorly as their illness was attributed to evil spirits and other mythical and superstitious reasons.
1882,"The presidential office is an influential one. The president can change the current narrative regarding how society views PWMI by using their platform to eliminate certain misconceptions that society holds where the mentally ill is concerned. Like president Obama stated in his speech, the brain is just another body part, hence mental illness is just as treatable as a broken arm. "
1883,"The reduction of benefits for mental heath care shows that policymakers are not looking at mental illness as treatable. Every other illness such as diabetes, hypertension, cancer just to name a few are viewed differently. It seems the message that the policymakers are sending is that hope exists for people with other health conditions but for PWMI there is no hope so why bother provide funding for mental health care. I find this situation to be really problematic because it classifies PWMI as the ""others"" and that should not be the case."
1884,"It seems that some psychotic drugs can complicate the symptoms of PTSD. As a result, the medication may cause more harm than good. Since hallucinations is described as one of the possible side effects of psychotic drugs, I don't believe that it should be a form of treatment  for either active military or veterans who are trained soldiers. I believe alternative forms of therapy such as medication and exercise therapy could prove to be more useful forms of treatment. I believe the practice of yoga  for example could be a useful form of alternate therapy that promotes relaxation and meditation. I think prior to placing individuals on psychotic drugs efforts should be made to explore other forms of alternate treatment and assessment made to evaluate the effectiveness of these alternate treatments in soothing or controlling the symptoms of soldiers with mental illness."
1885,"I believe that if an individual shows symptoms of mental illness and are at risk in terms of homelessness or substance abuse then I believe their family members should be able to intervene and get them the treatment they need. Society should only be allowed to intervene if a person with mental illness is living on the street or may be isolated from family members and this is only if this individual shows signs of declining health. I have this belief because I believe that in the same manner that a cancer patient can choose to refuse treatment, due to the side effects of drug therapy such as chemo therapy drugs, PWMI have a right to refuse treatment if the side effects of the drug outweighs its benefits and society should not have the right to force PWMI to accept treatment in such a case."
1886,"Reflect on the pros and cons of inpatient and outpatient involuntary commitment, what do you think are the appropriate measures of success for these forms of treatment for the individual as well as society?  Why? Mandated stay whether inpatient or outpatients takes away an individual's right to choose. While it is said that mandated outpatient care has its benefits such as: it has resulted in continued treatment after the commitment period has ended, decreases homelessness among the mentally ill, decreases victimization of the mentally ill, it also decreases the level of autonomy PWMI have over their lives. Likewise, mandated inpatient treatment is said to be beneficial because it provides care to those who need it, assist families of PWMI  with care of their loved ones as inpatient facilities are fully responsible for care of  individual throughout the commitment period.  Finally, the patient is said to be protected from self harm as well as prevented from harming others while committed, but again this individual loses their liberty. It could be said that an additional pro of outpatient care would be the ability for PWMI to continue their normal lives while receiving needed care. Likewise, the major pro for inpatient care in my opinion would be the provision of  needed care for individuals with severe mental disorders who would have been otherwise at risk for other self destructive habits such as substance abuse.  Again the con for both forms of mandated treatment is lost of liberty for PWMI. Mandated commitment seems to tie in with the stigma that PWMI need others to make decisions for them as they don't possess enough logic or rationality to think for themselves - there are many irrational individuals in society who have not been diagnosed with mental illness. As it relates to an appropriate measure of success for these forms of treatment, I would say the ability to have a major percentage (possible 75%) of individuals who receive mandated treatment successfully re-enter society and given the opportunity to lead their lives with minor or few relapses would be a huge indicator of the success of these  treatment forms. Additionally, having society accept these individuals without associating any form of stigma to formerly committed PMWI would also be a great measure of success.  However, this may be hard since oftentimes, patients who are committed involuntarily are described as having a grave disability, which is indicative of"
1887,"Great post Viviana! I too believe that while both forms of treatment are advantageous, they feed into the stigma that PWMI are incapable of making their own decisions. Especially in those states that utilizes grave disability to support involuntary commitment. I believe that society needs to change the narrative geared towards PWMI. Mental illness is just another condition like cancer, or diabetes from which individuals can recover once they receive proper treatment."
1888,"Great post Briana! I especially liked how you highlight the disparities where Blacks are concerned in regards to involuntary commitment. History has proven that Blacks have always been marginalized and robbed of their rights. I guess this makes it even a little more of an infringement on the black community as we have historically have our liberty stolen from us. However, in that same breath no individual regardless of race, class or creed should  be marginalized. Yet in some cases that is how mandated treatment may cause PWMI to feel - marginalized. Although there are some benefits to involuntary commitment, there are certainly cons, especially where liberty is concerned. "
1889,"A false positive would definitely infringe on the rights of individuals. As these individuals would have predicted to display future behavior that would affect their safety or the safety of others in society, as such they would be committed to receive mandated inpatient or outpatient treatment. Meanwhile, the false negatives would actually be those who would actually exhibit future violent behavior but are not receiving the required care they need because of a lack of sensitivity in the screening used to detect behavioral issues."
1890,"This is a very controversial topic.  A sex offender could be a 18 year old boy who sends a picture of his chest to his 16 year old girlfriend. In this case this is a bad idea. As the severity of the crime is pretty low. I believe this is an issue that should be reviewed on a case by case basis. In the case of Matthew Koso, yes this should have been the case as he showed no remorse for what he did. Instead, he continued his behavior and tried to use marriage as a shield. He should have been civil committed as he shows  clear signs that he would re-offended  - he married his victim."
1891,I consider both forms of treatment to be equally forceful. They both are indicating that PWMI are incapable of making life decisions for themselves. The fact that one form of mandated treatment allows an individual to remain in the community doesn't making any less intrusive than the other. Both are gross infringement on the liberty of PWMI.
1892,"The Taheri study did not find sufficient evidence showing the effectiveness of CIT models, however it did show that CIT trained officers were more likely to transport PWMI to community based programs than their non-trained CIT counterparts (Taheri, S. A, 2016). While the study did not produce conclusive results it does show that at least CIT officers were more prepared to identify the need of PWMI. Instead of arresting PWMI and transporting them to prison, CIT trained officers were able to make an educated decision regarding the most suitable placement for these individuals. I do believe that this shows some promise as it related to how PWMI are treated as well as the services they will receive from law enforcement officers. Since, deinstitutionalization a lot of PMWI have been placed in the wider society. Like, everyone else they have to interact with law enforcement officers and like any other marginalized group, they don't always get the correct results. Studies have shown that PWMI, especially those that are homeless are more likely to spend longer times in jail than any other suspect. They are also more likely to be charged with a felony. I am disappointed that the Taheri's study did show some evidence that the CIT model have no outcome on effects of arrest or officer's use of force. This is my only draw back regarding fully endorsing the continued use of the model.  As a result, my thoughts would be if officers continue to receive CIT  training within precincts  they will be able  to identify the needs of PWMI and transport them to proper facilities and not jail.  This is why  I would suggest, going back to the drawing board and improve on the program. Like the study,  I too have concerns  regarding its wide spread implementation without improvements. H owever, it is better to have some safeguards in place to protect PWMI rather than none at all . Hence my overall suggestion,  revamp the program and run a test pilot in selected precincts, conduct evaluations and assessments to identify weak points of the program. A point of evaluation could be the ratio of non-CIT trained offices vs trained CIT officers, this could indicate whether or not there are enough CIT trained officers to meet the needs of the population. If there are too little CIT trained officers this could affect the overall effectiveness of the program. I"
1893,Great post Alyse! I too felt the positive attributes of the program such as the finding that officers who received CIT training who had encounters with PWMI were likely to take these persons to community based programs rather than jail to be a step in the right direction. Like you I felt the program may have some hope if it was improved upon.
1894,"Great post Steve! I too think the training the officers receive through  the CIT model is important and assists in better serving members in the community who are mentally ill. Especially, in an era where deinstitutionalization has placed a lot of person’s with severe mental illness in out patient care. I agree with you improving the program would have way more benefits than eliminating it."
1895, Great idea Jennifer! Looking at the study from a voluntary  vs involuntary participation perspective could yield very different results. It would be very interesting  to see what those results would look like and also see how they impact or predict the effectiveness of the program.
1896," Great observation Alyse! It is these little elements or small victories that makes the program valuable. So while the study was inconclusive regarding its overall effectiveness, instances like the one you pulled from the article prove that it should not be eliminated."
1897,Thanks Liisa! The documentation component would certainly assist in assessing the program’s effectiveness.
1898,"I believe the first stage - entry into the system will be the hardest for PWMI. I believe in many cases PWMI may not fully understand the miranda if they are having an episode or not in a lucid state. Therefore, the right to remain silence or the psychological stress of the interrogation process will be hard on PWMI. "
1899,"The challenges that may arise for PWMI  with the recent changes in California  corrections shifting responsibility to local jurisdiction may result in overcrowding in local county jails which may lead to poor treatment of PWMI within the prison population. The benefits of the shift may be a reduction in arrest for less serious crimes, in addition, this may prompt county officials to transfer PWMI to community based programs instead of to jail."
1900,It is not fair that police officers serve as first responders because they do not the specialized training necessary to handle mental health crisis or have a formalized policy to handle PWMI.  
1901,"The relationship between CIT and stigma is, CIT has potentially lowered the stigmatizing attitude that police officers have towards PWMI."
1902,"Realignment posed several challenges to California's jails. Prior to the passage of Prop 47 which took effect in October of 2014, population in County jails increased by 14%. This created overcrowding issues as the average daily population was above the typical specified amount. However, since realignment had prisons offsetting  their  responsibilities to local and county jails, these facilities were overburdened due to conversion into extended stay facilities rather than their  intended purpose as temporary holding facilities. As a result, the daily population increased. The maximum sentence served increased from one year to over 5 years. The use of jail for PWMI is never appropriate. This means that the use of jails for people who are seriously ill is extremely inappropriate. People with serious mental illness needs proper care. The issues created by realignment such as the shortage of beds and medication reduces the capacity of jail officials to properly care for PWMI especially those who have been diagnosed with a serious mental illness. In addition, the increased violence brought about by overcrowding further complicates the jail experience for people with serious mental illness. Person's with serious mental illness may be at risk for abuse, relapse or even falling in a manic or depressive state due to environmental conditions brought about by overcrowding and hostility.  I believe the jail experience for people with serious mental illness is an unfavorable one overall. However, when the issues brought about by realignment are added to this scenario it further complicates the situation.  People with serious mental illness are not only being denied proper care when they are placed in jail, under realignment people with serious mental illness are being exposed to violence and other adverse effects that may result from overcrowded jail cells.  In addition, jails don't typically possess proper medical facilities or well trained medical personnel who are equipped to care for people with mental illness. Hence, jail officials may not be able to properly care for a person with serious mental illness who is in distress or in crisis. In addition, given the issue of overcrowding if a person with mental illness needs to be separated from the general population for their own safety this may not be possible.  There are so many negative situations that can arise from using jails to house the seriously mentally ill. In addition to the scena"
1903,"Hi Briana great post! I too believe that realignment catastrophized the situation created by de-institutionalization.  Under realignment persons with serious mental illness are on the verge of relapse, victimization and even suicide due to a lack of adequate medication and proper care. To further complicate the issue, PWMI can now be held in  jail for an extended period of time as well as become exposed to the violent conditions of an overcrowded jail cell."
1904,"Great post Clara. However, I beg to differ where it concerns PWMI being held culpable for  crimes. I think that if a PWMI committed a crime while in a manic state or while hallucinating that voids culpability, hence the insanity plea. I believe even PWMI who commit a crime need to be housed in a mental healthcare facility that can properly care for their needs. If a person is of unsound mind I believe the law makes provisions by way of the insanity plea that relieve them of culpability, once it can be proven that said individual was not lucid during the commission of the crime."
1905,"It is extremely unfortunate that jails have become the premiere mental institution for the mentally ill.  It is very tragic that the severely mentally ill will come in contact with the criminal justice system because there is no alternative. It must be frustrating for law enforcement officials as well. For the mentally ill, contact with the justice system places PWMI at a grave disadvantage because they are coming in contact with a criminal system when they should be in contact with mental health care facilities and treatment."
1906,"I believe the three indicators that jails should measure about people with mental illness are: 1. homelessness 2. Type of offense that are landing these individuals in jail. Are they being accused of survival crimes such as trespassing ( finding somewhere to sleep) or retail theft finding food to eat. 3. Medical history - Does this person have a history of mental illness? If these indicators are measured then law enforcement officers will be able to transport PWMI to community base programs rather than jails. In addition, there may be proper documentation re: statistics of the number of PWMI that access the jail system on a day to dat basis."
1907,"This is a tough question. Jail inmates do have rights, right to a fair trail, right to remain silent  (Fifth Amendment right) and the right to get treatment if they are ill. I believe they do have the basic rights when all things are considered. It is hard to advocate for more rights when essence outside of PWMI who may commit a crime unknowingly, other inmates gave up many of their rights when they decide to participate in criminal activities."
1908,"I believe medication is favored over other forms of treatment such as therapy because it is easier to administer. Jails are grossly understaffed and as such do not have trained psychiatric staff that would be needed to provide alternative types of therapy.  In addition due to overcrowding tele-psychiatry treatment may not be a good option as well . Hence, medication becomes the easier option."
1909,"The risk-need-responsivity  (RNR) is a correctional assessment and treatment model geared towards public safety. Despite its public safety goals, there are no arguments from those endorsing the model to limit or stop interventions geared at public health goals (reducing symptoms and improving functioning). However, RNR's popularity has led to the reduction of the emphasis placed on evidence-based mental practices for PWMI. A point that  needs to be considered where RNR is  concerned is as follows: while  the model is widespread and a strongly advocated;  Skeem et al. (2015) cautioned that the belief that the model will improve programs' ability to achieve both public safety and health goals lacks empirical support.   Given the aforementioned information, I would advise a Chief Probation Officer to integrate interventions with strong empirical support with the RNR model. The mentally ill are vulnerable and while public safety is important, the justice system has an equal responsibility to serve and protect the mentally ill population. As a result, improving the functionality and overall health of the mentally ill should be a part of any model used to monitor or manage that population. Skeem et al. (2015), stated in their article that cognitive behavioral therapy programs (CBT) is an evidence based program that targets risk factors related to recidivism. CBT programs are said to also provide opportunities for PWMI to practice prosocial skills that promotes better interpersonal interactions, self management and problem solving skills.  I would advise the Chief probation officer, that merging programs such as CBT programs with the RNR model may have a more positive outcome. The RNR does not have any empirical evidence to support its effectiveness where achieving either public health goals or safety are concerned. In addition, if public health goals are not met, public safety goals are not met. PWMI are a part of the public and their safety is dependent on the state of their health. It is for this reason, that we need programs that are proven to achieve both goals. If public health goals are met for the mentally ill, then public safety goals are also met. I am not saying that PWMI are responsible for majority of the crimes committed, but rather, I am saying that if people with mental illness are functioning and in good health, they are safer within their respective communities. They will be able to care for themselves more effectively and may"
1910,Great post Viviana! I too believe that merging RNR with evidence based models that seeks to improve  the functionality of PWMI would be more effective than utilizing the RNR model by itself. I believe reducing symptoms and improving functionality would be a more effective approach to achieving public health and safety goals than using control to diminish risk.
1911,"Hi Briana, great post! However, I see PWMI as members of society who like everyone else needs protection. You included at the beginning of your post some of the crimes that are frequently committed against the mentally ill - more likely to be physically and sexually abused. As a result, if the Chief Probation Officer focuses on a risk based model that has no empirical evidence supporting its effectiveness where public health and public safety goals are concerned, in my opinion this model should not be the sole model utilized to manage the mentally ill population on probation. However, I believe that using the RNR model in conjunction with evidence based models or model would yield more successful outcomes.  "
1912,"I do not believe that it is fair to use risk assessment tools when they are not 100% accurate. Reason being, there can be false positives and false negatives which may negatively impact public safety and public health outcomes."
1913,"I think mental health professionals would be more receptive of a model that has empirical evidence showing its health outcomes. I don't believe that they would be receptive of the RNR model as it is more focused on recidivism rate among PWMI who come into contact with the justice system, rather than improved health and functionality.  I believe the main concern that mental health professionals would be concerned with is improved health and function as well as how that impacts positively on the recidivism rate."
1914,"I believe the focus on recidivism takes away from the emphasis needed when addressing the needs of PWMI such as treatment. Probation as explained in the video focuses more on public safety rather than public health and such a set up is not appropriate to address PWMI. In my opinion, probation as described in the video is similar to jail - it lacks the essential resources needed to address the needs of PWMI."
1915,"I believe that I prefer mental health court.  I believe that PWMI should be given treatment rather than punishment.  I prefer mental health over the traditional court  system is more of a wellness hearing/support rather than a punitive, arbitrary system. There may be some disadvantages such as the case with the lady who wanted to live with her sister but instead was detained to be placed in a treatment facility. Aside from that I like the model because in my opinion providing treatment for the mentally ill is more supportive and productive than taking punitive sanctions."
1916,"Thanks Cornise! I believe the probation officers for the mentally ill should have psychology or sociology based training, this way they can act more in the capacity of case managers. A case manger type of approach would possibly emphasize a more treatment base approach on their part. Given information provided in this weeks lecture and readings, I believe probation is modeled based on the rehabilitative nature of our punitive justice system. It would be surprising if probation officers  indeed have knowledge of CBT - but they should if they are supposed to help PWMI transition into the community successfully.  "
1917,Thanks Nani! Yes I agree integrating a treatment based model that has data proving its effectiveness will significantly assist law enforcement/probation  officers to meet their public safety goals. It will also assist in meeting public health goals as well.
1918,"Thanks Bobbie! Yes if the main concern of probation officers is risk/lower recidivism rate then, they should consider programs such as the CBT program. It seems that people stigmatize PWMI and think they are responsible for all the violence that occur within society, they also don't seem to consider the needs of the mentally ill in the discussion of public safety. "
1919,"Regarding your point: ""If the probation officer used this model they could find what motivates that mentally ill person in order to keep them committed to their treatment and staying out of the justice system."" Exactly! Thanks Nicolle."
1920,"Jennifer, I advocated for the merger of CBT and RNR because of the life skills the program promoted. If PWMI are taught social and problem solving skills etc. it will assist them to better navigate society."
1921,"I think prisons can best meet the needs of the mentally ill if they combine risk assessment with a treatment focus approach.  Adams & Ferrandino (2008),  emphasized the fact that there is no one-stop shop in terms of a particular classification available to identify risk levels. Hence the input from prison administrators via risk assessment as well as evaluations from clinicians are vital in predicting the course of treatment need as well as  risk (Adams & Ferrandino, 2008). I believe managing the functionality of PWM, enhancing their social skills as well as evaluating their risk to re-offend can assist in meeting the needs of PWMI in prison.  If a person with mental illness shows a very low chance of recidivism in general, then when they receive treatment and are able to function effectively both socially and emotionally, their rate of recidivism may even decline further. If prison officials and clinicians are able to effectively reintroduce low risk persons with mental illness into society as functional members, who can take care of themselves financially and otherwise then this would minimize the number of PWMI who come into contact with the criminal justice system. If these individuals are empowered to return to their respective communities as financially independent individuals who may have limited to no contact with the criminal justice system, then this may reduce operational costs regarding provision of services for a large population of mentally ill individuals in prison. Therefore, I believe in the interim more provisions need to be made for the mentally ill. There is a need for additional clinicians and staff trained to effectively manage and treat PWMI throughout the prison system. In addition providing specialized programs to provide alternative forms of treatment such as CBT and other therapeutic programs may cost a lot initially but will eventually become cost efficient.  These programs may eventually reduce the number of PWMI who re-enter the prison system and as a result overtime , reduce the cost associated with the provision of in-prison mental health programs and services as the need for such services may reduce significantly.   The reason why prison administrators need to invest more resources into the management of the mentally ill population is as follows: PWMI are more likely to serve longer prison sentences, they are more likely to re-enter the penal system because of homeless, substance abuse et"
1922,"Great post Viviana! I like the idea of assigning contact officers to each inmate. However, one thing that needs to be considered is the prison population here in the US vs the prison population in Norway.  According to a Bureau of statistic report published by CNN, in 2016 nearly 2.2 million adults were held in prisons and jails in America. The ratio that coincided with this number is, approximately 655 out of every 100,000 resident of the US was held in prison or jail vs Norways ratio of 75 out of 100,000 as reported in the Huffington post. It is said that Norwegians pay no attention to their prison cost, which is as a result of its humane structure and programs that enables them to have one of the lowest recidivism rate. Therefore, I do understand why you suggested modeling our prison system here in the US after Norway's system. However, before we can mimic Norway, we first need to focus on an effective way to reduce our prison intake in a bid to reduce the current prison population.  Since the mentally ill are most likely to be arrested, serve longer prisons sentences and more likely to reoffend, I believe its feasible to target this population. Implement programs to get PWMI on track with lower recidivism rates and as a result reduce their contact with the justice system and maybe eventually lower our national incarceration rate/prison population.  https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/28/us/mass-incarceration-five-key-facts/index.html https://www.huffpost.com/entry/not-the-worst-but-not-norway-us-prisons-vs-other_b_59b0772ae4b0c50640cd646d"
1923,Great post Liisa! Your idea of  pre-trial diversion programs to channel PWMI outside of the prison system and into specialized programs that could best cater to their needs. I do believe that the cost associated with financially supporting prisons /jails as well as programs for PWMI within the prison and jail system is the overwhelming population within those institutions. The overburdening prison/jail population is also one of the main issues that places both prisoners and the prison/jail workforce at risk. Population reduction is definitely a start to regulate both cost and safety in prisons/jails.
1924,"Hi Karen! Yes,  utilizing risk assessment and treatment hand in hand would be more effective than utilizing risk assessment on its own. In addition, due to the overwhelming population in our nation's prisons today, the cost to revamp the system will be high. However, overtime in will become extremely cost efficient. I believe one of the major issues crippling the prison system comes from deinstitutionalization. deinstitutionalization left PWMI without proper resources in terms of care and unfortunately that population ended up in the prison and jail systems. Therefore, placing focus on that population and getting them into the areas that they need - programs that get them back on track. Since prisons/jails houses a large majority of mentally ill  population  we can start by instituting the programs there."
1925,"Hi Briana, Since I pushed the need to merge the risk assessment model with CBT, this would facilitate the need for clinicians (mental health professions who utilizes CBT) and corrections officers (inclusive of probation officers who use the RNR model) working together. However, instead of the focus being on risk and public safety it would be on functionality and reintegration into society as independent individuals with a low risk of recidivism (emphasis on both public safety and public health).   This means that PWMI will have access to resources other  than medication, they would have access to therapeutic programs that may best cater to the development of social and cognitive functions and hence successful reintegration into society. "
1926,Thanks Ka man!
1927,PWMI may go into crisis while in solitary confinement. Solitary confinement may aggravate certain mental health symptoms such as hallucinations and suicidal thoughts. 
1928,"I believe that rehabilitation from a penal perspective is punitive. Rehabilitation involves punishment  (imprisonment) or a certain type of treatments (solitary confinement, lack of liberty) to make the idea of prison undesirable. PWMI needs treatment. Hence, my answer is no. Prison will heighten the symptoms rather than relieve them."
1929,"I do not believe that there are any advantages of putting inmates in solitary confinement. Solitary confinement exposes inmates to excess stress, which could exacerbate pre-existing issues such as mental illness. Additionally,  solitary confinement may lead to anxiety issues for those without prior history of mental illness. However, what solitary does for prison officials is give them one less inmate in general population to worry about. "
1930,I believe tax dollars should be used to fund community based programs to avoid PWMI ending up in prison in the first place.
1931,I would understand the need for the Fulton State Hospital and also the benefits it would have for PWMI. I would not oppose the construction. I think I would rather have my tax dollars go towards a medical facility that will provide proper care for PWMI rather than fund prison treatment programs for PWMI.
1932,"I would not describe the ""Not guilty by Reason of Insanity"" as a get out jail free card. There are a lot of PWMI who qualify for this plea. If a mentally ill person was having an episode during a commission of a crime in which they are involved, then diminish capacity should means no culpability. "
1933,State hospitals can best deal with patient and staff safety by adequately training staff to handle situations with PWMI. Have enough security personnel who are trained to handle situations in which PWMI are in crisis. Ensure that the facility is adequately staffed to meet operation needs.
1934,"If deep brain stimulation is allowing patients to lead better quality of life and preventing destructive behavior such as suicide I think it is a viable form of treatment. However, given the side effects, I believe doctors should be extremely transparent so patients are able to make the decisions they believe is best for them. This extreme form of treatment and any extreme form of treatment for that matter is a personal choice."
1935,"State hospitals are said to be a financial burden on states in which they operated as they are unable to collect funds from Medicaid based on a federal regulation (Fisher et al, 2009).  As a result, state hospitals are primarily funded by tax payer's dollars. In comparison, general hospitals are usually inclusive of a psychiatric ward, these hospitals can collect money from state insurances such as Medicaid (Fisher et al, 2009). Therefore, it would be easy for one to assume that it would be more cost efficient to utilize state hospitals for forensic patients only.  Since forensic patients are ordered by the courts to remain in psychiatric care because they are deemed incompetent to stand trial. However, general hospitals may not be able to meet the demands of non-forensic psychiatric patients who are in need of long term care. These patients are better served by state psychiatric hospitals. If state hospitals are  used to house forensic patients only, wouldn't this mean that state hospitals would be in essence psychiatric prisons? In addition, what would happen to psychiatric patients who are in need of care but they do not have insurance? Are we then indicating that they should commit a crime in order to receive treatment? Wouldn't we be creating the need to breach public safety in an attempt to access psychiatric care? I do not believe that state hospitals should only house forensic patients. However, I do believe forensic patients should be house in state hospitals rather than prisons. If a person is unable to stand trial because they are incompetent to stand trial, then they need to be housed where they have access to care. Likewise, if a person is deemed not guilty based on Insanity then that individual should be housed in a state hospital not prison.  The adjudication based on mental defect or based on incompetence indicates  diminished capacity and as such relays the idea that said individual is in need of psychiatric care. At the same time, the state has a responsibility to care for other types of mental health patients who are in need of care. Despite the fiscal burden that state hospital may pose on the state, I believe it is far more beneficial for PWMI to access care through a state run psychiatric facility than inadequate care by way of the prison system.  I believe what I am saying is simply this, the most appropriate role for state hospital is to provide care for every PWMI who is in need of care, forensic patients"
1936,"Great post Robert! I agree I believing using state hospitals to house mostly or only forensic patients places a large population with PWMI at a disadvantage -they may be left without care. As a result, balance should be exercised and other populations who are in need of psychiatric care should have access to these facilities.  "
1937,"Great post Natalie! I agree with your stance, state hospitals should have residential programs that facilitates continuum of care instead of functioning as psychiatric prisons for the forensic population. I believe the state has a responsibility to serve all  mental health populations and not just the population mandated by the court to receive psychiatric care (forensic patients)."
1938,"Great post Jennifer! I too believe that using state hospitals to primarily house forensic patients leave other PWMI underserved. PWMI should not be housed in prisons and jails, they should have access to state hospitals which I believe are more equipped to cater to their needs."
1939,"I appreciate the suggestions regarding being compliant re: sharing protect health information (PHI) for PWMI. I believe the idea to create a website that informs Criminal Justice professions is essentially in becoming and remaining compliant. In addition, I believe having PWMI meet the person who continue their care prior to their release is important. In addition, having that individual inform PWMI re: that their health information will be maintained with confidence is a great way to build trust and long term relationship. I believe how data is share is integral to PWMI being motivated with continuing care after being released."
1940,"The CIT approach seems more therapeutic. The responding officer showed concern, services were offered to both parties involved - both the person having the episode and the family member.  The approach de-escalated the situation rather than heightened it. I believe a routine law enforcement approach is concerned mainly with  public safety, de-escalating the issue by making an arrest and taking the individual to jail, there is no room for empathy and getting a deeper understanding of the situation."
1941,I believe it takes a court ruling to institute this change because the department of corrections takes a penal approach directed by upholding public safety rather than a public health approach - caring for and providing essential services for PWMI.
1942,"The prison environment is very different from a hospital environment. As a result, clinicians will have to adjust to this environment. The prison environment is penal/arbitrary and this can create the idea that clinicians are there as a part of the team issuing justice and casting judgement on PWMI. Clinicians will need to work harder to gain trust of PWMI.  I believe cross training with correctional agencies will inform clinicians about the prison environment, such as its policies and procedures regarding safety of the prison population as well as the clinicians and other staff. Training will also assist clinicians in identifying possible challenges they may need to overcome while working with PWMI in a penal environment."
1943,"Criminal Justice professionals can benefit from training that educate them about the various mental illness, their symptoms, how they are treated and also the signs that indicate that PWMI are in crisis. I believe this will assist CJ professionals with responding to PWMI who are in crisis. Hence, instead of taking a penal approach - take control of the situation by any means necessary, they will understand how to best de-escalate the situation in a manner that is both safe for themselves and for others including the person in crisis. I guess in a nutshell, my idea of the essential training criminal justice professionals should receive is crisis response (how to identify signs that PWMI are in crisis, the difference between each episode based on the type of mental illness and how to handle the situation when PWMI are in crisis). In addition, I believe crisis management should be included as a separate module. Why? training criminal justice professionals on how to assess, and handle crisis I believe is basic training. Crisis management should include how to handle situations that escalates and continue to escalate - this can help when responding to PWMI who have chronic mental illness and may pose a danger to themselves and others. I believe this is important because criminal justice professionals are trained to serve and protect hence if situation gets out of hand, they may revert to that training. Hence, crisis management is essential as it will soften the edges and maybe even broaden the line between the compassion that the behavioral profession has towards PWMI and the arbitrary manner that the criminal justice system views them. In addition, mental health professionals should be trained on the basics of the criminal justice system. They need to be exposed to criminal justice system response training - how police officers  are trained to respond to 911 calls, how correction officers are trained to respond to disruptions in prisons and lastly how probation/parole officers are trained to  monitor PWMI who are on probation/parole. I believe this is essential as it will educate mental health professionals re:  the trauma that PWMI may experience via their interaction with criminal justice system. This will be helpful to those clinicians who have to work in the prison system and also to mental health professions who will provide continued care for PWMI who interacted with the criminal justice system.  To conclude, criminal justice professio"
1944,"Great post Sayla! I agree training is essential for CJ professionals as it will help reduce the number of incidents between officers and PWMI. Training will benefit all parties involved, as it will protect the safety of the officers, PWMI and the wider public.  Likewise, I believe mental health professionals should get training as well to help them understand the circumstances under which PWMI exist when they interact with the CJ system so they can better assist them through treatment/therapy. "
1945,Great post Alyse! I believe that training is essential for mental health professions especially those who will be responsible for continued care of PWMI when they are released from prison/jail. I believe the exchange between PWMI and mental health professions who treat them upon release will rely heavily on the understanding/knowledge mental health professionals have regarding the issues PWMI may have encountered while in prison/jail.
1946,It is easier to channel non-violent offenders into treatment programs as with treatment these individuals can re-enter society and lead productive lives. Violent offenders may pose a danger to themselves and others and may require more long term care.  If these patients are a threat to public safety then they should become forensic patients.
1947,"I believe the hurdles are different for criminal justice agencies as they are equipped to operate on a different model than mental health agencies. I believe the CJ model is primarily focused on public safety meanwhile mental health agencies are primarily focused on public health. Both models view the word rehabilitation differently, for the CJ agencies, rehabilitation is more penal and punishment based but for mental health patients it is focused on care and equipping patients to be become functional. This may be done through both medication as well as  therapeutic behavioral therapy. As a result each agency will face different obstacles. CJ agencies may face obstacles related to proving proper care to PWMI while mental health agencies may face safety issues regarding how to successfully monitor the actions of PWMI who become violent."
1948,"I believe providing an integrated approach to both mental health and substance abuse problems for PWMI would lead to lower recidivism rates and hence reduce reoccurring contact between PWMI and the justice system.  In addition, an integrated approach could be employed by prison officials who could create treatment programs within prisons as well as create programs that create pathways to such treatment programs. A situation that  would be beneficial to PWMI in prisons and may likely reduce the population as many PWMI could re-enter society as functional individuals."
1949,"Given that stigma can also be personal. Society tells people with mental illness that they are less than,  and PWMI believe and stigmatize themselves based on their illness, peer mentoring can assist in alleviating self stigmatization. Speaking to someone who has had similar experiences and can relate to what they are going through will allow PWMI to open up more about their illness without fear of feeling judged as a result, self stigma may be gradually reduced. Likewise, seeing another person with mental health issues overcoming those issues may be beneficial to PWMI as it promotes the growth of their self esteem as well as provide the motivation needed to continue treatment."
1950,"I cannot envision the recommendations provided in the Position paper being successfully integrated in the criminal justice system.  As the paper presented some reservations about its successful implementation in the primary care setting. According to Crowley & Kirschner (2015) some of the barriers than may impact fully implementing recommendations in the primary care setting includes both administrative and financial barriers.  To expound, the article states that primary care doctors generally lack adequate clinical mental health training. As a result, practitioners in both health care professions (primary care and mental health professions) practice very differently.  The article also noted a difference between how the structures for physical health, mental health and substance abuse care are regulated which can complicate the integration of these three treatment platforms into one single model. Based on these reservations, I cannot see how the justice system that  facilitate successful implementation of these recommendations to treat PWMI. The CJ system operates on a totally different model than any of the healthcare models previously discussed as it is modeled to suit public safety rather than public health. The deterrents that I believe will prevent these recommendations  from being successfully implemented into the justice system are the same as those stipulated by Crowley & Kirschner (2015). I see the cost of implementing these recommendations in penal systems (I consider CJ system to be a penal system) that were not previously design to operate in a manner that the recommendations would require. If there are concerns between the difference between how primary care physicians operated versus how mental health professionals operation, although they are both in the business of care then those concerns should multiply where the criminal justice system is concerned.  If the primary care  and the mental health care environments are so different the prison and jail environments will even be more different. Therefore the culture clashes that may result from integrating primary care and mental health medicine will translate into more of a blatant disagreement in a penal environment. Likewise, criminal justice practitioners have zero training in clinical mental heath and as discussed in class many criminal justice system agencies are lacking the resources needed to provide quality care for the mentally ill.  In terms of administrati"
1951,"Great post Viviana! I was a bit pessimistic regarding implementing the recommendations to treat PWMI in the CJ. Mostly because of the regulatory, financial and administrative concerns that were expressed in the articles. In addition, since we have learn throughout this course that CJ struggles to provide quality care for PWMI, I believe it would be wishful thinking to believe that successful implementation of these recommendations to treat PWMI is even possible. The CJ medicates PWMI instead of providing therapeutic treatment because if is more cost efficient and even so we have learnt through this course that some PWMI such as the chronically mentally ill falls through the cracks."
1952,"Great post Alyse, I think I may be the scrooge of these recommendations. I believe that creating programs that channel PWMI outside of the CJ system and into treatment programs that exist in the right treatment environment would be more effective. My concerns are primarily based on cost, compliance with regulatory requirements for each healthcare model and lastly the environment in which care will be administered. During the past weeks we have learnt how prison and jail conditions can exacerbate mental health symptoms, hence my question is can PWMI be successfully treated in the CJ and will this treatment provide the desired outcome if PWMI continue to being exposed to situations that will exacerbate their symptoms? I don't think so."
1953,"What could have prevented Timothy Souders's death is having mentally competent psychiatrists in the prison to prevent these kinds of tragedies from happening. They stated that the psychiatrist was on a leave of absence. With the prison system being the largest psychiatric system, there should have been a replacement or an understudy to take the place of the psychiatrist at leave. It is unreasonable in general to think that one psychiatrist can manage an entire prison by themselves. There should be psychological help and advisors available 24/7 in the prison system. These people are still people despite being in jail; they deserve help if it is needed. In addition to this, proper training for prison guards would have given them the ability to identify these psychological warning signs. Timothy Souders's death was 100% preventable if the personnel had adequate mental health training. "
1954,"Non-medical considerations have had a very strong sway on the treatment of people with mental illness. As far back as 8,000 years ago, the belief of spirits causing mental illness drove people to drill holes in the skulls of those who were mentally ill even though this has no scientific backing to it. These were different times, however, and technological and scientific advances were few and far between. Even the father of medicine, Hippocrates, believed in just using laxatives to rid the body of impurities that caused mental illness. It was as late as Civil War times when people still believed illness of the mind was not a scientific issue, but one of morality. Science has had an incredibly large impact on the modern medicine and modern treatments that we have today for those with mental illnesses. Without these scientific advancements, it is unpleasant to think about the possible ramifications that spiritual and religious beliefs would have on the treatment of mentally ill individuals."
1955,"I do not believe that this registry is more beneficial than the costs of it. While I do not think those with mental illness should have access to guns, this is for their safety, not because I think they would cause gun violence. This would be using the mentally ill as a scapegoat for the problems with violence, specifically gun violence, in the United States. The belief that the mentally ill are violent is simply an uneducated stance. Mentally ill people do not commit the majority of violent crimes in the United States, so why should they be the ones specifically targeted by this registry? It would simply appease the uneducated public that believes the mentally ill are at the root of the problem for the large amount of gun violence. However, the rate of gun violence would be largely unaffected as we know that there would still be a high availability to acquire a gun for those who are not listed on this registry. This registry would waste a countless amount of resources and make those who are mentally ill feel stigmatized for no reason since the likely reason behind the registry would be to stop unwanted violence - it would make little to no difference if mentally ill people were completely barred via registry from purchasing firearms. This registry might make a few people sleep better at night, but it will not largely change anything overall. For that reason, I think a registry for the mentally ill is a just a bandage that will calm the public temporarily while the real issue is ignored."
1956,"In my opinion, I think the most important problem to fix is the education of the general public on mentally ill persons. A large amount of the public is afraid of people with mental illness because they assume that they are dangerous to themselves and to others. This is not true and these beliefs greatly change the way mentally ill people are treated. As stated in the TED talk, including the mentally ill in society is actually more beneficial to them than the isolation that they currently face. Simple things such as work trainings on the mentally ill or even basic media techniques to reach a large audience to inform them of the unlikely dangerousness of mentally ill people would bring about change in how mentally ill people are perceived. This education could change the opportunities that those with mental illness have, giving their lives more meaning and purpose than they might have had. Ostracizing mentally ill people because people are fearful of them only exacerbates the problem. Education would not only change the way people view the mentally ill, but it could have substantial benefits on those with mental illness. "
1957,"Throughout the centuries, mentally ill people have been treated as second-class citizens. 8,000 years ago, those who were mentally ill were subjected to trephination, in which holes were created in the skull through bone removal in order for spirits to be released. These spirits were thought to be the cause of the mental illness experienced by the sufferers. In ancient civilizations, persons with mental illness were actually treated in a much more dignified way than those with mental illness during the Renaissance and before the Civil War. Throughout the Renaissance period, the Bethlam Royal Hospital came into existence. While this was a hospital for the mentally ill, those of upper class standing could pay a fee to come and view those with mental illness. Such as animals in a zoo, mentally ill persons were looked upon for entertainment purposes. We would not look upon those with physical ailments as if they were devices for our entertainment, yet those with mental illness during the Renaissance era were looked upon in exactly this manner. Lessening their worth as individual human beings and blatantly disrespecting them. This was followed by state hospitals here in the United States. While the idea itself was positive, the way it was handled left much to be desired in regards of patient care. People did not want the hospitals for the mentally ill anywhere near them, thus causing the hospitals to be built in remote locations. This isolation from general society would have negative impacts on the mentally ill. As they were moved farther and farther away from the public, it created an invisible wall between the public and the mentally ill. The fear and disregard the public had for the mentally ill continued the view of them being as second-class citizens. They were still not considered to be full-fledged members of society because they were not allowed to be part of society. They were secluded and put away. This sort of out of sight, out of mind behavior indeed had negative implications on mentally ill citizens, because they were treated as less than citizens. Mentally ill patients were treated terribly and some were even killed without much, if any, backlash from the general public. Today, those who suffer from mental illness are treated as prisoners, and prisoners are often treated poorly as they have violated the social norms created by society. Despite all the advances in knowledge of the human brain and of mental illness, many American"
1958,"Hi Nani! Great post! I too said that education is such an important factor when dealing with people with mental illness. As we saw in one of the lecture videos, a man with major depressive disorder died in prison because of his refusal to drink water. If this were someone who was sick and unable to physically drink water, then an IV would have been given to replenish the lost fluids. However, for the mentally ill patient, the refusal of water was ignored despite it being common knowledge that dehydration is fatal. If the corrections officers were better educated on the dangers of mental illness, then they would have known to take that inmate to the infirmary for an IV. Mental illness is as serious as any other chronic illness such as diabetes, yet it is treated as if it is a non-serious issue."
1959,"Hi Jennifer! Awesome post! I think that as knowledge of mental illness has evolved, so has the view of them being members of society. While they are more widely viewed as members of society, the issue now is the fear people have of the mentally ill. Without awareness and statistical information in regards to how mentally ill people actually behave, the fears that people have over the mentally ill will continue. There is only a small percentage of those with mental illness that are violent, yet society generalizes that most people with mental illness are violent, therefore cementing their status as less than equal. It is without the proper education that people who are mentally ill will continue to be seen as second-class. We have made tremendous progress over the years, but there is still a long way to go!"
1960,"A president can be effective in bringing about an end to stigma because talking about it on a national scale opens the conversation to local levels. If people were ashamed or felt alone in their issues with mental health or with dealing with the mental health of others, they now know it is a widespread issue. This could ultimately lead to people seeking help for themselves. By pushing the issue to end mental health stigma, it becomes a national movement. Local people will begin to see more about mental health as advocates begin to educate the masses and as the conversation itself is commented on by various news outlets. The leader of the free world discussing mental illness breaks down barriers and elevates the seriousness of the problem. The president would not be speaking about something unless it is of great concern or it is affecting people on a national scale. "
1961,"The movement toward reducing benefits for mental health care quite frankly says that policymakers do not care about mental health care. It isn't something that seems to be on their priority list despite a wide range of psychological issues facing people in the United States today. Clearly they are more focused on ailments that are physical in nature rather than those that are psychological. Due to it not being an illness you can see, an illness that can spread, or an illness that is fatal in itself, the policymakers do not believe it is urgent. Policymakers believe that the clients that need care are the ones that you can see need care or have a curable illness. Because mental illness can be managed but not cured, I think there is a lack of a sense of urgency to provide funding to mental health care. It follows a thought pattern that seems to be only focused on the illnesses they can get rid of while mental illness is an ""out of sight, out of mind"" issue. However, we know how much mental illness affects the lives of sufferers, so it is very disheartening to know that they frankly do not seem to care about this widespread issue."
1962,"Based on the account of the veteran in the above video, early-intervention is key in order to give soldiers the proper coping skills while they are in the military. He mentioned that many turned to drugs or alcohol, however, providing something such as a mandatory support group could possibly prevent soldiers from turning to these negative coping mechanisms. Upon returning home, military members should be required to attend two or three of these support meetings, then be tested to see if they have PTSD or not. This gives those who are experiencing PTSD a chance to receive help while normalizing support groups for the rest of military members, decreasing the stigma that can be associated with them. For veterans, there needs to be more widely available and free options for seeking help in support groups as well as readily available psychological help for severe sufferers. These need to be widely advertised so veterans of all socioeconomic status know of their existence. Until medication with less side effects are available, I do not think it should be the immediate go-to in cases of military PTSD for the safety of veterans."
1963,"Society should be allowed to step in severe cases, but I think stepping in for every case is invasive and can actually scare people away further from seeking help. People have a right to privacy and a right to their own bodies and minds. When they begin to pose a threat to themselves or others, it then begins to be necessary in order to protect both persons with mental illness as well as the public so they do not feel the need to further stigmatize people who suffer from mental illness. It is important we protect the mentally ill from harming themselves, but we also need to remember their privacy is just as important as the privacy of those who do not suffer from mental illness and it also needs to be protected."
1964,"As with a lot of things, I firmly believe that early intervention is key in decreasing the stigma for the mentally ill. During elementary school, we had assemblies about being kind to one another to prevent bullying as it is a prevalent issue facing children today. However, mental illness is also a large issue but one that is not talked about. In order to target children of an elementary school age, people would come in and read books or artists would show and discuss their works and sometimes do example paintings or drawings to inspire children to combat bullying. I think the same needs to be done for mental illness. In this way, it is a fun way to learn about mental illness that can actually engage children of a young age instead of just talking to them directly. What is memorable for children are things that are fun, things that they will go home and tell their parents about. Through creativity or activities, children will learn about mental illness and not just forget about what they were told because they are able to be involved. Involvement in creative activities makes children be present and involved in their current situations, which allows them to absorb the information given. For middle school and high school, teens are able to handle a lot more serious information than those in elementary school. I do not think it is wise to overload this information in just one or two assemblies. Education is key to normalizing mental illness. As with the case of physical health classes, mental health classes need to be implemented in order to normalize mental illness as well as help those who may be suffering from a mental illness that they do not know about. These classes should be the same as any other health class because we are trying to normalize mental illness, not make it feared or frowned upon. In health class, we discussed the public ailment of one of the principals who had ALS. In this way, it informed us more about his illness as well as normalized it for us so we understood what he was experiencing while knowing we should not fear his illness was contagious or any harm to us. The same should be done with mental illness. Providing insight into mental illness gives understanding where we may not have it, and makes it a more comfortable topic to discuss openly. "
1965,"Great post, Alyse!  I absolutely agree that education is key to normalizing mental illness and decreasing the stigma that is associated with it. I think getting children that are of an elementary school age up and involved in the discussion through activities that they really have to focus on and be involved in is imperative to early intervention tactics. Children are most interested in things when they are involved and having fun. In addition to making it a fun activity, associating discussing mental illness with having fun makes it a more comfortable topic amongst children as they go into their teens. I also really appreciated your insight into how the difficulty of the curriculum should increase as children grow into teens. This makes the learning challenging, rewarding, and more thorough then rehashing the same topics over and over. "
1966,"Awesome post, Steve! I could not emphasize that normalcy is learned just like stigma is. If we want to decrease the stigma associated with mental illness, we have to combat it by teaching children acceptance and later more detailed facts as they grow into teens. I think getting children that are of all ages involved and giving them more fun ways to learn will also help them to absorb the information better. We do not want them to brush off the information or think it is boring, so it needs to be fully engaging to maximize the retention of the information. Making things fun associates positivity with it, further normalizing the criteria in the class."
1967,"Tests can be more sensitive, but ultimately this will decrease the specificity. If someone is diagnosed with a mental illness using a test, but that test is very sensitive, it is less able to prove that a positive result is true, thus meaning mental health workers are less able to prove that the person in question has a specific mental illness. False positives may force people into institutions where they do not belong. This is unfair to the person in treatment and will ultimately build a sense of mistrust between the public and the mental healthcare system. False negatives would also decrease this trust as people who are severely mentally ill would be placed back onto the streets without the needed medical care. This would push the public to believe that there are incompetencies within the mental healthcare system. Both of these scenarios lead to mistrust and doubt in the care for the mentally ill and may drive people away from seeking help altogether."
1968,"In my opinion, it is beneficial for sexually violent predators to be involuntarily committed after they serve their sentences. Being sexually deviant is a mental issue that needs to be addressed. Serving time in a prison is not going to help them with their mental illness, it may actually exacerbate the problem. In order to receive the treatment they need to be functional members of society, they need commitment to an institution. It is through involuntary commitment that they may find help and be able to handle their mental illness. We cannot send these people back out into society without the proper tools needed to cope with their illness and the tools to not act upon their urges. Prison is punitive, not rehabilitative. Despite their wrongdoings, they should receive treatment."
1969,"Inpatient commitment is the definite larger reach of state authority into an individual's lives. For outpatient treatment, people are able to continue their normal day-to-day lives within the community. Inpatient commitment can be extremely coercive because the mentally ill do not want to be contained in a hospital and unfamiliar environment, surrounded by people they do not know. This can build resentment between the patients and the mental health care system. While they are in inpatient commitment, they are forced to take medications and do not have many freedoms. We also know that inpatient commitment has been discriminatory. More people of color are committed than whites; it is in debate whether or not people of color actually do have higher rates of mental illness or not. While in custody, African Americans are more likely to be dealt with by coercive behavior. This is a direct infringement on their freedom to be treated equally as they are being handled in a more cruel manner."
1970,"Inpatient commitment, while being coercive, does allow people to receive mental health care in desperate times. They are taken away from their homes and lives and forced into an unfamiliar environment. This happens whether they want the help or not and can build a sense of distrust and fear with authorities and the mental healthcare system. If someone develops a fear of the mental healthcare system, they are less likely to further seek out treatment in the future because of this resentment built up between them. Outpatient commitment, while still allowing those to have their freedoms, can be stigmatizing and actually infringe upon their civil liberties. Outpatient commitment does increase the compliance rate for those who are ill that need to take medication, but it does so in a coercive manner. Once again, this can build resentment and frustration. If the medication does not entirely help because medication regimens are not always right the first few times, persons who are commitment in an outpatient manner may deem the system incapable of helping them, pushing them further away from the treatment they may desperately need. The appropriate measures of success for these treatments are becoming functional, re-integrated members of society who are able to cope properly with their mental illness. This will happen through finding the right medication combination as well as a level of self-acceptance that they need mental health help and/or are mentally ill. It is important for people who are mentally ill to understand that their illness is not their fault and that help is available. They are not different or lesser members of society because of their illness. In addition to this, individuals should be able to find employment when they are out on their own, and there should be services that help them to obtain jobs."
1971,"Great post, Liisa! I was thinking on a much smaller, immediate gratification scale for the signs of success, so I really appreciate you bringing the idea of large scale success to my attention. A reduction in rates of repeated hospitalization and inpatient/outpatient commitment would certainly be a sign of success for society. I believe that on a personal level, understanding the mental illness that they have as well as having the proper coping skills and/or medication regimen would be signs of success as they are integrated back into society and are able to gain employment, sustain themselves, and ultimately live their lives with freedom and dignity! "
1972,"I definitely agree that education is a huge issue in terms of the successes of the lives of those who are mentally ill, Briana! As you said, it reduces stigma in the lives of mentally ill individuals. They will be less fearful to seek out mental health treatment as well as reduce the shame they may feel after being diagnosed as mentally ill. In addition to this, personal sustainability would be a good sign that someone was successfully treated. We know a lot of people who are mentally ill are unable to properly care for themselves. If they were able to maintain employment and eventually be able to have their own place of living, that would be a fantastic sign for success in those who are mentally ill. Great job!"
1973,"The stage that I believe would be most difficult to PWMI would be the entering of the system and interviews. The officers or detectives doing the interviews may not know how to handle people with mental illness, leaving the person with mental illness vulnerable. Through coercion or threats, someone with a mental illness may feel pressured to admit to a crime that they did not commit. They may also not understand the severity of the charges and not ask for a lawyer, answering the questions asked of them that could later be used against them in the trial. Being in a new environment while being hounded with questions would be extremely difficult for anyone, but it becomes an even greater level of difficulty when someone has a mental illness."
1974,"A definite challenge for persons with mental illness is the availability of mental health care in the system. Since they are placed within county jails for some offenses, the county jails do not have the necessary funds to treat these inmates with mental illness. The stress from being in jail could exacerbate their mental illness further, which could lead to them acting unruly and possibly getting additional time because of this. A benefit is, with county jails, they do not have to relocate somewhere far and away from their families or people they know. They will still be in the county they committed a crime in and not transferred somewhere completely new. In addition to this, people with mental illness would not be around violent offenders who could potentially harm them."
1975,"It is not fair to be placed in a situation in which you do not have the knowledge, training, or resources to handle a situation in a professional manner. Unfortunately, police officers are not required to have training in order to deal with persons with mental illness, meaning they go into these situations blindly. Without the proper knowledge, it is very unfair for them to be expected ti handle these situations and handle them properly at that. "
1976,"CIT's main focus is to ensure the safety of the officers who are dealing with persons who are mentally ill. Because of this, it is clear that the stigma that mentally ill people are violent has influenced the training in some way. If the safety of the officer is first, and not the safety of the mentally ill person, then it is clear that they believe mentally ill people can be violent. However, I do understand this is needed in order to protect those who are officers as they too need protection. In addition to this, after training, the number of shootings of persons with mental illness has decreased. I believe this may be related to the decrease in stigma. Officers who have had the training understand that situations with mentally ill people need to be de-escalated and can be calmed down. Officers are prepared to handle the situation and are therefore more calm when dealing with someone with mental illness."
1977,"Based on the results found by Taheri, I think the CIT model for persons with mental illness should continue to be used. Despite showing null effects, there were limitations to the study. The biggest change that I think needs to be made is the option of CIT training. This training should not be an option, it should be mandatory. As noted in the article, having CIT training be an option could have skewed the results . If someone chooses to be part of a program, and that program of volunteers is studied, it is not randomized thus affecting the results seen. At first, officers need to be randomly selected to attend training, then results should be retrieved from those random officers after implementing the training in the field, excluding those who previously volunteered. That is a more accurate and scientific way we would see the effects of CIT training on officers and persons with mental illness injuries, arrest rates, and more. I think the study determined null effects because there also wasn't enough data to draw conclusions from. For example, conclusions were not drawn for injury because there simply was not enough reports - only two of the seven studies actually included information about injuries. In order to determine the true affects of CIT training, there needs to be more training done at random. As there were no negative results found in the study, I believe it should be tested and officers should continue to be trained until there is enough data to undertake a thorough study on CIT training. Thorough reporting must also be done in order to have detailed data in which researches can use to determine results."
1978,"Great post, Briana! We had very similar thoughts on this. The study itself was very limited and, to me, there is not enough data to draw conclusions on whether or not this training is working in the system. The only way we can know for sure is if more studies are done, which requires more data, which requires more CIT training to occur. I also think this training should be randomized in order to prevent the results from being skewed. The lowering of stigma is so important, especially with persons in law enforcement. We do not want those who are there to help to be fearful or have a misconception about persons with mental illness as this could lead to avoidable tragedies. "
1979,"Really insightful post, Steve! I appreciate that you went to this training and can give all of us an insight into it that we may not have had. I also think that in addition to finding ways to making it more effective, we need to make it more scientific. As of now, officers are volunteering to take this training and that can skew data. In order to see the most reliable and valid effects, training needs to be randomized and those randomly selected officers need to be the ones who are observed for study. While this will take time and resources, I think it is the best way to determine how well the CIT training works. Would you say the training has helped you in areas of law enforcement other than just interactions with persons of mental illness?"
1980,"Being jailed over 100 times must be incredibly frustrating, demeaning, and disappointing. At that point in time, the person being jailed must know the routine of being arrested so the situation is not novel, however, after 100 times that person still has not been given significant help to better their situation. They would be losing hope in the system that has failed them because they have been caught in the cycle and are unable to get out of it. I think it is a hopeless situation and just eventually becomes a way of life for them. However, they know that in the jail they will receive food, shelter, and possibly their needed medications. Jail might also be an escape for them to get off the streets and receive some form of treatment and care. In that situation, jail would become a resource, so committing petty crimes would be a way of survival."
1981,"  Entries into jails. If someone with a mental illness is taken into custody multiple times, it is important that law enforcement figures out why. Through keeping track of the total entries of a person into jail, police can then interview that person and see what their motives are behind the crimes they commit. After several times, a possible pattern could emerge. This pattern could then be used to prevent future arrests by offering that person resources to help their situation. Medications previously taken for mental illness. Over time, this could become critical in determining which drugs for mental health help that person and which are ineffective. While this is already accounted for, it is crucial that these medications are compared and contrasted with one another to determine a correct treatment plan. Again, jails could point to a necessary resource that could help the person with mental illness. Living situation. Jails tracking the whereabouts of people with mental illness can give researchers an estimate of how many people with mental illness are, for example, homeless. This could lead to policy changes that will ultimately affect the majority of mentally ill people overall. Changing policies or creating new policies could help more than just the person who is currently in jail."
1982,"Inmates are given various rights. They are able to practice their religions, protected against cruel punishment and sexual assault. However, just because they have these rights does not mean that these rights are respected. The rights that they are given are not exactly the rights that are respected in prisons. It is possible there are unreported sexual assaults and instances of cruel punishment or violence that are simply brushed under the rug. The right to practice religion freely could also be infringed upon by other inmates. Violence against those who practice a different religion or racial targeting may still happen. One right I do think that jail inmates should have is compensation for their work. If working while incarcerated, they should receive some form of compensation that they can use outside and an amount that can be useful upon release."
1983,"While money is a valuable resource, one of the most valuable resources that might rank higher than money is time. With the number of people entering the system, medical providers need to see a large volume of patients in a short period of time. To make this easier, they prescribe medications and send inmates on their way, appeasing them and the correctional officers with this quick fix solution, despite not all medications working well for every person. When you are dealing in a high stress environment that is very demanding, you want to do things in the most efficient way possible. Unfortunately, medical providers are seeing the prescribing of medication as the easiest and efficient method. They chat with the inmate for a few minutes, determine their possible mental illness, and send them on their way with a prescription. It is a way to maximize patients seen and conserve the resource of time."
1984,"Torrey, Kennard, Eslinger, Lamb, and Pavle (2010) assert that there are more people with mental illness in the prison system than there are in mental hospitals. Unfortunately, jails are not designed to care for people with mental illness as they are designed as punishment for offenders of minor drug and property offenses. After realignment, the jails were flooded with offenders for these minor crimes, increasing the number of inmates residing in county jails. As stated in this week's lectures, jails are often more problematic than prisons. This is due to the wide variety of people that are held in jails, the small spaces they are put in, and the constant in-and-out of inmates. To someone with a mental illness, this can be incredibly stressful and, as we know, constant change is already extremely overwhelming for someone without a mental illness. Coupled with the fact that people who enter jails being worse off than those entering prison, it would be incredibly difficult for someone who suffers from a mental illness to find the much needed stability they require to improve. Jails were already understaffed and underfunded and, when realignment happened, this added more inmate volume to the cramped environments. The jails were not structurally built to house the inmates placed within them after realignment - they lack the capacity and space. The lack of staff would make it difficult to handle those with various mental illnesses while simultaneously keeping track of other inmates. With at least 16% of inmates having some form of serious mental illness, this leaves at most 84% of other inmates without mental illness that the jail has to manage simultaneously (Torrey, Kennard, Eslinger, Lamb & Pavle, 2010). As previously stated, realignment would inflate the number of people in the jail, adding continued stress to the officers who are expected to keep watch over everyone. The underfunding of jails could lead to lack of proper medical treatment. As discussed in the lectures, many jail physicians prescribe medication to the mentally ill instead of giving them extensive care. With more inmates taking up the financial resources, this could prove to be detrimental to those who are suffering from mental illness who require extensive patient care and medication in order to live functionally within society. The funds only go so far, therefore some of the people with mental illness may go without their desperately needed medication. While the jails provide a roof"
1985,"Fantastic post, Elise! You mentioned that there should be referrals for mentally ill before they are arrested, so, in your opinion, if someone with a mental illness committed a crime, should they not be arrested at all? There's definitely a fear I have that some people will use that to their benefit and claim mental illness or the need for mental health assistance in order to get out of charges. Police definitely need more training in order to identify people who actually have mental illness and how to handle these situations. A lot of mental health situations escalate and end negatively; those with mental illness are at risk of being hurt by police due to the symptoms they are displaying. Jails are definitely not the right place for PWMI, and, after realignment, it is an even more unstable of an environment for them to be involved in. The large amount of inmates could be extremely stressful and exacerbate their symptoms."
1986,"Awesome post, Steve! I definitely agree 100% that jails are not the appropriate place to house the mentally ill. After realignment, they became even more crowded and cramped. This can add a large amount of stress to those who are suffering from a mental illness as well as the staff at the jail. It is very unnerving to think that someone who stole something small could be in the same room as someone who committed a violent assault. With the jails becoming more full, doctors and nurses in jail will likely have a lot more patients to attend to. My fear is that those who suffer from mental illness and were not violent, will not be seen as immediately as they need to be and therefore will have to continue to wait on their medication. The prolonging of medical treatment and the high stress environment could essentially intensify the symptoms the person with mental illness is experiencing. They may get a lot worse before they get better unfortunately. "
1987,"It is unfair to solely use risk assessment tools due to their lack of accuracy. However, I think they should be used in combination with other assessments, such as professional mental health assessments to determine the risk an offender has of recidivism. To use just a risk assessment could extend time for someone who is not going to commit another crime or release someone who is going to commit another crime. Risk assessments do not give an entire view of an individual and their likelihood to commit additional crimes so it is important that they are not used on their own or, that they are refined to increase their accuracy of assessing risk."
1988,"Mental health professionals would be open to the RNR approach if it had more research to back it up. We know from the lectures that RNR needs more research to support its efficacy.  Many mental health professionals are supportive of cognitive behavioral techniques so that part of the RNR approach they would certainly stand behind. Focusing on criminogenic needs such as substance abuse and antisocial behaviors would also be supported by mental health professionals because these are deviant behaviors that need to be addressed to decrease criminal acts. In addition to this, substance abuse can exacerbate symptoms and addiction can be incredibly hard to overcome, so mental health professionals would want to work on that with PWMI. Other factors they might be concerned about is relapse into drug use, self harm, the harming of others, and not taking their prescribed medication."
1989,"Probation is set up to cause a ""behavior change"" in the offender. However, the video does not mention specific training that would help PWMI. While they may help people to change, you cannot handle a case with someone who has mental illness the same way you would handle a case with someone who does not have mental illness. Probation officers need to be aware of resources that PWMI can access in order to keep their mental illness treated and, if that requires medication, probation officers need to help PWMI make the behavioral change of taking daily medication. It allows for a lot more freedom than jail and, in my opinion, allows PWMI to develop independence while still having some form of assistance. They are re-integrated into society with the help of the probation officer instead of spending a certain amount of time within a jail then released and expected to be able to be successful in society. Probation officers give PWMI and other offenders some very helpful resources."
1990,"As a participant in mental health court, I would feel more secure and understood than in traditional court. I would know that, despite the label, my mental health would be taken into consideration and I would get more help and access to services than I would get in traditional courts. My progress would be monitored so if things start to go awry, I would have the resources, help, and services I would not have in traditional courts to get back onto the right track. In the video, participants did not come back to the mental health court so therefore, my chances of success would be greater if I was in the mental health court. Treatment access would be available and so would services that would help to find housing and jobs all while working with the courts instead of working against them."
1991,"The “Risk Needs Responsivity” model means to focus on those offenders who are higher risk and also the criminogenic needs such as substance abuse and antisocial behavior. During the RNR model, services are provided to the offenders that are congruent with their type of learning style. Specific Responsivity should be avoided as it has very scattered evidence and does not have enough thorough backing to it per Skeem et al. (2015). Instead, cognitive behavioral therapy has shown promise for those who have mental illness and those who do not. Skeem, Steadman, and Manchak (2015) state that persons with mental illness and those who do not have mental illness have similar risk factors for recidivism. This means that the same risk factors that probation officers work to reduce with offenders on probation in general can be reduced in those with mental illness as well. Therefore, working with someone who is mentally ill should be the same in regards to reduction of risk factors. In order to reduce recidivism rates, probation officers need to ensure that those on probation with mental illness are involved in some form of cognitive behavioral therapy as it is supported with scientific data that found it does reduce recidivism rates (Skeem et al., 2015). The RNR approach is positive in context, but it does not have empirical support. In order to meet the needs of rehabilitation and the reduction of recidivism in those on probation, the RNR should be considered but should not be the main guide to how probation officers should respond to those on probation who have mental illness. If probation officers want to help those who have mental illness, they need to focus on models that are supported, models that have backing. This would be cognitive behavioral therapy and symptom control. I mention symptom control, as it is imperative in the functioning in every day society. Without monitoring symptoms and making sure a specialist or medical professional is involved in treatment, it will impede the mentally ill from becoming productive members of society. This could be one of the services provided to those on probation, as mental health care will be needed for those returning to society. Chief Probation Officers need to follow the empirically supported ways to reduce recidivism to ensure that recidivism is actually reduced instead of relying that a model without empirical backing will help offenders with mental illness to not reoffend."
1992,"Great post, Nicolle! I found the video you included to be very informative as well. I think in order to reduce recidivism and really make a difference in the lives of those who are probation, empirically supported models need to be implemented. I think the RNR model needs to be followed loosely because risk does need to be responded to but in a way that we know can work. Addressing the symptoms of mental illness as well as cognitive behavioral therapy can be strong reducers in recidivism per Skeem et al. (2015). By reducing the mental illness symptoms and working with a mental health care professional, those who have mental illness that are on probation can regain structure in their lives and become productive members of society. In addition to this, reduction in symptoms can reduce moments of psychosis in which violence can occur. Cognitive behavioral therapy has been statistically supported to reduce recidivism as well, so I think making sure those on probation are involved in some form of cognitive behavioral therapy would be beneficial as well. "
1993,"Asia, Really insightful post! While I do agree that symptoms should not be a focus in regards to them being a cause for committing crimes, when we look at the bigger picture, controlling symptoms in those with mental illness can help them become integrated, productive members of society. Someone who is experiencing intense symptoms from a mental illness may not be able to handle the day-to-day trials that those without mental illness handle with ease. Because of this, I believe that symptoms do need to be addressed and are important in the rehabilitation process. While probation officers should not assume that these symptoms are the cause of criminal behavior, they can be the cause of other difficulties in a mentally ill person's life that prevent them from living productive lives. Without the symptoms of mental illness, someone may be able to gain and retain employment, thus enabling them to support themselves and improving their quality of life. I definitely agree that rehabilitation is a key solution as it will help those on probation, with and without mental illness, gain steady footing and reduce rates of future recidivism."
1994,"     The Risk-Need-Responsivity Model considers the unique needs of each individual prisoner to reduce recidivism rates. Though developed in the late 1900s, this model continues to offer personalized intervention methods to rehabilitate prisoners. Some of the most promising components of the RNR Model include its’ emphasis on general predictors for crime in the mentally ill, the importance of individualized treatment, and the ability to correct these criminal behaviors to reduce recidivism (Bonta & Andrews, 2006). According to this model, reducing recidivism begins with a rehabilitative perspective.     While this method seems reliable at first glance, Skeem et al. (2015) warns about the abrupt support for RNR when considering three main principles: risk, need, and responsivity. Skeem first claims about the risk of excluding low-risk individuals from recidivism-reducing programs. Though excluding this group from the target population may affect overall health and welfare this model focuses more heavily on public safety and thus, there is not enough data to remove low-risk individuals from these programs at this time. In terms of the needs principle, Skeem supports more individualized risk factors, considering homelessness and substance abuse as predictors for violence. Finally, in regard to the responsivity perspective, the authors suggest that there is an overwhelming lack of evidence to support the responsivity principle among the MI (Skeem et al., 2015).       With all of these considerations in mind, I would suggest that the Chief Probation Officer conduct more research on RNR’s effectiveness in treating the mentally ill. One suggestion could be to expand the RNR model to include low-risk offenders in combination with the target population of high-risk offenders (Wormith and Zidenberg, 2018). Providing better educational training programs for probation officers would also help supervisors to better understand the needs of mentally ill patients. With a more comprehensive understanding of the mentally ill’s needs, probation officers can apply more effective methods of supervision that are individually tailored. With this education, probation officers and offenders can foster a more mutually-beneficial relationship that includes both “fairness and toughness” (Slate et al., 2013). In applying these suggestions in combination with the RNR Model, probation officers can facilitate more effective supervision and care for MI on probation."
1995,"Hi Jennifer, I completely agree with you in regards to the individualized risk factors and treatment plans that must be considered. Overall, the evidence for the risk and needs perspectives of the RNR Model is lacking (Skeem et al., 2015). The mentally ill would be best reintegrated into society with personalized care from their probation officer, considering the triggers and individual care that the particular offender requires. Reducing recidivism rates begins with understanding the motives for criminal behavior and evaluating the most effective treatment methods to support that MI person. Further, the interaction between criminogenic needs and the mentally ill must be better understood to establish a comprehensive treatment plan. "
1996,"Hi Stephen, I found the format and content of your post to be very effective. The breakdown of this email clearly summarized each of your ideas and  I think that your suggestion of prolonged monitoring would greatly reduce recidivism. You addressed each of Skeem et. al's concerns and I too believe that more evidence is necessary to support the effectiveness of RNR. How do you think the 90-day, 180-day, and 1-year evaluation meetings would differ from one another? Would you expect to see constant changes in the program throughout the year? Overall a very well-written and informative post! "
1997,"One of the biggest issues in prions is overcrowding. Overcrowding would cause a large amount of stress for those with mental illness as it is claustrophobic and very loud. This may cause someone with mental illness to panic and harm themselves or others. Persons with mental illness may also be targets to violence from other inmates simply because of their condition. Another issue is solitary confinement which can increase the risk of suicidal ideation because they are alone and unable to talk about it with anyone. In addition to increasing suicidal ideation, it can also increase depression overall as well as anxiety. "
1998,"It is possible if those with mental illness are given more resources. They need to be attending some form of therapy whether it be group or individual for more severe cases. Those with mental illness need to be rehabilitated and reintegrated into society. They should be given not only mental health resources, but resources that will help them train for jobs and gain employment. We cannot expect to release someone who is mentally ill from prison, not give them the proper tools they need, and expect them to rehabilitate on their own. People with mental illness need continued care so providing them with community mental health centers would be a huge step in the right direction. As of now, they are mostly left to their own devices but, with the proper resources, they can definitely rehabilitate."
1999,"I think the advantages of solitary confinement are extremely outweighed by the disadvantages for the inmate. It my help officers to keep control of the inmates and to have a safer environment, but it is breaking down the minds of the inmates who are placed within solitary confinement. It is essentially reversing years worth of social skills that have been developed by the person in solitary. The brain has no stimulation which deteriorates the minds of even those who have no mental illness. It is a very inhumane form of punishment to be locked in a tiny cell for 23 hours per day with only one hour to stretch their legs essentially. They are basically treated like caged animals. "
2000,"I think using tax dollars towards treating mentally ill in prison is similar to an investment - the payoff will take time but is worth it. We know that those with mental illness tend to have higher rates of recidivism, so by treating their illness while they are in prison and providing resources for when they are out of prison, we can reduce the rates of recidivism that PWMI have. In addition to this, by providing them mental health care, we can prevent them from being involved in rule violations that extend their prison time. Less prison time means less we have to pay for their time spent in prison overall. As of now, states spend between 2.5% and 6% of prison budgets on mental health which is not a lot considering that 56.2% of all inmates have mental health problems. These people deserve the care that other prison inmates with chronic illness, such as diabetes, get."
2001,"Treatment for persons with mental illness that are incarcerated is an investment as I previously stated in one of my lecture responses. According to the lectures, 56.2% of all inmates have mental health problems and those with mental health problems are more likely to commit additional crimes and end up back in the prison system where taxpayer dollars will once again be funding their incarceration. In order to cut costs later, we must spend money on mental health treatment for those in the prison systems. By treating their symptoms now and giving them additional care, we can reduce their rate of recidivism when they are released from prisons or jails. While I do not think medical care should be taken away from any prison inmate as they all have a right to treatment, I do believe that the costs spent on those who are mentally ill could increase. As stated in the lectures, between 2.5% and 6% of state prison budgets are spent on mental health and a large component of this money is going towards medication. Medication should be implemented and more screenings for mental illness should take place to increase safety within the prison walls, as less than 80% of inmates are screened. More resources need to be allocated to increase that screening percentage to keep inmates and officers safe. According to Adams and Ferrandino (2008), one of the best ways to provide inmates with mental health treatment is through therapeutic communities where the environment is more positive than that of general population. These low stress environments reduced the symptoms that patients with mental illness were experiencing (Adams and Ferrandino, 2008). The reduction of symptoms could also lead to safer environments because it will reduce the harm caused by mentally ill individuals to themselves as well as staff members within the prison system. This is just one example of different mental health treatments other than medication that can be implemented in order to help those with mental illness. It is important to note, however, that Adams and Ferrandino (2008) state that relapse and recidivism were reduced if the prisoners with mental illness were also provided with after-care in their communities once they were released from prison. By developing after-care programs for those who have been to prison, it will not increase the costs required by prisons, but will actually decrease the cost required by preventing recidivism on the outside. Less recidivism means less inmates return"
2002,"Asia, Interesting post! I agree with you sentiments on the issue presented. I do not think that mentally ill inmates should be treated in the same manner as those without mental illness because they respond differently to their environment. As Adams and Ferrandino (2008) stated, therapeutic communities have a more positive effect on prisoners with mental illness and these communities also reduce their psychotic symptoms. Essentially, these communities can prevent the inmates with mental illness from having time added to their sentences because they are in a more comfortable environment where they do not feel unsafe, therefore they will not act out or break rules as they might in general population. With 56.2% of inmates experiencing mental health problems, more than 2.5% - 6% of prison budgets needs to be going to those who are mentally ill. "
2003,"Briana,  Very insightful post! I definitely agree with you that therapeutic environments would lead to positive changes for those suffering with mental illness who are in prisons as these environments have been shown to alleviate symptoms (Adams and Ferrandino, 2008). However, I do think that those with mental illness need to have more resources allocated to them. Creating special housing units as you suggested is a great idea, but it does require additional resources, so the allocation of these resources is needed. In addition to this, only 2.5% to 6% of prison budgets are spent on those who are mentally ill and a majority of this is spent on medication. In my opinion, these numbers are incredibly low considering that prisons are now the largest holder of mentally ill individuals in the United States. PWMI seem to be the lowest on the totem pole in prisons when it comes to resources and they definitely deserve more care. Great post!"
2004,"If I was a taxpayer and understood the implications that having a state hospital could have on the public, I would feel positive about the new state hospital. If those with mental illness are not placed into a hospital where they can obtain appropriate treatment and care, then they will likely end up in the criminal justice system. Once they are in the criminal justice system, it is hard for those with mental illness to escape the cycle. Due to this, taxpayers would actually end up paying for each time that someone with mental illness is taken into police custody and into a jail or prison. Either way the taxpayers money is going to be going towards the treatment of the mentally ill, so I would feel better if it was invested into something that could actually help the mental illness they are experiencing. "
2005,"I would absolutely not describe it as a ""get out of jail free"" card. It is rarely used so it is not necessarily a card that is actually in play. Overall, however, those who committed the crime are still paying for their crime. They are not out on the street and enjoying their lives, they are in a state hospital receiving intense care that they need. The process of being found not guilty by reason of insanity is time consuming and those who are using this defense are observed by multiple psychologists in order to see if they indeed have some form of mental illness that caused them to commit the crime in question. Those who are indeed mentally ill will receive the treatment they need in order to be reformed and become functional, healthy members of society instead of going to a prison where their symptoms may be exacerbated."
2006,"To ensure patient and staff safety, people need to be specifically employed and trained to handle issues when mentally ill patients are attacking staff or causing harm to themselves or other patients. Having the housekeeping help with dangerous situations is completely out of line considering they do not have the training for such a task and they did not apply to take on a job with such a task. There needs to be security staff trained in de-escalation techniques, trained in how to restrain someone without causing injury, and how to administer sedatives if needed in order to get violent patients calmed down. Staff should not have to work in fear and patients should not have to recover in fear. In addition to this, regular checks need to be made on the hospitals themselves to make sure there are no instances of sexual abuse or abuse in general towards the patients."
2007,"Using deep brain stimulation to treat depression is an intriguing process to me, especially since Edie was awake during her procedure. While they said patients are given a mild sedative, I wonder what their experience is like. Personally I would be terrified but, dealing with depression is incredibly hard and I understand her wanting to take that risk in order to feel better, in order to feel something other than dread. Even though doctors do not exactly understand why this procedure works, it still provides hope that maybe they are getting closer to finding out more about the brain of those with depression than we already know. I feel like this procedure may be a luxury only so many people can afford to take a risk on if they are selling it. It is important researchers look into inexpensive treatments for depression as well to help those of different socioeconomic class as well."
2008,"The most appropriate role for state hospitals to have in regards to the criminal justice system is to take in patients with critical mental health issues that otherwise would be sent to a normal prison or jail. Those with mental illness would not receive the appropriate treatment in a prison or jail that they would within a mental health state hospital. These hospitals have staff that have training in handling those with mental illness and are there to treat the mentally ill, whereas jails and prisons are used as punishment. State hospitals, while not being prison, still strictly monitor their patients so it is not a way to simply get out of jail. The people who state hospitals take in from a correctional setting need to be those who are in dire need of rehabilitation. Those who would absolutely become worse in prison or jail in regards to their symptoms deserve a chance to get back on the right track and to take control of their lives. In the way that those in prison or jail can get their GED’s to better their futures, those with mental illness need to be able to better their future as well and this can be done through treatments such as medication and specialized therapy. Unfortunately, jails and prisons do not offer extensive inpatient care, so it is important that those who are mentally ill have a place to obtain the help they need. State hospitals should not be used exclusively for forensic patients. Those who are mentally ill need specialized care that a state hospital can provide. While going to a general hospital could give some people some help, it is not rehabilitation. Many of those placed on mental health holds do not even leave the emergency room area. There needs to be a specialized place where they can get the help that they need and where there are specialists knowledgeable in their mental illness. There are other populations that need mental health help, such as veterans and the homeless. These state hospitals would allow them to obtain the help that they needed. However, safety is always a concern when dealing with people who are potentially violent. In this regard, those who are forensic patients need to be separated from the general population of the state hospital. Perhaps this can be done through specialized floor access or having a separate wing from the forensic patients, but it is important that safety is taken into account to ensure the maximum rehabilitation for the mentally ill and for the safety of the staff."
2009,"Gabriela, Great post! I definitely agree that those who are mentally ill need to be placed into state hospitals in order to be rehabilitated. This is crucial because prisons and jails do not offer specialized treatment programs for those who have mental illness. In addition to this, training on handling those with mental illness is often optional for those who work in the criminal justice system. It is important that those who have specialized training in working with those who have mental illness are working with persons with mental illness. State hospitals are potentially crucial because rehabilitation can reduce the recidivism rate for those with mental illness. I also agree that state hospitals should work with forensic and non-forensic populations as there are still populations who have not committed a crime that need mental health care."
2010,"Hey Sayla, I always considered those who have mental illness going to one or the other: state hospital or prison. Suggesting that they go to the state hospital and then to the criminal justice system is a new idea to me and I am curious how it would work. Would the time spent in the state hospital count towards the crime they have committed? I think it is a very interesting idea since those who are mentally ill do need help but they have also committed a crime. To me, it should be the state hospital only as the environments in jails and prisons can have detrimental effects on those with mental illness. To go and receive treatment at a state hospital and then be placed into the criminal justice system could un-do all of the progress someone with mental illness has made while in the hospital. There would need to be some form of therapy that prepared them to be in the prison environment if they were going to go to both. Great job!"
2011,"The data sharing seems satisfactory, however, when sharing the ""minimum"" information that is needed to treat the person with mental illness, how does one judge what minimal information is enough? Mental illness is complex with various symptoms and various ways a person handles their own mental illness. Sharing minimal information may only scratch the surface of the conflict that a person with mental illness is dealing with in regards to their condition. There needs to be a standardization of the information shared. It needs to be thorough yet still respectful of the patient's privacy. This is a fine line that professionals will have to be careful not to cross, but I think standardizing how the information is shared will improve the understanding of the criminal justice system."
2012,"The CIT trained approach seemed a lot more personable than a routine law enforcement encounter. They seemed to be calm yet urgent in their care of the man who was feeling upset and took multiple pills. They stressed that they wanted what was best for him wanted to get him help. They were also vigilant in their actions. One of the officers saw the pills on the counter and swiftly pulled them away from the man while he was talking to the other officer so he would not be able to consume any more of the pills. In addition to this, there were more actors in the process. They had someone specifically there to talk to the girlfriend who may have been feeling trauma from the situation. Officers had all their bases covered and it seemed like they were really wanting what was best for the man."
2013,"I think it is because those who are in police custody are thought to be second-class citizens to be frank. Their mental health and overall health is not taken as seriously as it should be because these are thought to be people who are disposable within society that messed up and deserve what has happened to them. Once the public gets wind and people begin to realize the unsettling reality, there is a pressure to change in order to alleviate the public's scrutiny. Whether it be out a genuine desire to change and a realization of their mistakes or just to get the public off of their back's is really only known to the departments."
2014,The people that mental health workers are handling in a corrections environment are those who have maybe never dealt with the issue of their own mental health so they are basically starting from the bottom and working their way up in regards to treatment. Not all inmates are going to respond to the same treatment so it is going to take time to figure out the best treatment method for each inmate. I think cross-training would help because it builds the understanding that correctional agencies and staff have for those with mental illness. They would be able to see which inmates have symptoms of mental illness and which ones are in need of more intense mental care than others. 
2015,"It is essential that all actors in the criminal justice actors to have training in mental health awareness due to the high volume of those with mental illness coming into contact with members of the criminal justice system. I do not think there is one essential training that benefits more than the others because there needs to be more data collected on each of the training methods in order to see which benefits those with mental illness as well as criminal justice officers the most. In the article by Parker (2006), the amount of force used by officers when dealing with those with mental illness was in a significant decline after their training. However, it is important that the training used in the article is tested on multiple different officers in multiple jurisdictions in order to see how beneficial it is for a variety of situations. I think the identification of mental illness is a significantly important factor that must be trained to correctional officers of all stages of experience. To be able to identify possibly mental illness indicators means early intervention. By intervening early into one’s incarceration, this can reduce the harm an inmate with mental illness inflects on themselves or others because they will be given proper medical care through, for example, medication. Recognizing the symptoms of something such as suicidal ideation can prevent inmate deaths as well as officers can proceed to intervene and prevent unnecessary inmate fatalities. In regards to those in the mental health field, it is imperative that they understand the resources to behavioral health that inmates have when incarcerated. With this knowledge, mental health providers can determine what the inmates need that they may not have had access to while incarcerated. For example, if inmates do not have access to group therapy sessions, this could be something mental health providers can try in order to help someone who is mentally ill that has been to jail or prison. I think knowing police protocols for use of force could also be something that could benefit mental health providers. By knowing why and when police use force, they can educate those with mental illness on this. Through this education, those with mental illness will know how to better respond in a situation that police are involved in. This can reduce the amount of harm that is caused to those with mental illness. By responding appropriately, those with mental illness can reduce the stigma that police"
2016,"Great post, Briana! It is interesting to know that the only way persons with mental illness are referred to treatment is only if they are placed on a 5150 hold. Despite not being a danger to themselves or others at the time being, those with mental illness still need help because they eventually very well may be in a position where they cause themselves harm. I think CIT training is a fantastic start and should be implemented nationwide, however, I think there is a continued need for study and research on the officers who have CIT training to make sure it is what is best in all situations and in all jurisdictions. There are many facets to mental illness that need to be understood by those in law enforcement, so perhaps deeper training needs to be done so officers have a broader understanding of those with mental illness. "
2017,"Hi Liisa, Great post! I think there needs to be various training methods so the best possible outcome when dealing with those with mental illness occurs. There are various facets of mental illness that those who are law enforcement need to understand in order to grasp the variety of symptoms and mental illnesses that affect people. While CIT is the main method of training that seems to be very popular among the cohort, I think it is important that more research is done on this training model in order to see how it works in various jurisdictions. I also think that those who are in the mental health field need an understanding of how law enforcement handles those with mental illness so they are prepared to handle cases of different variety. Situations in which those with mental illness interact with law enforcement can have various outcomes and it is important that those in the mental health field understand those outcomes so they can effectively treat patients. "
2018,"The diversion efforts focus on non-violent offenders because non-violent offenders do not have a direct victim as violent offenders do. Violent offenders are continuing to be punished by not being included in a rehabilitation program. However, I do think that those who are violent offenders should receive some form of rehabilitative care. In order to prevent them from acting in future violent crimes, it is imperative that they are given tools in order to help them cope, or job training so they do not have to turn to illegal acts for money. I think everyone should have the opportunity to turn their life around and in order to do that, they need the proper resources. "
2019,"I believe that mental health agencies are more willing to change to evidence-based practices because they would be more inclined to follow a practice that is supported by some proof whereas criminal justice is more inclined to follow what has worked in the past. It can be hard to implement change in the criminal justice system because many of its actors have been doing things a certain way for so long that they fail to be open to change. Mental health is something that is directly relating to research, so those who are in the mental health field understand that as time goes on, new practices will be discovered and supported that work better than the old ones. I feel there is more willingness to change on the mental health agency side."
2020,"An integrated model as described in the video could greatly reduce interactions between persons with co-occurring disorders and the criminal justice system. When they are treating the mental illness, they are also treating their dependencies on various substances that they may have used because they believed it helped their mental illness or because their mental illness had an influence on them using substances. They are essentially covering most, if not all, of their bases by treating their co-occurring disorders at the same time. By helping them to recover from both disorders, they are more likely to continue on the right path, to continue to rehabilitate themselves. Their mental illness won't cause them to go back to substances, and substances won't cause them to discontinue treatment or aggravate their mental illness symptoms. "
2021,"Peer mentoring can be essential in addressing stigma of mental illness. These peers are able to show those who are suffering that they can and will live normal lives with their mental illness. Having a mental illness does not mean they are going to be violent or lead unproductive lives so it is important that these peers show those with mental illness that it is not the end. A lot of people consider mental illness as a restriction for the rest of their lives. While it is something they will have to monitor, it is not something that will ruin their ability to thrive. By having a peer mentor who is thriving despite having a mental illness inspires hope and shows those who also have mental illness that they should stay positive."
2022,"The implementation of the recommendations could have several beneficial outcomes in regards to the outcomes of the mentally ill in the criminal justice system. It would benefit the communication between those who are mentally ill and the providers of medical treatment who work in the CJ system. This means that patients would be more open with their medical providers, reporting more symptoms of their mental illness and even side effects of their medication. Providers would be able to better treat those with mental illness in the criminal justice system because they would have more knowledge into what is specifically affecting the inmate/patient. Proper identification would lead to better treatment of the mental illness the inmate is experiencing. Once the inmate is receiving proper medical care, they would see the benefits of getting mental health help. After their release, the inmate may feel the need to follow up with their mental health treatment, thus reducing the overall recidivism rate. The onsite behavioral health technicians could identify mental illness in inmates early on, providing them with immediate treatment and care. This could lead to a better adjustment to the jail or prison environment, reducing the exacerbation of their mental illness symptoms. With the off-site psychiatrists for more in-depth cases, those with even severe mental illness (SMI) could receive the help they need. And, as stated in the article, people with SMI have shorter lifespans and substance abuse so treating SMI could be critical in their recovery. Once they are receiving proper medical care, those with SMI would show vast improvement and may continue treatment upon release. As stated previously, this could reduce the rate of recidivism in the population of persons with serious mental illness. Training should also be implemented for those who work in the criminal justice system. While the article mentions training in order to reduce behavioral health care shortages, I believe that training should be implemented in correctional settings in order to identify and help those with mental illness. By having appropriate training, correctional officers will know how to handle a situation with a person with mental illness. In addition to this, training could allow correctional officers to identify mental illness symptoms in inmates that were not detected by the medical personnel upon intake screening. This could lead to treatment for those with mental illness at any stage of"
2023,"Great post, Stephanie! I too mentioned the training of correctional staff because I think it is a large issue that needs to be addressed. Throughout their incarceration, those with mental illness may begin to show more noticeable symptoms and it is important that correctional officers are able to see these symptoms and intervene. Early intervention could lead to more possible outcomes for inmates as they continue their time in prison or jail, but also when they are released. Getting the proper mental health care could reduce recidivism in populations with mental illness and possibly reduce their rate of substance abuse, as persons with serious mental illness sometimes use substances to cope. Training correctional officers could also lead to better preparedness for handling situations in which those with mental illness are unruly. This would lead to safer environments for other inmates, staff, and the mentally ill overall. "
2024,"Great points, Briana! I did not think about comorbid illnesses initially however you are absolutely right. Those with serious mental illness often have issues with substance abuse as well, so identifying both of those could lead to better outcomes for those with mental illness. They would not be dependent on substances to control their symptoms as they would have medication, but they would also receive care for their addictions at the same time. This would lead to more positive outcomes upon release from the jail or prison that they are currently in. Treatment of mental illness would reduce recidivism rates, so it is imperative that treatment plans are implemented in order to make sure the cycle of the criminal justice system can be broken. "
2025,"   Based on the 60 Minutes video, what could have prevented Timothy Souders from dying in prison? I think for starters, Timothy did not need to be in prison. He should have received the mental help that he needed. The restraints in prison also made his condition much worse. Timothy tried to harm himself and still did not receive the proper care."
2026,How have non-medical considerations driven provision of treatment and care for persons with mental illness? Through history society treated mental illness religiously or with fear. People with mental illness were thought to be monsters and needed to be purged. This lea to treating them with isolation or just unnecessary methods to expel the disease from them.
2027,"In terms of reducing gun violence, do you think the benefits of a national registry of mentally ill persons outweigh the costs? Please explain why or why not. I feel like a registry would just add to the stigma that exists with mental illness. Like stated in the first video, people with mental illness are not among the most violent people. The most violent crimes are not committed by mentally ill people, so if we were to put all mentally ill people on a registry there is a high probability that it will not make much of a difference."
2028," Given the challenges PWMI have faced as a result of deinstitutionalization, what do you think is the most important problem to “fix” and why? The biggest problem to fix would be getting mentally ill people out of jails. They cannot receive the help they really need in the justice system. Also, sending mentally ill people to jails, they are criminalizing the fact of having a mental illness. People with mental illness are thought to be criminals already because of something they cannot control, trying to change this would be the start of fixing this problem."
2029," Through history, society has tried to plant some type of fear of the mentally ill in people. People with mental illness were somehow exiled from society. They were put in isolation of were just pushed away by the people around them. Different “cures” were practiced, such as opening a hole in the skull to “let out the bad spirits”. People with mental illnesses were thought to have bad spirits, demons, or monsters in them. Mental illness is barely getting the awareness that could start a much needed conversation, but society still has not decided that it is time to give mentally ill people the treatment they really need."
2030,"Hi Bethannie I agree with you. It takes a lot of time to educate society. The biggest issues would be the misinformation that is out there. For example, this week we saw that people fea mentally ill people because they are thought to be violent. In reality they are not, but due to that misguided idea, individuals decide to keep mentally ill people away from society. "
2031,"Hi Cornise, You made a good point when you brought back the idea from an earlier discussion. Women were thought to be mentally ill just because they were not behaving like society thought a woman should behave. Mental illness has always been associated with the word ""crazy"". Basically, if someone does something that does seem right to another group of people, the perosn is considered to be messed up in the head or just plain insane. There could be many things happening in today's society where society is easily exiling others simply because of their different way of behaving. "
2032,"In order to end the stigma of metal illness would be to show the public that it is something that is extremely common. This should be seen as any other visit to the doctor’s office. There isn’t always a lot of funding for mental health centers and they often get shut down. If there are a lot of mental health centers everywhere, there would not be seen as such a weird thing. The mental health centers would need to be placed in different communities regardless of socioeconomic status."
2033,"By reducing benefits for mental health care policymakers are showing that they do not see a need in mental health care. Medication is given for many illnesses, but when it comes to mental illnesses medication is not given so easily. If people with mental illness are being treated like they are not in need of medical assistance, they will not be treated. Overall mental illness would need to be recognized as any other illness."
2034,"Active military should have therapy or mental health professionals on their base where they can receive mental help anytime they may need it. Like stated in the video, veterans need to meet up in support groups where they can speak about their experiences with other veterans. Along with a support group, veterans would need to have psychiatric help provided to them. A multiple choice worksheet is probably not the best way to examine someone because these individuals need to be examined in depth and mental health professionals should not assume the same treatment for all of them."
2035,People with mental illness don’t acknowledge their illness because they are afraid of the way people would react. Treatment should be mandated if there is a risk associated with said illness. The priority would be to change the stigma of mental illness that is causing people to hide or deny their illness.
2036,"Mental illness has always come with a lot of stigma because of the way society has perceived it. It would help if children knew about mental illness from a very young age. Teaching children the commonality of mental illness, the implications of mental illness, and overall the idea that this isn’t something to push away. Once students begin to grow up, the conversation of mental illness can become more detailed and students can know exactly how to search for the help. Children experience many issues when they are growing up and most of these issues take place inside of schools. If students are taught about mental illness, symptoms, treatments, and acceptance of the illness at a young age, there can be newer generations that eliminate the stigma that comes with having a mental illness. Removing the stigma seems to be the priority when treatment options and access to treatment comes into question, which is why educating from the start could be the main solution."
2037,"Hi Amber,  I agree with you point about putting it in the school curriculum. Students have to take health classes such as sexual education, but there arent classes that address topic that involve something so stigmatizing like mental illness. You mentioned suicide as well, many kids have been bullied at school and unfortunately they have committed suicide. Courses like these in school can definately change things early on. "
2038,"Hi Tamara, You made a lot of great points in this post. You mentioned the stigma from ourselves and the stigma from society. I think that the self stigma is actually something even more difficult to express because of how society has had such a huge responsibility is pushing that stigma to people with mental illness. The self stigma is caused out of lack of trust to acknowledge or openly speak about their illness. They are afraid to because part of the ""them"" that is being exiled of society. "
2039,"With having seen the video of false positives and false negatives it seems like there is lot to be concerned about in terms of being able to make decision about civil commitment. With the possibilities of getting a false positive of false negative being higher there are a lot of risks of making the wrong decision. Due to the inaccuracy of tests, many people can be committed when they don’t need to be or other will not be committed when they actually do need to be committed."
2040,"Like stated in the first lecture, human behavior is near impossible to predict with a complete certainty. In the video, the man that was considered SVP when he committed a crime at the age of 16. If someone already paid for their crime, I think they should not be made to be put in another facility. There could be individuals that have shown to be violent while in prison, if that is the case then there would be justification to keep them in prison longer. The purpose of going to prison would be to pay the price of the crime."
2041,"Inpatient and outpatient commitment does restrict an individual’s liberty. Inpatient commitment is basically locking someone in a room because of the fear that they will do something to themselves or the people around them and that doesn’t sound much different than putting someone in prison. Of course, there are people that need to be institutionalized, but the options that are presented right now, are forceful and could still stigmatize mentally ill individuals. Outpatient treatment still has a lot of restrictions even if the person is not locked up. Both treatments don’t really help and individual feel much better about themselves because they are being forced into this solution."
2042,The pros of inpatient and outpatient involuntary treatment would be that it is able to give help to those that perhaps have not decided to look for help or are not capable of deciding for themselves. This is the solution that basically helps those because it would be worth it in the end but can be seen as too much of a push for the individuals. The cons would be that this takes away the ability for the individual to choose. This is viewed as unconstitutional and creates a lot of controversy because people are being forced to receive treatment that they do not seek or cannot consent to. Involuntarily committing people should only be done in cases where the individual clearly needs to be committed. If there is a clear indicator that proves this person is a danger to themselves or society then they should be committed. If there is no urgent issue then there would need to be another form of treatment.
2043,"Hi Denise, This discussion was difficult for me to forms two sides of this because I felt that people shouldn't be obligated to do something, but at the same time I began to think that the individuals desperately needed the help. I came to the same conclusion that you did as well. If the individuals do not pose an initial threat, they shouldn't be forced into an institution. Because they are being forced take this treatment, society just sees them as people that are out of control. "
2044,"Hi Nicolle, Interesting post. You mentioned that the patient might be more willing to take part in outpatient treatment if they had a say in how they could proceed with their treatment. I agree with this completely. If individuals are being forced into this situation, then I think they should be able to have an open conversation about their treatment. Perhaps that could be a better approach to making sure the patient receives the treatment that is necessary."
2045,"Probably the adjudication portion of the criminal process would be the most difficult because that is where there could be a trial for the individual or where they could plead guilty. If the individual wants to plead guilty, they would need to fully understand what exactly they are getting themselves into. Many people that come in contact with the law are not able to fully grasp knowledge of their rights and make wrong decisions. If there is an impairment, such as a mental illness, this can affect this person’s decision and understanding of what will happen during a trial. Another possibility would be confessing to something they did not do."
2046,"The challenges that would arise with the recent changes would be that people with mental illnesses may not be able to receive the help they are looking for. Many individuals preferred going to prison because they were able to receive the treatment they needed. Because many mental health centers have been shut down, prisons seemed like next best thing for PWMI. The issue with this would be that people with mental illness would still be put in a county jail when actually PWMI should not be incarcerated at all. The benefits would be the fact that they are being placed in local county jails instead of sate prisons."
2047,"I don’t think its fair for police to serve as first responders when there are situations involving people with mental illness because they aren’t specifically trained to deal with the situation. For example, the video mentioned the case of the woman’s mother that was killed when she was going to charge police officers with a knife. That is the way officers are trained to deal with these situations, but this shouldn’t be the way to act when confronting a person with mental illness. If police officers serve as first responders then they should have negotiators or someone that can assist in these type of situations."
2048,"CIT and stigma are related because CIT helps reduce the stigma of mental illness. Many are under the impression that people with mental illness are violent but because the CIT has been trained to deescalate any situation where there is a person with mental illness involved, this can prove that violence doesn’t have to be involved with people when it comes to mental illness. Due to the way crisis intervention teams handle these situation, society will be able to see that dealing with mentally ill people can be seen done without having to be panicked all the time."
2049,"The Taheri findings reported that CIT programs did not significantly reduce the arrests of people with mental illness. If CIT has not shown to be very effective at the moment perhaps there would need to be more of a community inclusion. According to our text, are not advocating for such programs to be taking place in their community. This could cause mental illness to be criminalized because amongst the community and CIT programs will continue to resort to imprisoning people with mental illness. Much like police officers are being educated on this matter, the community would need to be educated on this as well. This can be done though education in schools. Another solution would be to consider the training that is taking place for police officers. Although they are already receiving the training for these situations, perhaps there could be another way that would be effective. In the video lectures we saw that in one precinct officers were practicing de-escalation techniques with actors. If this became a nationwide method of training for officers, there can be a different empathetic approach to CIT."
2050,"Hi Lisa, Really interesting post. You mentioned that CIT officers responded with less force when compared to non-CIT officers. This really just goes back to the fact that although there has been no significant progress so far, this is a system that would take time. In order to educate or reset a certain mindset, more time would need to be invested and then there can be a clear change that becomes visible in the use of CIT."
2051,"Hi Gabriela,  Its great that you asked someone about this topic. This shows that CIT training is not emphasized everywhere. The videos we watched showed that officers from one city used them but after reading your cousin's experience, there is clearly not a full use of CIT everywhere. You make a good point about training dispatchers. In fact, I think all individuals that respond to possible CIT calls should be trained to address these cases. If all that attend these calls were to be trained in CIT, there would be more a consensus on how these situations should be deescalated. "
2052,If a person with mental illness to be arrested and jailed more than 100 times they begin to feel worse about their mental illness. PWMI already feel misunderstood and ashamed due to their illness and putting them in jail begins to criminalize them. Locking someone in a room or isolating them from everyone else does not help an individual with mental illness. Being incarcerated because of a mental illness can cause someone to avoid seeking treatment and decide to isolate themselves from society because they do not trust that they can be taken care of.
2053,"  In the first video, the social worker in the prison found about 15 people that had severe mental illness that were barely coming into the prison.  This factor becomes important because this shows that even if the jails do realize that the individual is mentally ill, they are not concerned about keeping them in jails instead of somewhere their illness can be addressed.  Inmates are given a pack of pills when they leave and never checked up on.  The treatment given is kind of like a one size fits all. They are just given pills as if that would solve their problem, but there is no one to check up on them again. Being in jail didn’t help at all and its possible that they left with a worse problem.  The constant return of mentally ill people to jail.  This is a clear indicatsor that nothing is being done to stop PWMI from entering the criminal justice system. The number is growing and people with mental illness in prison is a very common thing."
2054,"Overall, I think they are given the right amount of rights. I think there could be small adjustments made to make sure that inmates aren’t completely restricted of their basic rights. One of the questions for free speech were “How does the issue impact other prisoners, prison guards or official and prison resources?” This question sounds like something that the jail finds to be in their best interests. It can be understood how an inmate expressing themselves can affect other inmates, but it if the free speech affects the prison guards or officials shouldn’t be the number one priority. Maybe looking into the small details or conditions for all of the inmates’ rights could prompt adjustments."
2055,"Even if medications are more expensive, they are the least time consuming when it comes to treatment. Because many jails lack the staff to follow the steps of screening, using other methods of treatment is not an option for them because they have other inmates to deal with and cannot spend a lot of time with each one. There can be many forms of treatment, but there has to be the interest to take the time with each inmate and figure out what form of treatment would be best for them."
2056,"The use of jails for the seriously mentally ill is inappropriate due to the lack of attention, space, and prison staff. There is clearly enough funding to spend on medications, which are more expensive when compared to other approaches, but it is not being used on the inmate because of the lack of prison staff that can accommodate the inmates with mental illness. In terms of the Realignment policy, the mentally ill inmates will probably be affected if they were counting on being treated inside the jail system. Although the treatment in jails is not ideal, there was at least somewhere they were being accounted for. This policy can take the little help that was given to PWMI not receiving any help at all."
2057,"Hi Lisa,  The Realignment policy made me think that perhaps those that were mentally ill would not receive a lot of help because they were not going to be considered as dangerous as the other felony inmates that are coming to the jails. Overcrowding is something I didn't think about, but definitely can create a greater problem. PWMI are now going to feel overwhelmed with the amount of people that could be around them. The attention they were receiving is now going to be significantly cut due to the attention that has to be given to the incoming inmates. "
2058,"Hi Georgie, When it comes to architectual appropriateness, the lecture pointed out that jails used isolation as a solution. This is another example that proves the lack of resources there are in jails. These conditions are detrimental to inmates without mental illnesses, the consequences for individuals with mental illness would obviously be worse. "
2059,"If risk assessment tools are going to be used, there would need to be some conditions about when the risk assessment should be trusted. A lot of times it is not obvious that the individual will be a risk and there will probably not be a hundred percent chance that the individual is a risk, but if the probability is higher than the average person, then I think risk assessment tools should be used. Overall, human behavior is unpredictable and can never be guessed with complete certainty. If the individual is in jail and has shown improvement during their sentence, then I don’t think risk assessment tools would be necessary. I think risk assessment tools should be used only if the risk questionable."
2060,"Mental health professionals would probably support the RNR approach because its purpose to ultimately get mentally ill people out of prisons and jails. Mental heath professionals would want to make sure that people with mental illness can be integrated into society. In order to do so, there would need to be some proof that symptoms have reduced and that they have improved their functioning. If the symptoms have not reduced the person with mental illness could go ack into the justice system and continue this ongoing cycle."
2061,"The conditions of probation include treatment, reporting to officer, community service, etc. This can benefit a person with mental illness because they are under supervision. They will receive drug counseling and education in order to get and keep a job. They individual would have to report to a probation officer to show that they are staying employed and that would be able to keep them on track. Community service would be a good way to show that the individual is able to integrate themselves into the community. Probation is a much better option when compared to jail because the individual can better themselves and would not have to be locked in a cell for many years. In jail, conditions for a person with mental illness can worsen because of the high stress environment they are confined in. With probation, a person is able to be employed, and have a completely different lifestyle that would help their mental illness."
2062,"The mental health court is a good alternative because it keeps people with mental illness out of prison and understand that difference between PWMI and other offenders. The issue with mental health court is how stigmatizing it is. The way it is seen by people outside of the situation is that PWMI need their separate court because they should not be treated like other people. I would definitely feel a bit uncomfortable if I was a participant of the mental health court, but I wouldn’t prefer a traditional court proceeding because I would be given the help I need and not put in jail."
2063,"The guidance I would give a Chief Probation Officer when using RNR principles they would have to be aware of how much data they actually have. Skeem et al. (2015), mentioned that RNR could be extremely useful, but there is not a lot of empirical data to back it up. When identifying risk, there would need to be enough data or evidence collected to show that the individual in question is a risk to society and should not be let out on probation. There cannot be an exact list of steps to follow because this would need to be taken on as a case by case basis. Each individual being evaluated would be different and would need to be evaluated differently. For example, Skeem et al. (2015) also pointed out that some studies showed that cognitive-behavior programs worked better in targeting certain risk factors that psychiatric treatment didn’t. Once again, not all methods will work for each person. The caution that needs to be taken would be to find the specific solution that will work for each person and not a one size fits all approach."
2064,"Hi Denise, I agree with your perspective. Often times, the view of helping with people with mental illness ends up only focusing on what is better for society and not PWMI. RNR tends to focus on what would be in the best interest of society, but it does not really have an in depth approach to address all risk factors that can arise from an individual. On person can have completely different risk factors from the next which would mean that they cannot have the same treatment plan. Like you mentioned, the treatment on PWMI would need to be individualized."
2065,"Hi Natalie, I like your approach. Cognitive behavioral therapy seems like it can be an approach that can be fixed to each individual. This type of therapy can used to address all identified risk factors PWMI may present. RNR seems like the start of treatment, but involving the detailed therapy that is needed will be an extra asset that can be beneficial to PWMI."
2066,Prison environments can make a person’s mental illness worse. The video described scenarios where jail conducted cell extractions because they didn’t know if the inmate was going to react aggressively or not. They would strip the inmate of their clothes and drag him out of his cell. Other inmates have witnessed inmates in isolation chew on their flesh to get the attention of the guards. Being isolated for so long caused an inmate to hurt themselves just so that they would be able to get out of the small room they were in. The conditions in prison can clearly aggravate the condition of a person with mental illness. The instinct to survive is the only thing that the inmates are thinking about in order to get out of isolation.
2067,"I think it is possible to truly rehabilitate prisoners with mental illness because the main issue is that people with mental illness should not be in prison. Being in prison has shown to worsen the conditions of people with mental illness, so if someone is not truly rehabilitated being incarcerated could be the reason."
2068,"Keeping inmates in solitary confinement allows guards to be in control of their environment, but the fact that someone can go insane for being locked in a closed room doesn’t help the guards of the inmates. If an inmate has been in solitary confinement for a while, they do not know how to behave when they are obligated to go back into the general population of the prison. This can cause more fights and less order in the prisons."
2069,"Tax dollars are already paying for jails, so I don’t think it’s a bad idea that our tax dollars get used for mentally ill people in prisons. The issue with this would be that there isn’t a lot being done for PWMI in prisons. If tax dollars are not enough, the state should budget out more funds to actually help the mentally ill inmates."
2070,"According to the lectures, it costs about $75,000 annually per inmate, but if the inmate in mentally ill, the cost of keeping that inmate incarcerated costs much more. Keeping people out of prison when they don’t need to be incarcerated would automatically cut costs. The video in the lectures also showed a program where inmates learned how to make a living when they left the prison. Results of that program showed about 40 individuals graduated and none of them returned to prison. Also, if the state decides to provide funding for mental health services there could be enough mental health professionals that could provide treatment to PWMI in prison. Medication is also more expensive when compared to other treatments. Medication is used as the easy solution when treating PWMI. Changing the way inmates are treated could put those funds to a cheaper ad beneficial use. For example, officers can we trained on how to better deal with the inmates with mental illness. Resources should be available to those that need it, but if someone is suffering from severe mental illness, they should receive more resources. Those that need the most help should be thought of as the urgent case."
2071,"Hi Serenity, I agree with you, having a block specially for people with mental illness could be helpful. There would not be the worry of general population affecting the inmates with mental illness. Officers would immediatelty know when they are dealing with an inmate with mental illness. Officers who are trained to deal with these sitautions could just be in charge of that block. This is make a lot of sense and en easier alternative when trying to cut costs to assist PWMI."
2072,"Hi Lisa, PWMI should receive more resources that those that don't have mental illness because mental health centers are being shut down. The urgent matters should be attended to first and in this case, PWMI would be the priority. Keeping people in prisons is the reason why so much money is being spent, if we take the people out of prisons by addressing their mental health issues, cutting costs will no longer be an issue. "
2073,"Bettering the way PWMI receive treatment requires the assistance of many. If I was a taxpayer in Missouri, I wouldn’t mind my tax dollars going to the Fulton State Hospital. Like the lecture stated, many state hospitals have staffing shortages and the funding from states is inadequate. If taxpayers contribute, the state hospital can have better treatment options for PWMI. The hospital will not be able to be as great or state of the art as it supposed to be if there is no funding for it."
2074,"I think NGRI is a tactic that is used by people who are actually mentally stable because they think it will get them out of jail. Those do suffer of some mental illness should use this defense, but according to the lecture, only one percent of case involve an insanity plead and less than half are actually successful. This can make the not guilty by reason of insanity plea look like it’s a simple way of getting out of jail, but for those that actually fit the description could be seen as people that are trying to escape from paying for their crime."
2075,"I think state hospitals would need to focus on finding enough staff that is trained to deal with all the patients. Without the correct training the employees will not know how to deescalate certain situations and without the proper staffing the wrong people will be tasked with taking care of individuals they know nothing about. Also, if there was proper staffing there can be a control of drugs and other activities taking place in the hospitals."
2076,"When you listen to how it helped some people, including the woman that was being interviewed, it sounds like a procedure that everyone with severe depression should get. The issue is when the doctor says that she has no idea if what they are doing is the right thing or perhaps it could be the wrong thing. I think that with so much unpredictability, the procedure seems like it’s a matter of luck. Right not the people undergoing this treatment are just test subjects hoping to find a way out of their illness and wishing for it to work."
2077,"A strength of the qualitative approach would be that it’s a method of observation that doesn’t gather numerical data. This becomes a strength because it allows an explanation through social contexts in comparison to quantitative research that applies a more academic context to research. If a study like the one mentioned in lecture 8.1 is done where data is being acquired by people, the possible limitation would be that the data would be hard to replicate. I found the Haney article the most convincing because of the 125 interviews that were conducted with fathers that had been incarcerated. This allowed a better understanding of what a father would experience in while in jail or prison. Information about their roles as fathers, how they could possibly care for their children and the overall experiences they had in justice system."
2078,"Hi Lisa, Great post. I agree with your point about state hospitals being a great alternative to jail for mentally ill offenders. In the past modules the conversation has surrounded the idea that mentally ill individuals should not be incarcerated. If state hospitals are better able to take in PWMI involved in the criminal justice system, they will be able to fulfill the purpose that you are mentioning. Like you mentioned, state hospitals are better suited to handle the different cases of mental illness than a prison or jail. "
2079,"Hi Georgie, I agree with your point of not having any restrictions on the availability of state hospitals and the treatment they can provide. If PWMI are not restricted in their access to such facilities, there would not be a need to involve PWMI in the criminal justice system. State hospitals are much more qualified to deal with forensic patients and other individuals that may have had legal issues in the past. Instead of processing individual criminally, the individuals can be civilly committed without a criminal record. "
2080,"(Wrong post written above) State hospitals should continue to work with the criminal justice system because there needs to be mental health professionals involved with PWMI in the justice system. Much like the Fisher article explains, there are forensic patients, sexually dangerous persons, difficult to discharge patients and voluntarily committed individuals that are in need of the services and treatments provided to them in state hospitals. Because of this, I don’t think state hospitals should be exclusively for forensic patients but instead create different sections for different needs within the state hospitals. Those who are involved directly with the criminal justice system, for example those who are incompetent to stand trial, would be in one section or block of the hospital while perhaps those who voluntarily committed themselves would be placed somewhere else. State hospitals could also become much more involved with the criminal justice system by civilly committing forensic patients instead of processing them through the criminal court system."
2081,"The amount of information that the mental health system shares with the criminal justice system gives enough information to understand the individual, but not enough to affect the person in case of legal action. I think this does help understand the link between the criminal justice and mental health system because the mental health system shows preference to their clients and only gives the criminal justice system the information that is really needed."
2082,"The CIT trained approach involves a lot of conversation. The conversation is to get the individual calmed down in order to solve the issue. This isn’t an interrogation or accusation for a crime, police officers and paramedics take the time to understand how the individual feels so that they can take them somewhere that can assist them. A routine law enforcement encounter is always thought of as a situation where police officers show up and arrest those who have done something wrong and take them to jail. CIT approach just wants to make sure that the individual is in a calmed so that they don’t hurt themselves or other people."
2083,"After a court order or legal action, the individual’s mental illness is taken seriously. The stigma of mental illness involves the idea that the person is fine, and they are just faking to get out of the situation. Presenting a court order or taking other legal actions also could show severity. This person requires much more help than the average person and that is why legal action was necessary. The views clearly contribute more to the stigmatization of mental illness because PWMI are not being taken care of without having to take legal actions."
2084,The correctional environment is seen as an intimidating institution. Mental health workers are dealing with individuals that are vulnerable but also possibly defensive because of the situation they are in. Cross-training can get mental health workers and correctional agencies to be on the same page and keep the same goals in mind. The inmates are surrounded by correctional staff all day which is why it would be necessary to keep mental health professionals working closely with correctional staff.
2085,"Criminal justice actors work with mental health professionals, which would mean that they also would need to have an understand of people with mental illness and how to handle any situation with them. The essential training for both mental health and criminal justice actors would be to understand the signs and behaviors that come with mental illness. According to Watson and Fulambarker (2012), about 14 percent of males and about 30 percent of women in jails show serious mental illness. Individuals presenting serious mental illness were arrested because there wasn’t enough training to teach officers how to deescalate the situation. Training like the video shown in lecture 9-2 would be beneficial for mental health and criminal justice actors because it shows a walkthrough of how the issue should be identified and addressed. If training and education about the possible behaviors and symptoms of mental illness are taught, everyone involved would be able to differentiate between reckless behavior and mental illness. Officers have arrested many people with mental illness probably because they were not able to identify mental illness and decided to arrest the individual. Judges, prosecutors and district attorneys, and mental health professionals can be beneficial to PWMI if they receive training on this because solving this part of the problem will help dissolve the stigma of mental illness in the justice system and open up the conversation of mental health resources that can be provided by professionals. It can be as simple as showing the most common type of mental illnesses that are encountered, explaining the symptoms that can lead to specific behaviors, and using that knowledge to observe those that mental health and criminal justice actors encounter."
2086,"Hi Janee,  Very good explanation of CIT. I agree that CIT helps the mental health and criminal justice professionals come together to find a common solution. I also found the training video to be interesting because while one officer began to talk with the man about how he was feeling, the other officer took the bottle of pills away from him. Because CIT is not being used everywhere there isn't that much data to prove that it works as well as we may think, but if CIT begins to be used in more precincts there would be much more information that could prove that this mix or law enforcement and mental health practice can help deescalate many situation and divert PWMI away from the justice system. "
2087,"Hi Suzanna, I like how you divided the necessary education of both sides is interesting. In terms of the criminal justice system, I agree that there is not one essential training they should receive. Because mental health is not their area of expertise, I do believe that criminal justice actors should receive some training in everything that has to do with mental health awareness. it would be difficult to point out one factor that is most important of all because of the possible differences between encounters. As for mental health professionals I think you brought up a really good point. Often times the conditions or needs of PWMI in jail are known to be less than adequate, but mental health professionals should figure a way to make sure PWMI receive all the resources possible instead of handing them medications and hoping for the best. "
2088,"I think non-violent offenders are not taken into consideration because of the unpredictability that comes with violent offenders. Training has been focused on non-violent offenders and there are still some challenges when facing non-violent offenders. Violent offenders should receive the same resources offered to non-violent offenders. Different training should be provided so that diversion efforts can be targeted towards violent offenders and how to deescalate situations involving them. Attention to violent offenders would still be needed, but perhaps a much more intense intervention technique would be required."
2089,"Based on the 60 Minutes video, I think that several different factors would have prevented Timothy Souders from dying in prison. The first main factor I think would have prevented him from dying in prison is if he was not put in solitary. Souders was put in solitary because he broke a stool and used a sink to flood his cell. Though this can be seen as problematic behavior, Souders was not harming anyone and instead of being put in solitary, I think he should have received mental health services for his behavior. Instead, Souders was put in solitary and received constraints, which at times were removed upwards of every 17 hours. The constraints were problematic because they left Souders tied up like an animal and did not give him the ability to move around in his cell. These actions probably made Souders lose trust in the people around him because they were treating him so poorly, and might be why he decided not to drink water when he was offered water. Thus, I think that being placed in solitary and being in constraints could have prevented Souders' death.  A second main factor that would have prevented Souders from dying in prison was if there were more resources for the mentally ill in prison. For the case of Souders, there was no mental health staff that attended to Souders when he was put in solitary because the psychiatrist at the time was on leave. On top of that, a social worker that wanted Souders to transfer to a hospital never finished the paperwork. I think with more resources, a mental health specialist would have intervened before Souders got put into solitary confinement, since Souders had mentioned killing himself before being put in solitary. I think that the mental health intervention would have improved the well-being of Souders and would have not caused him to act out, which could have prevented his time in solitary and potentially saved his life. Aside from those two main factors, I think things like more training for guards and a less punitive criminal justice system could have also prevented Souders from dying in prison. More training for guards would have taught the guards to take some kind of action when Souders was refusing water. A less punitive criminal justice system would have realized that Souders needed help when he shoplifted, rather than locking him up for a non-violent crime and sending him to a prison not suited to meet his mental health needs.  Overall, I think that there are actions that could have be"
2090,"I think that the culture and policy during a time period are how non-medical considerations have driven the provision of treatment and care for individuals with mental illness. For example, in pre-civilization, individuals that threatened the well-being of a clan were seen as having abnormal behavior and were often banished from the clan. This example demonstrates how individuals did not look for symptoms regarding the mentally ill, and rather focused on whether an individual was threatening and if they were threatening, they would ask a family member to manage them and if that got out of hand, then they would banish them. Another example is asylums during the 19 th century, and how women for simply challenging social norms, like disagreeing with their husbands, were thrown into asylums. Once again, this is an example of how non-medical considerations, such as symptoms, were not taken into account and rather defying societal standards was an indicator if someone was mentally ill. In this example, individuals got a little bit more care and treatment than individuals during pre-civilization, evident in how the goal of asylums were to treat and care for individuals with mental illness. Public asylums were government funded and housed poor individuals and had poor conditions, while private asylums sometimes had even poorer conditions because lack of government oversight and sometimes were gentle retreats. Thus, in some asylums individuals with mental illness got proper care and in others they did not. Lastly, I think that hospitals being poor is another non-medical consideration that drove treatment and care among individuals with mental illness. Since hospitals in the 1900’s were in horrendous conditions and were impacted by the Not in My Back Yard (NUMBY) stance, this resulted in President Truman signing the National Mental Health Act, in hopes that this would lead to a cure for the mentally ill. This example demonstrates that hospitals being impacted caused policy to focus on the treatment and care of individuals with mental illness. Overall, non-medical considerations, like cultural norms and policy have driven the provision of treatment and care for persons with mental illness."
2091,"I do not think there are benefits of a national registry of mentally ill individuals. I think that the only benefit of a national registry is that there is a comprised localized list of all mentally ill persons, which researchers can use to reach out to people for research and clinical trial purposes. Other than that, I think the list does harm and that the harm outweighs the benefits. As we learned in lecture, people with mental illness account for small percentage of violence in our society and it is not realistic for someone to be fearful of someone with a mental illness. In fact, 3-5% of violent offenses are committed by someone mentally ill and we need to be more fearful of our neighbor drinking because alcohol abuse is one of the strongest risk factors for violence. Additionally, having a national list will make people ashamed for having a mental illness. This is problematic because the denial of a mental disorder is a significant barrier to getting care, and it is important to get care because the earlier the intervention, the better the outcome for the individual because they have a higher chance of receiving proper care. Thus, a list is not beneficial because it is not a way to identify dangerous people and we would never be able to do that without over-predicting. Also, as long as weapons are available, troubled people will get their hands on them. Rather, we should change the narrative of the media so that there is not a stigma of mental illness. Currently, the media focuses on banning weapons and keeping weapons out of the hands of the mentally ill when gun violence occurs. The media needs to shift topics since individuals with mental illness are not violent. Therefore, there is no evidence that mentally ill account for largely disproportionate amount of gun violence, and for that reason, we need to make sure that individuals with mental illnesses do not end up on a national list."
2092,"Deinstitutionalization was an effort to move mentally ill patients from hospitals to the community where they could receive community mental health services. Individuals with mental illness faced several challenges as a result of deinstitutionalization, including less access to medications, lack of a place to live, and encounters with the criminal justice system. Of all the challenges the individuals with mental illness faced and continue to face during deinstitutionalization, I think that the most important problem to fix is the criminalization of the mentally ill. Currently, police arrest individuals with mental illnesses at significantly higher rates than those without mental illness. One reason this happens is because police often resort to arresting mentally ill individuals in hopes that the criminal justice system will help with their mental health needs. Majority of these arrests happen for misdemeanor charges, and in fact, individuals with mental illness get arrested at higher rates than individuals without mental illness. I think this problem needs to be fixed because the criminal justice system is not ill-equipped to deal with individuals with mental illness because they lack resources, evident in how prisons often have lack of mental health staff, waitlists, and communications problems. This is problematic because individuals are not getting the care they need. A great example of this is Souders, who had suicidal thoughts and needed help, but because of the lack of mental health resources in the prison he was placed in, he did not get the help he needed. I think that a step towards the right direction would be integrating individuals with mental illness into our society, rather than isolating them, so that they can secure housing, find a job, and build relationships. This is important because the TED talk mentioned how individuals with mental illness are quite vulnerable and this often leads them to commit misdemeanors, and a result, they often end up in prison. Overall, I think that criminalization of the mentally ill is the most important challenge of deinstitutionalization that needs to be fixed. "
2093,"Hi Denise, I really like how you mentioned that Souders' would have benefited from a full medical and mental evaluation. In my own post, I mentioned that he would have benefited from mental health services, but did not think of the importance of a full evaluation, so I am glad you brought that up! I especially think that an evaluation would have been beneficial right when he entered the prison, especially since this week we learned about the importance of early intervention. "
2094,"Hi Eva, I really like how you brought up that Souders should have been placed in isolation for a limited amount of time. I am glad that you brought that up, because as you mentioned, there are detrimental effects that arise when an individual is put into isolation for a long period of time. I wonder what Souders thought of the isolation and if he felt his symptoms getting worse from being placed in isolation. I also wonder what his thoughts were when he saw a guard come to his cell when he was placed in isolation. I wonder if that made him happy because someone was finally engaging with him or if that made him scared and angry because the guards treated him like an animal, since they would tie him up for long periods of time. "
2095,"Hi Jennifer, I like how you brought up the importance of regular evaluations by a psychiatrist and physician. I think that often times individuals in the criminal justice system think that an evaluation by a mental health specialist is suffice to treat an individual with mental illness. However, as we have learned throughout our program, consistent treatment and care is important for long-term benefits. Having a mental health specialist meet with Souders once would have been putting a bandaid on the situation, rather he needed regular evaluations like you mentioned. "
2096,"Hi Asia, I like how you brought up the importance of religion being one of the main non-medical aspects that influenced the way individuals with mental illness were treated for and cared for. I think this is a really good point you brought up because as our book mentioned, religion and government during the Middle Ages were crucial to maintaining social order. In the process of maintaining social order during the Middle ages, religion and the government both made sure that individuals with mental illness were tortured and murdered. "
2097,"Hi Danielle, I like how you brought up Dorothea Dix and how she started a conversation that individuals with mental illness should be treated and cared for. I think that is an important thing that you brought up because that kind of conversation is what caused society to see individuals with mental illness as a population that could be treated for and cared for, rather than a problematic population that needed to be banned from society. "
2098,"Hi Lisa, Like you, I agree that having a national list would create more of a stigma regarding mental illness, especially if once an individual is on that list, they are on that list forever, even if they have received treatment and no longer have a diagnosis. I also like the point you brought up about spending our energy on educating people, rather than creating a list. I think education is very important so that we can change the narratives that the media puts out about individuals with mental illness, since right now the media tends to associate mental illness and violence a lot. "
2099,"Hi Steve, I like the examples you brought up in your post and I think you did a really good job at showing both ends of the spectrum when it comes to having a national registry for individuals with mental illness. I think a lot of times individuals associate gun violence with mass shootings, and we often forget that  gun violence is also associated with suicides and accidental deaths. One of the articles we were assigned this week talked about how 60% of deaths caused by firearms are suicides. I think this is important because when we think of gun violence, we need to not only think about individuals harming others, but individuals harming themselves. "
2100,"Hi Liisa, I like how you brought up how the lack of social support is one of the most important problems to fix. I think that this is an important point you brought up because I think it is one of the cheapest and fastest challenges to fix. One simple way to help solve this problem is to educate individuals on deinstitutionalization and how simple things, like creating relationships with individuals that are mentally ill or hiring individuals that are mentally ill, can help solve the problem. "
2101,"Hi Nicolle, Like McKenna, I think the point you brought up about homelessness is very important. Individuals that are homeless are probably more worried about food and shelter, rather than seeking community mental health services. I think that tackling homelessness by providing stable housing is a great first step because individuals with mental illness will start to feel secure and I think that is really important because then they can focus on other domains in their life, like their mental health or social relationships. "
2102,"Mental illness has been viewed in various ways throughout the centuries, and has often been dictated by the sociocultural and political forces of the time. These views often influence the public perception about self-determination of individuals with mental illness and their willingness to consider them full-fledged members of society. During pre-civilization, individuals with mental illness were managed by their family and those who could not be managed by their family were ultimately banned from their clan. Society did not want to deal with mentally ill individuals, evident in how it was acceptable to ban mentally ill individuals from clans. This kind of view suggests that individuals with a mental illness did not have much self-determination because they couldn’t make their own choices and rather their family unit made choices for them while managing them under their care.  Additionally, society did not think that individuals with mental illness were full-fledged members of society. There was some effort to heal them, as there has been evidence of trephination to expose the brain and release the spirits causing the abnormal behavior. However, ultimately rather than helping individuals with mental illness so that they can get well and contribute to society, it was seen that getting rid of them was much easier. When ancient civilization came around, we see the government becoming more involved in controlling individuals with mental illness. For example, a curator was often appointed to a person with mental illness (Slate, Buffington-Vollum, Johnson, 2013). Similar to pre-civilization, this suggests that society did not think that individuals with mental illness had autonomy to make decisions and that they were not seen as contributing members of society because someone had to take care of them.  Rejecting individuals with mental illness was a recurring theme throughout history. For example, in the middle ages, individuals with mental illness were tortured and murdered. This suggests that individuals with mental illness had lack of self-determination and were not considered members of society because they were either tortured or killed. There was a small shift of thinking during the renaissance and pre-civil war era. During these times, we see that individuals with mental illness were confined to hospitals and institutions. This demonstrates that there was an effort to help cure individuals with mental illness by putting them in confinem"
2103,"Hi Caroline, You bring up a really good point about mentally ill individuals that are violent. I think if the criminal justice system has taken their violent past into account and deems them fit to leave the criminal justice system, then I do think they should be reintegrated into society. If we do not accept them into our society, meaning if we do not help them secure housing and find jobs, I think that they would become isolated and this would exacerbate their symptoms and possibly their violent tendencies. I think in an ideal world, the government would regulate mentally ill individuals that are violent by mandating them to attend outpatient treatment. However, I have mixed feelings about this. On one end of the spectrum, I think by mandating them, we would take away their autonomy to make decisions on their own and their self-determination because they are forced to attend treatment. On the other side of the spectrum, I found a study that used intensive case management (a case manager helping a mentally ill individual manage the dangerous risks they face) to reduce violence in individuals with mental illness and the study found that intensive case management reduced an individual's dangerousness (Dvoskin & Steadman, 1994). Therefore, I do think that violent mentally ill individuals should not have restrictions if reintegrated, and on top of that, I think that it is important that they receive outpatient treatment to help manage their violent tendencies.   Dvoskin, J. A., & Steadman, H. J. (1994). Using intensive case management to reduce violence by mentally ill persons in the community.  Psychiatric Services, 45(7), 679-684."
2104,"Hi Eva, I like how you mentioned that overall, throughout centuries, it seems like society has never looked favorably upon mental illness and there is some sort of stigma attached to it. I agree with that point, and I think that is a great way to summarize the theme of perception of mental illness throughout the years. I feel like many individuals throughout the years have tried to reduce the stigma, however, they have not been successful. For example, in 1946, President Truman signed the National Mental Health Act, calling for a cure of mental illness. Though this act was passed with an effort to address mental illness, our book talks about how no actions were really taken until President Eisenhower became president and and formed the Joint Commision on Mental Illness and Health. Even then, this commision called for spending on mental health issues and did not do much other than that. It was not until President Kennedy took office where mental health issues were addressed in Congress. The reason I bring up the examples of these different presidents is because it seems like there was this acknowledgement that mental health was an issue, and it seems like the federal government was addressing it by passing acts and forming organizations. However, I think that the efforts were not really followed up with and not a main focus of the federal government, and for that reason mental health stigma remained in society.  Something I wanted to add is that The National Mental Health Act also created the National Institute of Health (NIH). I went on the NIH website and found this interesting timeline of important events that occured after Truman signed the act that I wanted to share (you can see the timeline at this website -  https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/nih-almanac/national-institute-mental-health-nimh).  I think that this timeline is interesting because it covers events that were not covered by our lectures and readings, like how in 1996 the NIH focused on childhood mental disorders and clinical neuroscience. "
2105,"Hi Danielle, I like the point you brought up about some disorders being normalized in our generation. I feel like that too, especially given the advent of social media. I also like how you brought up how mental illnesses are not all normalized, and I agree. I see people posting about depression and anxiety all the time on social media, but never about disorders like schizophrenia. I was wondering what the research says on this topic so I found an article talking about attitudes towards mental illness on social media. The study looked at over a million tweets and found that schizophrenia was the most stigmatized mental disorder (Robinson, Turk, Jilka, & Cella, 2019). I think this goes to show that mental disorders are disproportionately stigmatized. Tying this back to the discussion question, I think that this stigmatization suggests that even with the advent of social media, individuals still do not think that individuals with mental illness are full fledged members of society because of their negative perceptions of individuals with mental illness. This goes to show that even though throughout centuries the treatment and care of individuals with mental illness has changed, there has always been a stigma of individuals with mental illness, and even present day, that stigma still exists.  Robinson, P., Turk, D., Jilka, S., & Cella, M. (2019). Measuring attitudes towards mental health using social media: investigating stigma and trivialisation.  Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,  54(1), 51-58."
2106,"Hi Jennifer, I like how you said that earlier civilizations often dealt with mentally ill individuals with the mindset that they should be out of sight and out of mind. This kind of mindset would not accept individuals with mental illness as members of society, and as a result it would strip the self-determination of individuals with mental illness and did not give them opportunity to be full-fledged members of society. I feel like we still do that by criminalizing individuals with mental illness. By criminalizing them, we strip them away from their rights and put them in prisons that do not attend to their mental health needs. I feel like that when we criminalize individuals with mental illness, we are less scrutinized because nowadays it is a normative thing to do plus no one is dying. However, I think criminalizing them is problematic because there is not effort made to help them with their mental illness or help them become reintegrated into society. This just adds to the recurring theme that individuals with mental illness should be out of sight and out of mind. Also, I agree with the point you bring up about the data being there and that we should not be fearful of individuals with mental illness. I think that the first step of making other people realize this is changing the narrative of the media and their view of mental illness, so that the public stops stigmatizing individuals with mental illness. I think this first step would trigger a series of positive events, such as a decrease in the criminalization of individuals with mental illness and an increase in public perception that individuals with mental illness are full-fledged members of society. "
2107,"I think that one way a president can be effective in bringing about an end to stigma of mental illness is by making a speech, like Obama did. Obama’s speech shed light on how it is important to bring mental illness out of the shadows and how as a nation we have to support individuals with mental illness. Obama also brought up a good point about how we need to think of mental health like physical health, since the brain is a body part too, and how we know less about the brain compared to other body parts. I think his speech could have been stronger if he talked about a personal anecdote regarding mental illness or he talked about the story of a full-functioning adult with mental illness. I think an example would have demonstrated that people with mental illness aren’t as different as people think they are. The reason I think a speech is effective is because I think it is a simple and cheap way to combat stigma of mental illness because a speech starts a conversation about the topic of mental health. A speech can also can encourage individuals with mental illness to seek help and encourages individuals without mental illness to not isolate their peers with mental illness. I think a speech coming from a president is even more effective than a lay person giving a speech because a president is a person of power and a lot of individuals take the word of the president very seriously. Another way a president can be effective in bringing about an end to stigma of mental illness is allocating federal funding to community organization that focus on mental illness. With more money, community organizations can do more outreach to the public on the stigma of mental illness and how to combat the stigma, rather being short staffed and focusing on pressing issues, such as individuals with mental illness that need help right away. The president can also allocate funding to researchers so they can research cost effective ways to end wide spread stigma. Other than allocating funding, a president can also set up a task force or organization that solely focuses on combating the stigma of mental illness. Therefore, there are different ways a president can be effective in bringing about an end to the stigma of mental illness."
2108,"I think that the movement towards reducing benefits for mental health care says that policymaker’s value other health care significantly more than mental health. I think that policymakers know that there would be an uproar if there was a reduction in benefits for regular healthcare, especially since a lot of individuals live with chronic illness and depend on health care for getting the care they need. Thus, policymakers see mental health as an avenue to cut benefits and save money since they probably think that mental health is less prevalent. I don’t think that the prevalence of mental health should matter when it comes to benefits of mental health care, plus I think that the stigma of mental health is so strong that policymakers are unaware that so many individuals with mental illness hide their disease. Additionally, the media often portrays individuals with mental illness in a negative light (such as being violent) and so they are often seen as a burden to society.  This probably effects the view of policymakers because they see individuals with mental illness in a negative light, and this influences them to perceive mental health care less worthy, compared to other health care.  When it comes to the policymaker’s views, and their view on type of clients that need care, I think they think individuals with mental illness should not be prioritized. I think that policymakers take advantage of individuals with mental illness by cutting their benefit, knowing that there will not be that much backlash for cutting benefits for mental health care. As we learned a lot of times individuals with mental illness cannot stand up for themselves, which is why there would not be a lot of backlash for cutting benefits for mental health care. If there were cuts for regular healthcare, so many people would be outraged, especially since many individuals with chronic illness would have their day to day lives affected since they need constant care. Cutting mental health care would also effect the day to day lives of many individuals, but I do not think policymakers realize that. Another view policymakers might have is thinking that individuals with mental illness are at their own fault for their illness, and for that reason the healthcare system should not be picking up costs on their mental illness, and rather they should cover the costs. This is problematic because a lot of times individuals with mental illness do not have control over their symptoms, and need"
2109,"I think that the most important thing about mental health treatment for active military and veterans is early intervention. I think that mental health treatment should be provided as soon as possible and it should be a mandatory routine procedure that happens yearly. For example, I think a single session, per year, with a therapist should be mandatory for all active military. I know that this sounds a little extreme, but I think that if this is a routine process for everyone, there would be less stigma associated with mental illness. Plus, such process would help identify individuals that need continuous mental health treatment. When it comes to veterans, I think filling out a mandatory questionnaire the once every year for three years after they get discharged is another routine process that should be implemented. Once again, I know this is a little extreme, but this is a process that is not that time consuming compared to driving to a therapy session. The veteran in the video mentioned that it was a 30 question post-deployment survey that helped identify that he was dealing with a mental illness. I also think this type of process will help identify specific individuals that need mental health services, and I think identifying specific individuals that need treatment is more productive than general outreach that all veterans receive because veterans can often ignore general outreach efforts since they might feel like they do not have a mental illness. Aside from implementing routine processes that help identify individuals that need mental health treatment, I think that the creation of groups of individuals that have gone through similar experiences is crucial. The creation of groups should happen not only among veterans, but also among active military. The veteran in the video talked about how seeking help and getting in groups helped him because it made him feel that he was not alone in the experiences he went through. I like how he talked about how it was much more helpful than medication because talking to other people made him realize he was not alone in his experiences. I also think that talking to a professional or individual that has gone through similar experiences is more helpful than medication in certain cases because medication often has side effects. Aside from the veterans positive experience with getting in groups and talking to individuals, another reason I would recommend the formation of groups as mental health treatment is b"
2110,"I have mixed feelings about society stepping in and mandating treatment because I understand both sides of the spectrum. With that being said, ultimately, I do think society should be allowed to step in and mandate treatment. On one side of the spectrum regarding society stepping in and mandating treatment is that individuals should have free will to decide what they want. I especially think that this is the case when society wants to mandate individuals to take medications, because as we learned medications often have negative effects. Negative side effects with medications includes akathisia, which is distress and discomfort and dystonia, which is sudden muscle contractions. This is the especially the case in instances where individuals have to try a plethora of medications until they find one that helps manage their symptoms. Therefore, I see how one side of the spectrum would be weary in allowing society to step in and mandate treatment.  Ultimately, the reason I think society should mandate treat is because of anosognosia. As we learned this week, many individuals with mental illness might experience anosognosia, which is lack of insight into their mental illness. In fact, it is estimated that 40%-90% of individuals with mental illness suffer from this lack of insight. Additionally, many individuals with mental illness just choose not to seek help because of stigma and how they do not want to be labeled as having a mental illness. The reason I bring this all up is because mental illness is very comparable to physical illness. When someone is physically ill, for example, when someone is diagnosed with cancer, they have insight about their disease and can make the decision to seek treatment or not seek treatment. In addition, cancer is prevalent and not stigmatized, and so individuals with cancer are generally not afraid to reach out and seek treatment. When it comes to mental illness, the symptoms an individual is often experiencing prevents them from having insight into their illness. Also, since mental illness is stigmatized, there is another layer of failing to seek treatment because of an individual's negative perception of mental illness. For that reason, I think that society should step in and mandate treatment so that individuals with mental illnesses are getting the help they need. I do think that stepping in and mandating treatment should not be shoving pills down throats, and in fact, there should be a few general therapy sessions"
2111,"I think that teachings and curricula for students should address all types of stigma related to PWMI, including structural, public, and self-stigma, so that students understand all aspects of mental health stigma. I think that understanding all aspects of stigma is important so that students learn how to combat stigma related to PWMI. The first type of stigma that should be addressed in curriculum is structural stigma, which includes policies of private or governmental institutions that restrict PWMI, such as restricting them from serving in a jury. This often arises when individuals blame PWMI for having a mental illness. One effect of structural stigma is cost shifting, which is when the cost of services for PWMI shifts from states to the national level, which often results in a lack of hospital beds and increases in ER visits. This not only limits the services available to PWMI, but it also leaves them in a vicious cycle where they cannot advocate for their rights because of restrictions put on their rights. Aside from having a lecture to teach structural stigma, curricula should include activities where students learn to recognize policies that hurt PWMI and what they can do as members of society to help advocate for the rights of PWMI. For example, a teacher can ask students whether they think telling PWMI that they cannot vote is structural stigma, and if they do think it is structural stigma, what they can do as a member of society to combat that stigma. This type of learning is crucial because PWMI often lack that social status to protect their own civil rights, and by teaching students about structural stigma, they can learn how to stand up for the rights of PWMI when they get older. Schools should also focus on teaching students about public stigma. As we learned last week, public stigma often arises from the media. The public stigmatizes PWMI in many ways, including in believing in the notion that they are violent. However, this is not the case as most violent acts are not caused by PWMI. In fact, PWMI are about 14 times more likely to be a victim of a violent crime than the individual committing a violent crime. This belief that PWMI are violent often leads individuals to alienate PWMI, which limits their opportunities in participating in society. Additionally, the media rarely portrays successful individuals with stable jobs and their battle with mental illness (Slate et al., 2013). To address all aspects of public stigma, c"
2112,"Hi Nani, I like the point you brought up regarding a president introducing facts that eliminate myths related to mental illness. I think that is a really good point because I think a lot of times beliefs regarding mental health are formed based on false beliefs, and it is important that false beliefs are challenged with facts that are based on research. "
2113,"Hi Danielle, I like the point you bring up about how policymakers are creating a climate of mental illness not being ""real"" when they choose to reduce benefits for mental health care. I agree with this notion. I think the problem for many individuals, including policymakers, is that physical illness means that there is evidence that something is physically wrong with a person, but with mental illness, a lot of times there is no physical evidence that something is wrong. Rather it is symptoms that indicate that a person has mental illness, and a lot of times individuals think someone with a mental illness is making up the symptoms or that they have control over their symptoms. "
2114,"Hi Eva, I agree that any form of counseling is better than resorting to medicating active military and veterans. I think before there is any discussion to whether medication would help alleviate symptoms that one is experiencing, there should be a few individual therapy or group therapy sessions so a person has the chance to talk about their feelings to see if that helps manage their symptoms. "
2115,"Hi Liisa, I like the point you brought up about how society should step in if an individual is being a danger to themselves or others. I like this point because I agree with this, because without society stepping in for these types of instances, people will end up being hurt. Last quarter we learned that a lot of times when society steps in when an individual wants to kill themselves, they resort to psychiatric holds and end up medicating the individual. I think we need to work on what it means when society mandates treatment, because I think that a lot of times medication is not the best course of action, especially since we learned this week that psychiatric medications often have a plethora of negative effects. "
2116,"Hi Stephanie, I like how you brought up that elementary school teachings of mental health should be fun, and I agree. I think younger students benefit more from hand-on activities, especially since they tend to have a shorter attention span in the classroom. I do think that there should be some type of formal learning component for young children just so they are formally introduced to the topic of mental health. In my discussion post I talked about how research has demonstrated that mental health beliefs are formed at a young age, and so I think that a small learning component that demystifies mental health myths is important. For example, a fun fact from our Slate et al. (2013) reading for elementary school kids would be that an individual's chances from being murdered by a psychotic stranger is equal to the chances of being struck by lightning and dying. This kind of fun fact teaches children about mental health, without making them engage in an hour long lecture about the topic.  Something else you brought up was a teacher having student's write down their feelings, and I think that this is a great example. This kind of activity can help students understand that sometimes other people in their classroom have ""sad"" thoughts as well. This reminded me of the video we watched about the veteran and how he said that he really benefited from going to groups with other veterans, because it was at the groups he realized that he realized he was not alone in what he was going through. I think that any activity that sheds light on mental health and makes children realize that they are not alone in their feelings is important because it makes students dealing with actual mental health issues feel less isolated. I think this is even more beneficial when a teacher engages in these group activities because teacher's demonstrate that adults also deal with mental illness or have ""sad"" thoughts once in a while. "
2117,"Hi Alyse, I like the point you brought up about how it is important to talk to high-schoolers about more complicated issues, like the co-occurrence of substance abuse. I think this is very important, especially since as Steve mentioned in his reply post to you, kids are being exposed to drugs and alcohol in middle school now. The National Institute of Drug Abuse reported that about 23% of 8th graders have reported trying alcohol, which means about 1 in 4 8th graders have been exposed to alcohol ( https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/monitoring-future-survey-high-school-youth-trends). This means that the conversation of drugs is not something new to middle schoolers and high schoolers.  I think explaining the relationship of drugs and mental illness to students is important. Our Slate et al. (2013) reading talked about how research demonstrates that having a psychiatric disorder increases the risk of having problems related to drugs. I think this is an example of a topic that can be covered in the classroom. I also think that programs that are implemented in schools that target drug use (like D.A.R.E. or G.R.E.A.T) can start also talking about mental illness. I think if drugs and mental illness are talked about together, it is very important that it is explained in a way where students do not think drugs cause mental disorders because then they will think that individuals with mental disorders brought the symptoms upon themselves by engaging in drugs. "
2118,"Hi Nani, I really like your example of giving elementary school students health pamphlets and providing elementary school parents information about mental health conversations going on in class. I think both are great examples because they are ways to continue the conversation of mental health outside of the classroom. The pamphlets can serve as a resource that children can refer to and by notifying parents of mental health topics covered in class, parents can continue discussions of mental health at home. You also brought up bringing health agencies into schools for presentations for older children. I like that as well because I think that older children would reap more benefits in hearing a presentation by a mental health agency, compared to younger children. I think these presentations would be even more influential if there were presenters that have dealt with or were currently dealing with mental illness and they shared their personal stories. I think the personal stories would show students that there are people out there that have dealt with the symptoms of mental illness and have been able to recover or manage their symptoms. I also think that classes should include mental health topics in their curriculum. I found an interesting study by Milin et al. (2016) that studied the phenomena of mental health topics in curriculum. This study implemented mental health topics into the Healthy Living courses of 30 Canadian schools and found that students that received the mental health curriculum had improved mental health knowledge and decreases in mental health stigma. This is an example of how not only is presentations influential in combating stigma, but also integrating mental health topics into already set curriculum.  Milin, R., Kutcher, S., Lewis, S. P., Walker, S., Wei, Y., Ferrill, N., & Armstrong, M. A. (2016). Impact of a mental health curriculum on knowledge and stigma among high school students: a randomized controlled trial.  Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry,  55(5), 383-391."
2119,"When considering the concept of specificity when it comes to civil commitment, specificity would be the proportion of individuals who are not dangerous to themselves and others, and they are not civilly committed. When considering the concept of sensitivity when it comes to civil commitment, sensitivity would be the proportions of individuals who are dangerous to themselves and others, and they are civilly committed. In an ideal world, specificity and sensitivity for civil commitment would be 100%, but as the video mentioned, this almost never happens. I think in the case of civil commitment, it would be more beneficial to have decisions about civil commitment have increased sensitivity (more able to pick up whether someone is dangerous or not), which would result in less specificity (less able to prove that someone dangerous needs civil commitment). I think increased sensitivity and less specificity is important because civil commitment can result in someone being in a state hospital for years, where they might not even receive the treatment they need because of budget cuts, and so it is important that individuals that are not an actual danger are not being committed. There are also false negatives and false positives when we look at civil commitment. False positives when the individual is not dangerous to society but they are civilly committed because an evaluation deems that they are dangerous. False positives are a risk to the individual being deemed as dangerous because that individual is not actually dangerous, however, they are subjected to civil commitment because a test deems them dangerous. False negatives are when the individual is dangerous to society but they are not civilly committed. False negatives are a risk to society because a test was not able to categorize an individual as dangerous, and as a result, that individual is out in public and can potentially hurt someone."
2120,"I think that involuntary commitment of sex offenders after they complete their sentence is a bad idea. Our lecture this week talked about how civil commitment is controversial because it can be coercive, anti-therapeutic, stigmatizing, and discriminatory. I think all these points are important because the overarching goal of civilly committing a sex offender is to treat that sex offender so that they can are no longer dangerous and can be released. However, majority of times state hospitals and institutions do not provide the treatment that sex offenders need because of constraints, such as coerciveness. Additionally, in our forensic assessment class last quarter, we learned about how the Static-99R is often used after a sex offender serves their prison sentence as an evaluation tool to see if that individual is a sexually violent predator and should be committed to a state hospital. We learned that this test can be imperfect and a lot of times false positives and false negatives arise when evaluators use this test. One reason this happens is because the test takes into consideration factors, such as prior convictions, which can be problematic because sometimes the prior conviction of a sex offender is not relevant to dangerousness. Overall, I think that involuntary commitment is a bad idea for sex offenders because there is the possibility of false positives and false negatives, plus, those that are actually dangerous and committed are often not rehabilitated because the institutions lack the resources to rehabilitate the sex offender."
2121,"I consider inpatient commitment to be the larger reach of authority into an individual’s liberty because individuals in outpatient facilities have more autonomy to make decisions on their own. For example, individual’s in outpatient commitment have the freedom to continue some aspects of their lives in the community. Therefore, they can do things like engage with their friends and families on a regular basis after they report to treatment in an outpatient facility. This autonomy is taken away during inpatient commitment because an individual is not only confined to the facility they are committed in, but the individual has to follow rules set by the facility they are confined in. In inpatient commitment, society is protected, but at the expense of an individual’s liberty because the individual is forced to follow the rules of the facility they are confined in. Something else I wanted to bring up was that in lecture we learned about how outpatient commitment has been criticized because of coerciveness and stigmatization, however such actions also happen in inpatient commitment. For example, we see that individuals in inpatient treatment are often forced into treatment, which can be seen as anti-therapeutic. Also, we see that individuals in inpatient commitment are often seen as dangerous, which creates stigma of individuals in inpatient facilities. Thus, I consider inpatient commitment the larger reach of state authority into an individual’s liberty."
2122,"There are a lot of pros and cons associated with inpatient and outpatient involuntary commitment. As we learned in lecture, some general pros association with both inpatient and outpatient involuntary commitment is treating an individual so that they are no longer a danger to themselves or to others. On the other side of the spectrum are cons of inpatient and outpatient involuntary commitment, which includes coercion of treatment and stigmatization. I think that it is important to have appropriate measures of success for these types of treatments to make sure that both inpatient and outpatient involuntary commitment benefits the individual receiving treatment and society. One way we can measure whether a treatment in inpatient and outpatient involuntary commitment is beneficial to an individual is to make sure that the treatment helps an individual care for themselves. Our Slate et al. (2013) reading this week talks about how civil commitment revolves around parens patriae, which essentially means that it is the government’s duty to be a parent figure to help those that are unable to care for themselves. Thus, when we look at whether a treatment is successful for an individual, we need to look at whether civil commitment has in any way assisted those that are not able to care for themselves. There are many ways that we can look at whether there is an improvement in an individual’s ability to take care of themselves. One way is to look at an individual when they are first civilly committed and to look at elements related to whether they can care for themselves, like whether they are able to feed themselves regularly and bathe themselves regularly. Our reading from the Washington State Institute for Public Policy (2015) talked about how emergency commitment can lead to a 90-day treatment commitment in a lot of states. Knowing that a commitment can be up to 90 days, we can look at individuals the first day they are committed and then again 90 days later to see whether elements related to care improve or not. Another method to measure success is to look at individuals when they enter involuntary commitment and elements related to care. Then, instead of a 90-day follow-up, a follow-up is conducted a few months after they are released to see whether they are able to take care of themselves consistently when they are home. Therefore, if there is an improvement in an individual’s ability to take care of themselves, then the treatment has been successful"
2123,"Hi Asia, I like how you suggested that one way to see if a treatment is successful is to see whether the individual that is committed wants treatment, which is important because a lot of individual’s lack insight into their mental illness. I was reading a few research articles on individuals that lack insight into their mental illness, and apparently this is very common among individuals that are schizophrenic (Rickelman, 2004). The reason I bring up individuals that are schizophrenic is because I think that sometimes researchers look at whether a treatment is successful by grouping all individuals that have been committed. I think that another way to look at whether a treatment is successful is by grouping individuals by their mental illness. For example, if we group individuals by their mental illness, we might see that there is this one treatment that is successful for individuals with schizophrenia, however, the treatment is not successful for individuals with bipolar. This can be useful and provide insight to how some treatments work better for some individuals with a certain mental illness.  You also brought up measuring whether an individual is able to sustain relationships with friends and family as a way to see if a treatment was successful and I really like this point. I think that if an individual is able to sustain relationships because of their treatment, then this can help reduce mental health stigma. This can help reduce stigma because society is now exposed to someone with a mental illness who can have healthy relationships, and this observation might lead individuals to the realization that individuals with mental illness are contributing members of society and should not be viewed as ""other."" Rickelman, B. L. (2004). Anosognosia in individuals with schizophrenia: toward recovery of insight.  Issues in Mental Health Nursing,  25(3), 227-242."
2124,"Hi Steve, I really like the point you brought up about standardized measures presented by case workers as a way to measure the effectiveness of treatment. I like the idea of a standardized process, for both inpatient and outpatient commitment, so that all individuals being committed are going through the same process. I think that it is important that this process is affordable and effective, so that under-funded hospitals and institutions can afford to put individuals through a standardized process and so that individuals that are committed and going through the standardized process benefit from the effectiveness of the process. I also want to point out that Eva, who responded to your post, brought up a really good point about how sometimes we need to alter the evaluation process to meet the needs of certain individuals, especially if research says that individuals with certain mental illnesses need additional steps done when they are first committed. For example, individuals with schizophrenia often report fear of being coerced to mental health treatment (Swartz, Swanson, & Hannon, 2003). This is a great example of how individuals with schizophrenia might have their evaluation process slightly altered so that there is an emphasis that the outpatient or inpatient facility is not trying to coerce them into anything. I think that in addition to standardized measures presented by case workers, that there should be more standardization when we research whether inpatient or outpatient commitment is successful. For example, our Washington State Institute for Public Policy (2015) reading talks about how states define grave disability differently. This is important because if we are looking at whether treatment is successful for those with grave disability, we need to be weary when we make conclusions because of the different definitions of grave disability across states. One state might have a really conservative definition of grave disability, and as a result captures only those that are severely gravely disabled and another state might have a liberal definition, that encompasses those that are not severely gravely disabled.   Swartz, M. S., Swanson, J. W., & Hannon, M. J. (2003). Does fear of coercion keep people away from mental health treatment? Evidence from a survey of persons with schizophrenia and mental health professionals.  Behavioral sciences & the law,  21(4), 459-472."
2125,"Hi Karen, I like how you talked about how employment and education are both factors that signal that an individual is contributing to society. I really like the idea of looking at employment and education when an individual is finished with treatment because I think that this not only signals whether an individual is contributing to society but it also signals whether an individual is able to engage in a long-term goal. Another reason I like this is because I feel like a lot of the measures that have been brought up during discussion are self-reporting measures. For example, someone mentioned looking at whether symptoms have been alleviated, and I feel like to do this, an individual either takes a questionnaire or reports their symptoms to a clinician. A lot of times, an individual can over exaggerate or be bias when they report symptoms in order to make it seem like they are doing well. Looking at education and employment shifts away from self-reporting measures, especially if there is required proof that an individual is going to school or has a job. This is a great way to gather information that is not bias. Something else you brought up that I wanted to touch on is how you talked about how involuntary commitment alleviates family and/or friends from the burden of taking care of an individual's mental health needs. I thought that this was a good point you brought up, but it is also a double edge sword because if the treatment that an individual receives during commitment is not effective, then the individual might have been better off with friends and/or family. "
2126,"I think that all stages in the criminal process would be difficult for PWMI to navigate, however, if I had to choose the most difficult stage for PWMI, I would choose the adjudication process. The adjudication process usually begins with pleas bargaining, which is when the defendant pleads guilty either with a lesser charge, a removal of a charge, a recommendation, or another incentive. Last year in Dr. Quas’ class, we learned the PWMI and children are at a disadvantage when it comes to plea bargains because they often pela at higher rates because they either do not understand the criminal justice process or do not understand the repercussions of pleading. I think that PWMI have difficult during this stage because they might not understand how a plea works, especially if their lawyer does not take the time to explain the pros and cons of taking a plea. For example, a PWMI might take a plea because they think it means they will not go to jail, but they do not understand that they now have a record, which might make it harder for them to get employment or housing. If a person with PWMI does not take a guilty plea, then they will appeal at a trial, either in front of a judge in a bench trial or in front of a jury in a jury trial. I think that appearing at trial is difficult for PWMI because they often do not understand the criminal justice process, and as a result they cannot adequately defend themselves during trial, something else also talked about in Dr. Quas' class. For example, a PWMI on trial might not properly answer questions in a way where they are seen in a positive light because of the confession tactics implemented by a lawyer during cross examination or because of their symptoms, which can impede their reasoning. Also, PWMI are often not give mental health services to help alleviate their symptoms during this stage of the criminal justice process, and so if they are found  fit to stand trial, they have to go to trial while dealing with their symptoms. Overall, I think the most difficult stage for PWMI is the adjudication process."
2127,"Potential challenges that might arise for PWMI with recent changes in California corrections is that local jurisdictions might not have room for PWMI since there is a shift in responsibility for felons from the state to local jurisdiction. The video we watched about cutting California prison sizes talked how Orange County not only did not have enough beds, but they had to close parts of their prisons because they did not have enough money to staff the entire prison. I see this as a challenge because PWMI need mental health care when they enter prisons, and with being forced to go to county jails, where there is overcrowding and budget cuts, they probably would not get the help they need. Rather, the county jails are probably focusing on more pressing concerns, such as overcrowding, and neglect PWMI because they just do not have the resources to help them. Potential benefits that might arise for PWMI with recent changes in California corrections is that a PWMI might get noticed when they are getting transferred. For example, from week 1 we learned about an individual with mental illness that died in a prison because of neglect. If he had been transferred to a county jail, his severe symptoms might have come to light, and he might have gotten the care he deserved before he got transferred. Additionally, when local jurisdictions take over, there is a possibility that local organizations might assist with the needs of PWMI in local jails, and because these organizations are local to the individual, when the individual is released, they can still continue getting help from the local organization because of the relationship they have built with them. Lastly, PWMI might get released quicker because of overcrowding. This can also be a challenge because PWMI have not dealt with their mental health symptoms when they are released, since local jurisdictions do not have the time and money to help them. As a result, when they are released, PWMI might still have symptoms and their symptoms might lead them back in jail. Overall, there are challenges and benefits for PWMI when it comes to the recent changes in California corrections. "
2128,"I do not think it is fair that police serve as first respondents to situations involving PWMI. I do not think that police officers should be first respondents because they do not know how to handle PWMI when they first approach them, especially since the video we watched talked about how PWMI are often killed in confrontation with police officers. As we learned, police officers are not really trained on how to be empathic around PWMI, and so the first responders in situations involving PWMI need to be mental health specialist that are trained on how to respond to situations regarding PWMI. Additionally, police officers often take advantage of PWMI because they know that they lack the means to defend themselves because of the symptoms they deal with. For example, in Dr. Quas’ class we learned that PWMI are often interrogated in a way where false confessions are produced because police officers do not take into consideration that PWMI have symptoms that are making it difficult for them to answer questions to the best of their ability. Even if police officers get training on PWMI, and this training covers topics like empathy and severity of symptoms, I still do not think they should be first responders because their efforts should be directed towards dealing with crime. Additionally, there are so many types of symptoms that PWMI have, and police officers should not be responsible with learning all the symptoms. Mental health specialists are more prepared to be first responders, because they not only have education on PWMI, but they deal with PWMI in their everyday work. Overall, I do not think it is fair that police officers often serve as first responders to situations involving PWMI. "
2129,"CIT and stigma are related because CIT training has been found to potentially reduce stigma towards PWMI among law enforcement officers. There are different ways that CIT training achieves this. One way is that it provides law enforcement with signs and symptoms of mental illness. This is important because it sheds light on the symptoms that PWMI deal with and how they are not just “crazy” but rather they are dealing with an actual illness. I really liked the exercise in the video we watched, which was a police officer receiving commands while hearing voices in their head. This demonstrated that it is difficult for some PWMI to listen to police officer commands because of the voices they hear in their head. I think this is helpful in changing the police officers attitude about mental illness, so that they have a more positive attitude, because it shows that PWMI are not choosing to""act out,"" and rather they have symptoms that inhibit their everyday functioning and reasoning. Another way CIT reduces stigma is through de-escalation techniques. Police officers are taught to take control of a situation quickly, however with CIT, they are also taught that taking control of a situation is hard when someone is having a mental health crisis. They are taught techniques such as how to ask open-ended questions and paraphrase the answer, how to show empathy, and how to engage in actions that help buy time. I think this is related to stigma because it makes officers realize that PWMI can be helped, and shooting should be a last minute resort. Lastly, CIT training covers mental health services, and I think this is important for police officers because it exposes them to the community that involves PWMI. By being exposed to the mental health community, they are less likely to see PWMI as ""other"" and more like peers that are part of the community. Overall, CIT and stigma are related in different ways. "
2130,"I think that Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) training programs should still be implemented but they should be modified. The Taheri (2016) article we read this week is about a meta-analysis on CIT models to see the effectiveness of these CIT models. Taheri (2016) found that there was not enough evidence to conclude that the CIT models reduced office injury during encounters between law enforcement and PWMI and that there is some evidence that CIT models had no effect on other outcomes, such as arrests and officer use of force. Additionally, the Taheri (2016) article talks about how officers that received CIT training were more likely to transport a PWMI to a services with community resources, rather than arresting them, however, these findings were null and not significant. This meta-analysis demonstrated that the CIT model is currently not beneficial but it is also not harmful. The video we watched this week on CIT training programs touches on the CIT training in St. Paul, and demonstrates some positive aspects of CIT training. The CIT training in St. Paul comprises of 40 hour training on dealing with PWMI. This training includes trained actors playing the role of someone mentally ill, and officers learning to approach PWMI slowly, to ask open-ended questions, and to paraphrase the answers they are given to demonstrate that they were listening. The officers were also taught about empathy and how to de-escalate certain situations. The video makes it seem like CIT training is great and effective because officers are receiving training on how to deal with PWMI, and this type of training is usually not done. Not only that, but the personal anecdote of the police officer in the video really shed light on how he has used his CIT training in his everyday work and how it has helped him approach PWMI. Thus, the video we saw this week shows CIT training in a more positive light, compared to Taheri (2016) that talked about CIT models not being beneficial or harmful.  Given that Taheri (2016) demonstrated that the CIT model is not as effective as it seems, but the video we watched demonstrates CIT training in a positive light, I think we should keep CIT model but we should modify it. First, I think that the overarching goal of CIT training, which is teaching police officers how to deal with PWMI, should be kept. This is a great goal and should be the root purpose of the training, especially since our Slate et al. (2013) reading talks about how police"
2131,"Hi Stephanie, I like the idea you brought up about continuing to use CIT training and making it mandatory for police officers. Our Slate et al. (2013) reading talks about how NAMI has endorsed CIT training and encourages implementation nationwide. Our Slate et al. (2013) reading also talked about stories of police officers that used CIT training in their actual work, such as the story of how this police officer saved someone’s life because of the actions he carried out because he was a Crisis Intervention Team Officer. There was also another story about a police officer and how he was able to help a schizophrenic man, which is another example of the importance of CIT training among police officer. I think the NAMI endorsement and stories of police officers are important because it sheds light on how CIT training should be implemented nationwide and should be made mandatory. When making CIT training nationwide and mandatory, it is important that CIT training is adapted for different communities and settings, something the Slate et al. (2013) reading talked about. For example, sometimes it doesn’t make sense for CIT training to stress the importance of community intervention because some communities lack the resources to have mental health organizations. Like McKenna, I also like your idea about having a trained professional accompany a police officer. I have attended a few supervisory training programs at work and once I am back in the office, I realized it is really difficult to implement the trainings I learned because I am not sure how to implement the skills I learned. I wouldn’t be surprised if police officers that go through CIT training experience this too. It might be helpful for police officers to have a trained professional so they know how to implement CIT training effectively in their everyday lives. "
2132,"Hi Suz, I like the point you brought up about how CIT training being optional creates skew results, especially since those that volunteer for CIT training are a special population that are more likely to implement CIT in their work because they chose to attend the training. This made me think of Dr. Zinger’s research class and how we learned the importance of random selection when we study a phenomena and how it is superior to self-selection. In cases of self-selection, there is always a special characteristic of individuals that choose to be in a study, and this special characteristic often skews the results of the study. Random selection is better because it controls for biases and confounds that often lead to skew results.  I also like your point about having more data. Taheri (2016) searched for studies related to CIT using several databases, but ultimately chose seven studies. I do not think the seven studies were enough to make conclusions about CIT training, and I think is evident when Taheri (2016) could not make conclusive remarks about officer injury because of the lack of data. Not only does there need to be more data, but the data needs to be consistent. Our Slate et al. (2013) reading talks about how there are often modifications of CIT training based on the precinct. I think that these differences need to be taken into consideration. Not only should they be taken into consideration, but there should also be qualitative studies that intake interviews from participants. Implementing interviews with open-ended questions gives a more holistic perspective of what police officers think of CIT training and it also gives a better idea of how to modify CIT trainings so that it has more positive outcomes. For example, asking a police officer “How often do you use skills obtained from CIT training when responding to a call with a schizophrenic person?” does not provide a lot of insight because it typically leads to a number response. Asking a police officer “What skills do you use from CIT training when responding to a call with a schizophrenic person?” is a more open-ended question that provides insight to what skills police officers use from CIT training and what skills they do not use. In addition to analyzing CIT with different methods, I also think CIT training needs to be compared to other programs that strive to reduce PWMI in the criminal justice system. For example, an article by Lamb and Bachrach (2001) talks about having me"
2133,"To be a PWMI and to be arrested and jailed more than 100 times must be horrific. The video we watched talked about Cook County Jail, which houses the largest PWMI population, and how there are some PWMI that have been there up to 100 times, and the sheriff even noted that someone has been in here 400 times. The sheriff talked about how PWMI are usually jailed because of retail theft or criminal trespass, which they usually do because they are stealing something for themselves or breaking into a place to sleep. This demonstrates that PWMI often engage in non-violent crimes as a last resort for survival. When PWMI are jailed, they are usually placed there for several days or months, and then sent home with a pocket of pills and no plan. I think this experience for PWMI must be horrific. First, they are criminalized for mental health problems they often can not control, and once they are criminalized, the jails do not have the resources to attend to their mental health needs. Then, when they are released, they become part of a vicious cycle where they are probably going to commit another crime because their mental health needs have not been met. I do not only think this is horrific for a PWMI, but I also think they must be tired and angry. They are constantly being criminalized, which is often a cycle that happens numerous of times. Overall, I think being a PWMI that has been arrested and jailed more than 100 times is not only horrific, but also tiring and frustrating."
2134,"I think that indicators are important because they are a standard way of measuring and comparing a problem or area of focus. When it comes to jails and how they measure mental illness, I think there are different key indicators that can help show the relationship between mental illness and jails. First, I think it is important to look at PWMI that have been jailed at least once, and to see how many times they return to jail, so in other words, the recidivism rate of mentally ill individuals. This indicator can be the average number of times a PWMI ends up in jail. I think that this indicator is important because it demonstrates the average number of times PWMI returns to jail, and sheds light on whether or not going to jail deters them from being criminalized again. A second indicator is to see the average number of times a PWMI receives mental health treatment while they are jailed. This indicator is important because it reflects on the quality of care in jails by showing whether or not PWMI in jails are coming in contact with mental health services, because if they are not coming into contact with mental health services while in jail, that might be one of the reasons that their mental health symptoms do not improve. A third indicator is to see the average number of days PWMI stays in jail. The average number of days is important for the government to see the cost of a standard stay of a PWMI and for jails to see whether they need to implement more short term or long term treatment for PWMI, since the average number of days will shed light on how long PWMI actually stay in jails. "
2135,"I think that jail inmates are given an appropriate amount of rights, however, I feel like sometimes their rights are vague and abused. The reason that I think inmates are given an appropriate amount of rights is because they have certain constitutional rights while in jail. For example, jail inmates still have the right to free speech, even though that there are limits to this if they do not pass the Turner Test. I do not think the Turner Test is that clear and some of the questions are a little ambiguous, so I can see prison officials using the vagueness of the test to abuse it. For example, when asking whether a speech is related to a legitimate government interest, some people might be split on certain types of speech because people define government interest differently. Therefore, something that might not pass the Turner Test in one jail might pass the Turner Test in another jail, which I do not think is fair. I think another important right that prisoners have is the eighth amendment, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. However, this is another right I think that gets abused because cruel and unusual punishment can be defined differently. For example, some of the videos we watched during lecture have showed PWMI being put into isolation and tied up for long periods of time, which is something I would consider as cruel and unusual punishment, but jail officials might not consider this as cruel and unusual punishment. Jail inmates also have freedom of religion, and there are steps taken to not discriminate jail inmates passed on race, religion, or gender, healthcare which I think are all important to have. I do want to note that I think that jail inmates being subject to a search anytime or losing the right to vote, are rights that they lack, and so I think the rights of jail inmates can be improved by giving them these rights, in addition to the rights they already have.  I also think that jail inmates should have the right to bring up any unfair treatment or any violation of the their rights, so that their rights are not abused. "
2136,"I think medication is the most common form of treatment for persons with mental illness in jails because it is the easiest form of treatment. First, medication is a short term mental health treatment, and often short term mental health treatments are easy because they immediately provide some type of treatment or relief to a person with mental illness while they are in the jail. I feel like jails also like treatment that is short, like medication, because short forms of treatment alleviates symptoms just long enough for the person to leave the jail, and once the person leaves the jail and sees their symptoms comes back, they are no longer the responsibility of the jail. Second, other forms of treatment such as telepsychiatry and psychotherapeutic treatment, both take up the time of mental health specialists. To hire mental health specialist is expensive and to divert their time to treating individuals with mental illness is time consuming. It is much easier for a psychiatrist to just give medication to a person with a mental illness because they just put in an order and once the order is in, someone gives them the medication. The fact that giving out medication takes up a short period of time means that a psychiatrist can see numerous inmates in a given day, rather than a counselor that would see only a limited amount of inmates because he or she would have to do long sessions with an inmate to help them with their mental health problem. On top of that, we learned that sometimes persons with mental illness are already taking medications when they enter the jails, so in some cases all the psychiatrist has to do is either keep prescribing the same medication or modify it to meet the needs of the person with mental illness. I think that giving out medications is problematic because persons with mental illness often need other types of treatment, like counseling, in order to help alleviate their symptoms.  "
2137,"The fact that there are an alarming number of PWMI in jails and prisons brings up the question of whether using jails for PWMI is appropriate or inappropriate. I think that the use of jails for PWMI is inappropriate given a plethora of factors, such as funding, architectural, and operational constraints. To understand why jails are inappropriate for PWMI, it is important to know that a vast number of PWMI get sent to jails. In the United States, there are more than three times more PWMI in our jails and prisons, than in hospitals receiving care (Torrey, Kennard, Eslinger, Lamb, & Pavle, 2010). This means PWMI are being put in jails and prisons, rather than mental hospitals. Additionally, at least 16% of individuals in jails and prisons have a serious mental illness and 40% of PWMI have been in jail or prison at some point of their lives (Torrey et al., 2010). In fact, jails have come the largest psychiatric institution in the United States (Slate el al., 2013). These statistics demonstrate how a PWMI has a high chance with coming into contact with a jail in some point of their life. Our Slate et al. (2013) reading this week talks about how PWMI arrests are usually for minor, non-violent crimes, which means that PWMI are not being jailed for being violent crimes, most of the time. Rather, PWMI come into contact with jails because their behavioral problems are seen as problematic and so jails are used to confine them to provide security to the public. Thus, it is important to know that there are a large number of PWMI in jails, because this sheds light on how the inappropriateness of PWMI being jailed is affecting thousands of individuals.   The first reason that the use of jails for PWMI is inappropriate is because PWMI that are arrested for non-violent crimes should be receiving community health services, rather than being jailed. Our Slate et al. (2013) reading talks about how many PWMI often have nowhere to turn when they have severe symptoms, and when there are services available, there usually isn’t a bed available. This leads to PWMI to be arrested and incarcerated as a way to receive mental health services. I think the example of Lyn Hill’s son in the Slate et al. (2013) reading shows how severe this issue is. Her son was turned down by treatment programs and was put on waiting lists and he missed a court date due to his psychiatric instability, and so when police officers found her son in a crisis state, they arrested him because of h"
2138,"Hi Jennifer, I like how you brought up that operational constraints in the jail system may cause the most significant negative outcome on PWMI. I had to think about that statement for a second because funding and architectural constraints are also impactful, however, I do think you bring up a really good point and I do agree that operational constraints have the ability to cause the most significant negative outcome on PWMI. I think that jails that lack the funding to have a three stage triage process is one major operational constraint that effects PWMI, something you mentioned as well. The lack of this process means that when PWMI enter the jail system, they are placed with the general population, which means that they are still dealing with the symptoms from their mental illness because they are receiving no treatment. Based on the videos we watched this week, I have a feeling that when a PWMI that is in the general population acts out because of their symptoms, they are placed in isolation for their bad behavior, rather than put in treatment to get help for their mental illness. I also think that jails that having a low quality triage process also effect PWMI because a significant number of PWMI might fall through the cracks. For example, a PWMI might enter a jail and during the screening by a jail staff, the jail staff might not recognize some of the symptoms of an individual with a serious mental illness and not even pass the individual to the latter two stages of assessment and evaluation. I can see this happening when jail staff are not trained that well regarding symptoms of individuals with mental disorders because they might not know what kind of behavior is abnormal and what kind of behavior is normative. For example, from our Slate et al. (2013) reading earlier this quarter, we learned about how major symptoms of bipolar disorder are mania and depression, and sometimes the mania manifests into excessive energy and inability to concentrate. A jail staff that is not a trained to the degree of a mental health specialist might see behaviors influenced by mania just an inmate being “difficult” and them choosing to “act out.” However, the maniac symptoms may be affecting the actions and decision making capabilities of the inmate, so it is crucial that this is recognized because then the inmate needs some kind of mental health treatment to alleviate their symptoms."
2139,"Hi Nicolle, I like how you brought up the amount it costs to house a regular inmate in a jail and a PWMI in jail because it really puts into perspective how much more expensive it is to house a PWMI. I can see this cost difference as a reason for higher-ups in jails to push lower staff in jails to be very strict when classifying an inmate as a PWMI, because being more strict means that less individuals get classified as PWMI, which means that the jail saves money because PWMI jail inmates are expensive. When I was writing my discussion post, I came across jail diversion programs, which are essentially programs that take PWMI that have committed misdemeanors from the criminal justice system and places them into treatment as a way to reduce recidivism so that pWMI do not end up back in the jails. This means that costs of a PWMI inmate is shifted from overcrowded prisons to the community. I think that from an outside perspective, this seems like an expensive intervention, however I found a study by Cowell, Broner, and Dupont (2004) that found that in New York City and Memphis, jail diversion programs lead to lower jail costs of an inmate. This shows that there are interventions out there that can bring the cost of housing a PWMI down to the same cost of housing a regular inmate. The amount to house an inmate you mentioned was an amount from almost 10 years ago, plus it was in the state of Florida, and it got me thinking how much it is to house an inmate in California present day. I couldn’t find a statistic that showed the per day or yearly amount at the jail level, but I did find the 2018 - 2019 yearly amount to house an inmate in California prisons on the California’s Legislative Analyst’s Office website ( https://lao.ca.gov/PolicyAreas/CJ/6_cj_inmatecost). I really like this website because in addition to the yearly amount to house an inmate, it also gives the breakdown costs to house an inmate. In the breakdown cost, it has reception testing, and assignment as a cost, which is very similar to the three stage triage process we learned about this week. I was surprised to see that the process costs about $150 for the prisons to do. I can see why some jails and prisons with financial constraints deliberately skip the triage process, since skipping the process saves money.  Cowell, A. J., Broner, N., & Dupont, R. (2004).

2140,"The video talks about how officers use risk assessment tools during pretrial service reports to say if an offender is low risk or not and the judge uses the assessment tool when making a decision on the case of the offender. A judge also looks at a comprehensive pre-sentence report to make a sentencing decision. After watching this video, I do not think it is fair to use these assessment tools when they are not 100% accurate. The seminar video really shed light about the roles of probation officers and how they try to help rehab offenders while keeping the community safe. It seems like they take a  holistic approach, for example they build relationships with the offenders families and teach them cognitive skills so that they know how to make better decisions in situations they cannot control. I think the traffic scenario where the police officer taught the lady how to not get mad when someone cuts her off is a great example of a probation officer working to help an individual think in a non-criminalizing way. It demonstrates how the probation officer is teaching a skill to help the person make a better decision. Additionally, the probation officers and judge also talked about how a lot of times external factors, such as the economy being bad and the feeling of being defeated because of not finding a job, is a reason to why offenders have so much hard time when they get released. The reason I bring this up is because assessment tools bring up things like criminal history and rehabilitation, and I feel like they do not really capture the holistic nature of the offender. For example, an offender might go back to prison and be assessed as dangerous, even though the reason they went back to prison was because of a bad economy and they could not find a job or for mental health reasons, and assessment tools was not able to capture this. Assessment tools, from what we learned in Professor Scurich’s class are more interested in whether an offender meets a factor or not, and not the holistic nature of an offender. "
2141,"I think that mental health professionals would be receptive to the RNR approach if they do not have a stigma that PWMI are violent and dangerous. As the video talked about, headlines about PWMI influence our perception of PWMI in a negative way, but when we look at studies, there is not a valid pattern between mental illness and crime. In fact, one study found that majority of offenders were not motivated by mental illness, and instead were motivated by poverty, homelessness, and substance abuse. If mental health professionals understand where PWMI are coming from, and how it is not from a place of violence, then I think they would be receptive to using the RNR model. I also think they would be receptive if they had more resources. In the seminar video we watched in the last module, the probation officers and judge was asked what could help them do what they do more effectively, and they said more money and resources. I also think mental health professionals would be receptive to the RNR approach because it emphasizes treating PWMI, and the goal of mental health professionals is often to help individuals with mental illness, whether it is through helping alleviate their symptoms or providing support. When it comes to other factors besides recidivism, I think that when we look at PWMI under supervision in the community, we should look at factors such as homelessness, poverty, and substance abuse because these factors motivate a lot of offenders to commit crimes. I think employment is important as well because it gives an offender a routine every day and it also gives the money for things like rent and food."
2142,"Based on the video, I think that probation is set up in a way to address the supervision and treatment of PWMI, because they are focused on treatment, however there are rooms of improvement when it comes to probation. Probation is focused on getting individuals in touch with programs and organization that can help them with different aspects of their life, like securing housing and employment. I do think they need to pay special attention to PWMI because even if they are offered different services, they might have trouble with it because their symptoms might impact their decision making. The video sounds like PWMI do not have a special focus, and rather there is a general focus on rehabilitation on all offenders. Thus, I do think there needs to be additional steps taken when dealing with PWMI because a lot of times their symptoms make it harder for them to be active members of the community. With that being said, I do think probation is much better than jails. Last week we learned about how jails are overcrowded and lack funding for PWMI, and as a result PWMI are put in overcrowded jails and a lot of times they do not get any treatment for their mental illness. This means that PWMI in jails do not get the treatment they need and are isolated and stigmatized in jails. If they were in the community, they might have a better chance of getting better because they have a probation officer that supports them. The chief probation officer also talked about how the cost of having an individual on probation is about $1,500, compared to the cost to house a prison which is about $50,000. This also demonstrates how probation is also better than jail in terms of saving money. If people realize they are saving money by having an individual on probation, they might pour more money into PWMI on probation."
2143,"I would actually be happy if I pass the screening and I am accepted to a mental health court. Mental health courts stress the importance of treatment for PWMI, and so if I was PWMI, I would feel like I was placed on the right path to getting better. I feel like a traditional court proceeding would not attend to my needs, since traditional courts are very adversarial, legalistic, and efficient. This means that they are more concerned with getting cases through than the treatment of a PWMI. In a mental health court, the focus is more therapeutic jurisprudence, meaning kinder, more gentler, and more rehab focus. In fact, mental health courts also act as social workers, which is a shift to healing and away from retribution. That means as a participant in the mental health court, I would get more focus on the treatment I need. I also like the idea if that I was part of a mental health court, I would have more frequent hearings where there are individual reports to a judge by an attorney, because I feel like the courts have a more active role in my recovery, and that might make me less inclined to recidivate. In addition to the treatment and the overseeing that I return to the community safety, I also like how mental health courts reduce the frequency and duration of emergency services, are in contact with a probation officer every week, and have a licensed social worker on staff that can help be when I am in a crisis or help tweak my probation condition based on my mental health needs. I think all these aspects are important to a PWMI getting better, which is why I would prefer to be part of a mental health court, rather than a traditional court proceeding."
2144,"The Skeem, Steadman, and Manchak (2015) reading this week talks about how the risk-need-responsivity (RNR) model has been emphasized these past few years as a way to reduce recidivism, jail days, and criminal justice costs among PWMI. This meta-analysis study looked at empirical studies that have looked at the RNR model to see the effectiveness of the RNR model. Skeem et al. (2015) concluded that there is a lack of empirical support for the notion that RNR models improve public safety and public health goals for PWMI. With the findings of Skeem et al. (2015) demonstrating that the RNR model does not necessarily help PWMI, I think that elements of the RNR model should be used, along with other types of interventions, when giving a Chief Probation Officer guidance and recommendations for the supervision of PWMI on probation. The first recommendation I would give a Chief Probation Officer is that the current RNR model focuses on interventions and treatments on higher-risk offenders, and I think we need to shift away from this. Our lecture talks about how focus on low risk offenders with intensive treatment programs can harm offenders and lead to worse outcomes. I do understand this perspective, especially since a study by Castillo and Fiftal (2011) talks about how high risk offenders have high risks of recidivism, compared to medium and low risk offenders. However, this same article talks about how alcohol was a contributing factor for PWMI in increasing re-arrests for violent offenses, which is consistent with other studies that have looked at PWMI and have found that violent behavior was more likely with substance abuse problems. I think that instead of having probation focus on high risk offenders, attention should be shifted to all offenders, and factors that make an individual a high risk offender, like an alcohol abuse problem. The second recommendation is that probation officers should be very individualistic when approaching PWMI, and should look at individual and environmental risk factors, rather than assuming PWMI are a homogenous group, which is an element of the RNR model. Our lecture talks about the importance of focusing on criminogenic needs related to crime, such as substance abuse and antisocial behavior, because these risk factors are dynamic and can be changed with treatment. Our Peterson, Skeem, Kennealy, and Bray (2014) reading talked about how the extent to which symptoms of PWMI influence criminal behavior varies wit"
2145,"Hi Eva, I like the point you brought up regarding there needs to be more research regarding the RNR model and I agree. I found an article, published after the Skeem et al. (2015) article, by Viglione (2019), that looked at the RNR model four years later after the Skeem et al. (2015) article and in a similar fashion, this article could not reach any conclusive argument regarding the RNR model. This study found that when it came to probation officers implementing RNR principles from the RNR model, their implementation was often misaligned with the implementation derived from research. This mean that probation officers did not really use the risk and needs assessment to inform decision making, create case plans, and provide referrals to treatments. This study highlights that in addition to reviewing the principles of the RNR model, we also need to continue researching the implementation of it by probation officers, so that it is implemented in a way that is effective for PWMI on probation. I also like the point you brought up regarding how despite the available research on RNR model, it does not mean that the RNR model is ineffective. I like how you brought up different ways probation officers can strengthen their interactions with PWMI, in addition to elements from the RNR model. For example, Wormith and Zidenberg (2018) talk about how when the RNR model emphasizes high risk offenders, this is often because scarcity of resources force the RNR model to focus on a certain aspect of PWMI. I think that instead of focusing on high risk offenders, we should take the RNR model and pair it with other interventions so that PWMI on probation are getting the help they need so they do not recidivate. I like your idea of building rapport as one way to strengthen the RNR model. I think this is important because it reduces stigma of PWMI, since as we learned last week, building relationships with PWMI reduces stigma of PWMI. In my own post I also talked about things like cognitive behavioral therapy and the importance of mental health courts, which I also think would strengthen the RNR model. Whatever interventions are used to strengthen the RNR model, I think it is important that research is done to make sure the implementations of the RNR model are effective for PWMI on probation.

2146,"Hi Asia, I like the point you brought up regarding telling a Chief Probation Officer that few crimes are driven by the symptoms of mental disorders that PWMI experience. I think the Peterson et al. (2014) reading did a good job of going over this concept, and how for only a small group of offenders would psychiatric treatment have prevented the criminal behavior they engaged in. I think this is important because the RNR model really pushes for treatment, but it is important that PWMI on probation engage with other services as well, such as services that help with housing and employment. An article by Van Deinse, Cuddeback, Wilson, and Burgin (2018) talks about how engaging PWMI on probation with services that are not treatment services is often difficult. For example, the study talks about how probation officers find that PWMI are difficult to supervise because of lack of employment opportunities for this particular population. The article also talks about how local agencies and probation officers can benefit if there is an increased focus on coordinating mental health and other community based services, such as services that focus on housing and employment. I agree with this notion because it is important that probation officers take a holistic approach with PWMI on probation, and helping them with non-mental health aspects of their life is just as important as helping them with mental health aspects of their life. Therefore, it would be beneficial for probation officers to not only focus on treatments in the community, but to build relationships with other services that focus on aspects like housing and employment. For example, probation officers can create relationships with government agencies, and when a job opening appears, government agencies can reach out to probation officers see if a PWMI on probation would be a good fit for that position. It would be easier for a government agency to reach out to a single probation officer they are familiar with when there is a job opening, rather than reaching out to a PWMI on probation because they are often not familiar with PWMI on probation and how to reach out to them.  Van Deinse, T. B., Cuddeback, G. S., Wilson, A. B., & Burgin, S. E. (2018). Probation officers’ perceptions of supervising probationers with mental illness in rural and urban settings.  American Journal of Criminal Justice,  43(2), 267-277."
2147,"I think that the punitive methods in which an inmate is put into solitary confinement without any review or questions might aggravate the symptoms of a PWMI because PMWI need help with their mental symptoms, and when they are locked away they do not get the help they need. I think the isolation heightens their symptoms because they are alone to relive their symptoms, when in reality they need to talk it out with a mental health professional or some kind of intervention that lessens their symptoms. The video also talked about mental health units and how this isolates PWMI from the prison population, and I think this goes hand-in-hand with isolation because once again, PWMI are being separated, and in the case of segregation, they are begin stigmatized because the prisons do not think PWMI can be with the normal population of prisoners. Additionally,  the video also talked about how prisoners sometimes get official beatings, which are cell extractions, and I think this would also aggravate symptoms of PWMI because they are all of a sudden being attacked by prison guards for wrongful behavior, when in reality they need a more empathetic approach when they misbehave so they learn not to misbehave again. I think this is even worse in cases where PWMI do not realize that they are in trouble because their symptoms block their decision making abilities, because in these cases PWMI do not realize that segregation is a type of punishment and so the punishment doesn't even work because PWMI do not realize what is going on. I think the mental health transition center is a great approach that does not aggravate the conditions of PWMI because it helps PWMI with behavior problems they are dealing with, which in turn teaches them skills, like how to hold a job. Such skills are important so that PWMI do not reoffend."
2148,"I think it is possible to rehabilitate prisoners with mental illness, especially if there are resources in prisons dedicated to helping PWMI. The psychologist gave the example of how guards often interpret symptoms of PWMI as non-compliant and aggressive, which demonstrates how there are situations in prisons that make the symptoms of PWMI worse. I think it is important to view PWMI as individuals that can improve with treatment and interventions, because treatments and interventions can help them control their symptoms. I think that the psychologist in the video brought up a really good point about how when PWMI enter prisons their symptoms are often exacerbated because they are in a new environment, however, the stress eases off when they are serving their sentence, and then often re-emerges when they get released. This shows how we need to divert attention to helping PWMI deal with stress as a way to help them rehabilitate. The psychologist in the video also mentioned how when prisoners with PWMI get released, it is important that there are resources available to them, like group therapy, individual counseling sessions, medications, and skills trainings. These kinds of resources and trainings can help them with different domains of their life, like how manage anger and how not to respond aggressively to people. I think that little steps, which includes time and resources, makes it possible to truly rehabilitate PWMI. "
2149,"It seems like the main advantages of solitary confinement is that an individual that is a threat to security or a threat to the safety of others is locked up so that order within the prison is remained. This is an advantage not only to prisoners, but also to prison staff because it is a solution to deal with a difficult inmate. Other than that advantage, it seems like there are more disadvantages of solitary confinement. For example, the video talked about how an individual that had experienced solitary confinement had begun to develop paranoia and violent thoughts, something he had not experienced before. He also became sensitive to sounds. The emergence of these symptoms was because he was in the cell all day and just walked around in the cell all day to stay sane. He indicated that some of the symptoms remained when he was released from solitary confinement, like how he was frightened and felt no emotions. This case example of an individual who has experienced solitary confinement and how the experiences really changed who he was and saw a negative part of himself that he did not like sheds light on how prevalent disadvantages of solitary confinement are. These disadvantages really outweigh the advantages because the advantage of solitary confinement can be done in a different way. For example, when someone is being a threat to security, having them receive an intervention might make more sense that solitary confinement."
2150,"I am okay with my tax dollars being spent on treating PWMI in prisons. I understand the need for funds to revamp buildings for PWMI and to also hire more staff and officers. I have worked in an understaffed environment before where I was underpaid and my department experienced a high turnover rate because people were so unhappy because of high workloads and little pay, and so I see the importance of having money go into staffing. I also don't mind money being spent treatments and interventions on PWMI because it will help them in the long-term, especially when they are released from prisons. This is important because spending more attention on PWMI while they are in prisons will reduce the recidivism rate because if we can help PWMI with their symptoms while they are in prisons, then chances are that when they are released, their symptoms are not that persuasive and they have less of a reason to recidivate. The video also mentioned pouring funds into community based mental healthcare, which I see the need for that too, as I think a community approach is a better way to avoid long term costs. I also want to add that I do not mind my tax dollars being spent on PWMI in prisons because my tax dollars are currently being spent on initiatives I do not support, and I support the initiative of PWMI getting help in prisons, and so I do not mind tax dollars being spend on treating PWMI in prisons."
2151,"I think that there are different ways that prisons can meet the needs the needs of inmates and staff, while treating PWMI inmates, however, it is very difficult to do this while maintaining costs. In most cases, PWMI inmates need additional resources, such as additional mental health care and treatments, to have their needs met. With that being said, I can think of a few examples of keeping inmates and staff safe and treating PWMI inmates, while maintaining costs. One way, is changing the way we handle PWMI and supermax isolation cells, which is something important to consider since correctional systems place a disproportionate number of PWMI in supermax confinement, as a way to ignore the therapeutic help that PWMI prisoners need (Haney, 2003). I think in a perfect world, I would want to get rid of supermax completely, but since we learned from lecture, the goal of many prison officials is safety and security, and supermax helps them achieve this. The problem with locking PWMI inmates in supermax isolation cells is that it exacerbates negative psychological symptoms that PWMI experience (Haney, 2003). An article by Haney (2003) suggests different ways to address this issue, and some of the solutions suggested that helps prisons maintain costs includes allowing prisoners out-of-cell time and strict time limits on how long a PWMI prisoner, or any prisoner, is placed in a supermax isolation cell. The reason that out-of-cell time is important is because giving PWMI inmates time out of jails decreases the chance that their social skills and social identities decrease (Haney, 2003). The reason that strict time limits is important for PWMI inmate is because no prisoner should be subjected to supermax isolation cells indefinitely (Haney, 2003). The Haney (2003) article talks about how it is important that prison staff help PWMI transition from supermax to the normal population. I think the video we watched in lecture highlights the importance of this, as an individual with personal experience in supermax talked about how he had trouble making friends and felt alone in his thoughts when he was first released from supermax since the psychological symptoms he experienced in supermax persisted when he was released from supermax. Helping a PWMI inmate with out-of-cell time and strict time limits does not cost the prison any money, and rather is just an organizational change that needs to happen in the prison. Thus, changing way that prison staff deal with PWMI inma"
2152,"Hi Asia, I thought you brought up an interesting point of separating PWMI inmates from certain conditions in the prison environment. At first, I was against this notion because I felt that separating PWMI inmates would lead to the stigmatization of PWMI inmates. I felt that separation would affect correctional officers in the sense that they would stigmatize PWMI inmates, which can lead to negative consequences. For example, I found a study by Callahan (2004) that talked about how correctional officers view PWMI inmates less favorably that normal inmates, and how this stigma can lead to negative consequences such as victimization and denial of rights. I also think that inmates in the normal population would stigmatize PWMI inmates that are seperated because PWMI inmates would be viewed as “other.” Additionally, a few weeks ago we learned about how individuals that come in contact with PWMI see a reduction in mental health stigma, and there is no way to combat mental health stigma when PWMI inmates are seperated and not in contact with the normal population  With all that being said, I think you bring up some valid points of instances where PWMI should be separated. For example, when they have trouble socializing or when they engage in self—injurious behaviors, it makes sense to separate PWMI inmates. It is important that the new space they are placed in has treatments and interventions that attend to their mental health symptoms so that they get better. I also think they should be reintegrated with the normal population at some point before they are released. I think this is important so that when PWMI inmates re-enter society, they know how to communicate with individuals that do not have a mental illness, and so they also have some level of functioning where they do not have to be dependent on constant 24/7 treatment and supervision. Callahan, L. (2004). Correctional officer attitudes toward inmates with mental disorders.  International Journal of Forensic Mental Health,  3(1), 37-54."
2153,"Hi Nicolle, I like your recommendation of prioritizing what is needed, and how you find spending money on staff as something that needs to be prioritized. I like this point, because in my own post I talked about a few solutions to help PWMI inmates that include prison staff, such as teaching clinicians ways to be more effective in the way they interact with inmates and CIT training for correctional officers. I think that hiring more staff is one way to make sure that these solutions get implemented. For example, an overworked clinician might not take the time to learn about how to be more effective with PWMI inmates, because she or he is just focused on seeing as many inmates as possible during an 8 hour day, since there are so many inmates in jails and prisons with a mental illness. However, if there are more clinicians hired and the workload of existing clinicians decreases, the clinicians might be more open to going to trainings to learn about effective skills they can use with PWMI inmates. When it comes to correctional officers, I found a study by Tewksbury and Higgins (2006) that talks about how the stress correctional officers experience is due to organizational issues, such as role conflict and task control, and how interactions with inmates actually reduces stress. This sheds light on how pouring money into organizational issues might help staff. My job is actually related to organizational issues. My position was created because the school I work for has department inefficiencies and they needed someone to go to the different departments to create effective workflows. I wasn’t a big fan this position at first, because it felt weird going into a novel environment and changing the organization. However, I have an IT background and I found that I was able to hep departments be more effective with technology tools. The reason I bring this up because when it comes to putting money into staffing, having an outside consultant help with organizational change might be a good idea, especially if the consultant has a background on PWMI inmates and how they function within prisons and jails. Tewksbury, R., & Higgins, G. E. (2006). Prison staff and work stress: The role of organizational and emotional influences.  American Journal of criminal justice,  30(2), 247-266."
2154,"If I was a taxpayer, I would be happy about the construction of the Fulton State Hospital. The video talked about how this new hospital would be focused on safe, humane, and more effective modern treatment. For example, the video talked about when Fulton was discovered, they did not even implement group therapy, but now the hospital was going to work towards having group therapy programs as a way to give individuals the chance to be in groups so they can help themselves. I also liked how the video talked about being the leaders in treatments in state hospitals, and I liked that because it seems like they are taking a type of approach where they are focused on implementing effective programs and researching these programs to make sure they work. I went on fultonrebuild.mo.gov to see what else the hospital planned on implementing, and saw a lot of different types of treatments and programs that I think would be effective for PWMI. For example, the rebuilding proposal talked about the implementation of a vocational activity space and recreational activity space, which I think is important for PWMI to have so they can participate in a wide array of activities than can help them reintegrate into society. The proposal also talked about utilizing the dual diagnosis program they have, which I think is really important, because last week we learned about how PWMI often have a dual diagnosis with substance abuse disorder and need to be in treatments that address their dual diagnosis."
2155,"I would not consider the NGRI defense as a “get out of jail free"" card. I think from an outside perspective it seems that way, since a defendant would be deemed not guilty for their crime, and the assumption is that they can walk free and re-enter society. However, as the lecture and video talked about, the NGRI defense does not mean the defendant is set free. Rather, the defendants are usually sent to a state hospital, and often are in the state hospital for a period equal to the maximum sentence for their most serious offense. Also, in some cases, the defendant would stay in the state psychiatric hospital forever since they cannot leave unless a judge permits and sometimes judges choose to leave a defendant in the state hospital. NGRI  this is something that rarely happens, as the video talked about 1% of felony charges plea NGRI and only a quarter of them are actually deemed NGRI by either a judge or jury. I actually think a NGRI can be beneficial in some cases, because even though state psychiatric hospitals are not perfect at giving PWMI effective treatment, I do think they are better than jails and prisons, and so an individual might actually benefit from pleading NGRI because they will get the psychiatric help they need in a state hospital. "
2156,"I think that it is hard for state hospitals to deal with patient and staff safety, while providing treatment. The video talked about how the facility tried to make treatment more effective by giving patients more freedom, which somewhat backfired because it left staff more vulnerable. As a result, the video shed light on how the safety of nurses are often compromised, which leads them to be attacked. I think this demonstrates how it is hard for state hospitals to address safety, while providing treatment. With that being said, I think things like more training and more staffing can help deal with safety and treatment at the same time. For example, when it comes to more training, if nurses are given mental health training skills, like de-escalation techniques, then they might be less susceptible to being attacked by a patient. I think this kind of training might also make them more effective in treatments when helping PWMI. The lecture also shed light on how majority of patients in state hospitals are forensic patients, so I think some kind of training reflecting on how patients have gone through the criminal justice system would be effective, as a way to learn about how to prevent patients from hurting themselves and staff members."
2157,"I have mixed feelings as doctors using deep brain stimulation as a treatment for depression. On one side of the spectrum, I am not the biggest fan of it, because there are side effects such as brain damage, infection, and death. Additionally, the neurologist in the video was talking about how she is not completely sure of how it works and how area 25 might not be the right place to put the electrodes. Lastly, the video also talked about how this type of treatment is experimental and FDA has not approved it. With that being said, I am open to doctors using this treatment as a last resort. The case example of the lady demonstrates how the lady never felt happy, and for years she tried counseling and drugs and nothing worked. Plus, she had a few suicide attempts because she felt no motivation to live. The deep brain stimulation really worked for her, as the negative feelings she felt were gone and she felt fantastic and did not care that there were electrodes in her brain that made her feel this way. She also talked about even though she did not feel great all the time, she did feel joy, and because she had the capacity to feel joy, she knew how to be happy. I think this case example demonstrates how this treatment can work, and it should be sued as a last resort, because it has some negative effects. "
2158,"I think that the most appropriate role for state hospitals, in relation to the criminal justice system, is to have a role for certain types of forensic inmates. In fact, I think that state hospitals and the criminal justice system should be separate entities that should only work together when dealing with defendants that are incompetent to stand trial or not guilty by reason of insanity. I think that state hospitals should be used for forensic patients that are incompetent to stand trial or not guilty by reason of insanity because these types of patients have not been convicted of a crime. Rather, these types of patients need psychiatric care immediately and state hospitals are the best fit government facility to do so. In the case of incompetence to stand trial, the immediate care is needed to release a defendant back to a judge. In the case of not guilty by reason of insanity, the immediate care is needed to release the defendant back to society. This means that state hospitals would consist of patients that need immediate help with their symptoms and are working towards release, which are very similar to non-forensic patients, such as civil commitment patients, because these types of patients are working towards release as well. In addition to state hospitals addressing immediate psychiatric symptoms, I also think that the treatments in state hospitals should be tailored in a way where patients are taught the skills they need to live successful lives when they are released.   The reason it is important for types of patients working towards release to be in state hospitals is because these patients can reap the benefits of state hospitals, such as how they provide a quiet retreat, are equipped to care for disturbed patients, and can open the door to constructive change. Another benefit, which was highlighted in a study by Rothbard and Kuno (2000), is that patients that have been in hospitals for over five years demonstrate improved life satisfaction and no decrease levels in functioning after discharge. This all shows that patients can benefit from being placed in a state hospital. Our lecture talks about how state hospitals can be very prison like, and so I think that one way to address this for patients in state hospitals is to have state hospitals build relationships with community treatment centers. When state hospitals build relationships with community treatment centers, they learn about the type of care community treatment programs pro"
2159,"Hi Jennifer, I like a point you brought up in your post, which is that those with milder mental health issues can be managed in outpatient care. I really like this notion, especially if outpatient care has a community based treatment emphasis, meaning that outpatient care not only helps PWMI with their symptoms, but also with other aspects of their lives, such as employment. This got me thinking – how does health insurance work when an individual shifts from a state hospital to a outpatient care facility. I found a government article ( https://marketplace.cms.gov/technical-assistance-resources/incarcerated-and-recently-released-consumers.pdf) that sheds light on when an individual is categorized incarcerated or not, which is important because incarcerated individuals apply for Medicaid, which includes mental health services, and individuals that are not incarcerated apply for insurances through the Affordable Care Act. The article talks about how individuals are considered incarcerated when they are in a jail, prison, or mental health facility. That means that parolees and individuals that have not been convicted, such as individuals that are not competent to stand trial, are not considered incarcerated. The reason I wanted to bring this up is because when an individual moves from a state hospital (where they are considered incarcerated) to an outpatient facility (where they are not considered incarcerated), they experience a change in health insurance. It is important that these individuals are on top of applying for health insurance if their eligibility changes, because it can affect their out of pocket payments for care. In these cases, I feel like the criminal justice system and state hospitals should both be responsible in helping PWMI with the change in health insurance, because it might be hard for PWMI to do on their own.  I personally dealt with getting insurance through the state when I was in community college, and it was such a confusing process. I was lucky to know how to navigate the internet to find out the steps and applications, but many do not have this privilege, and so I can only imagine how hard it is if you have symptoms that affect your daily life. I also like the point you brought up about how if state hospitals are limited to only forensic patients, there are populations of patients that are ov"
2160,"Hi Bobbie, I like how you talked about how state hospitals should help individuals with mental illness, and I agree. To be effective in doing this, I think that state hospitals need to always be researching their rehabilitative treatments as a way to make sure they are being effective, and if they are not being effective, they need to be open to making procedural changes to be more effective. One of the videos we watched in lecture talked about how the Fulton hospital did not have group therapy sessions when it first opened, and how this type of treatment is important because it puts PWMI in contact with other PWMI. The video also talked about how the changes happening in Fulton would include group therapy sessions in the future, which is an example of a state hospital that is open to making changes to be more effective. I also like the point you brought up about individuals that have come into contact with the criminal justice system through arrest, and how if these individuals have been incarcerated before and have a mental illness, they should be sent to the state hospital. I have mixed feelings about this. On one side of the spectrum, I see the value of putting them in a state hospital because it prevents them from being released into society until their severe mental health symptoms are dealt with. Our Fisher et al. (2009) article talked about, state hospitals deal with the management of individuals whose behavior is deemed inappropriate and so in some cases no one will accept a patient except a state hospital, and so a state hospital is the best alternative to putting an individual through the criminal justice system. On the other side of the spectrum, I see value in putting them in a community based treatment because of how community based treatments are more holistic. I found a study by Kai and Crosland (2001) that looked at a community based treatment that improved the quality of communication of mental health professionals, which made the individual receiving treatment feel more empowered. This study shows the value of community based treatments, and how state hospitals might not care much about empowerment, since they are more interested in dealing with the severe symptoms that are affecting an individual. Lastly, I really like your point about having a hospital wing in a prison or jail because I talked about that in my own post. I like the idea of having a hospital wing because inmates with psychiatric episodes can be hospitalized on"
2161,"I think the described forms of data sharing are a great start for understanding the link between the criminal justice system, mental health system, and their clients. I like how the video outlined one of the major problems is that 40% of individuals with mental health needs are not in contact with the Department of Mental Health license services, which means that they are not in contact with mental health services in their community. The video talked about that there is a barrier to identifying treatment needs and the issue is reaching out to PWMI so they can be evaluated since many people suffer from a serious mental illness and so not know it. Some solutions the video proposed was targeting people in their first arrest and having information sharing procedures. I like the initiative they took in Washington D.C. jails, where the jail and department of mental health services have an arrangement where someone from the department of mental health is going through jail records so they can link an individual to their psychiatrist. I also like the ethno culturally competent mental health services idea, so that mental health professionals understand how ethnicity and culture influences behavior. Lastly, I like the education component because education is a way to make sure those that do not understand that they need help, understand their mental illness and how they need treatment. I think more can be done to improve these links. I have a background of I.T. and I think there is huge value to having the criminal justice system and mental health system working off one program. Within the program, individuals can have different security permissions so that mental health professionals can have access to detailed mental health records and law enforcement officials can only see basic mental health records. I also think another way to improve the link is to have individuals from the criminal justice system work in the mental health system and vice versa, similar to what was being done in Washington D.C. I think that this will help individuals from different systems understand the work of each system better, and in doing so they can think of more holistic ways to improve the links."
2162,"The CIT trained approach appears different to me from a routine law enforcement encounter because the police officers with CIT training entered the scene with the goal of helping the man, rather than the goal of dealing with the situation in the quickest way possible and moving on. The police officers seemed very calm and were asking a lot of questions, and tried to avoid making assumptions. I think this was effective in not escalating the situation because it seemed like the man in the video was slowly starting to understand the police officers were there to help him. It was apparent the police officers had CIT training because a few weeks ago we learned that police officers without mental illness training are often stressed in these types of situations because they do not know what to expect, however, it seems like these officers had some knowledge about mental illness because they were not stressed and knew how to de-escalate the situation. This encounter also seemed different from a routine law enforcement encounter because the police officers put the girlfriend in touch with a mental health professional (counselor) who came in to intervene and provide services. I think often times in a routine law enforcement encounter, police officers do not do this, for various reasons, such as not knowing what mental health resources to connect an individual with. I think that this CIT training is an effective approach because it the officers were able to help the man and ultimately did not arrest him. The video also talked about how CIT training results in police officers being able to resolve 55% of the calls they get on the scene, and so CIT training can be effective in helping PWMI from avoiding contact with the criminal justice system."
2163,"The video talked about how NAMI was helping 3,500 PWMI inmates sue the Department of Corrections for not properly taking care of PWMI. I think it often takes legal action to change the way PWMI are treated for two main reasons. The first main reason is that I think PWMI either do not have insight into their mental illness or their mental illness inhibits their decision making, and for that reason they cannot defend themselves or advocate for their mental health rights. For example, a man might have schizophrenia and does not receive mental health treatment because he is not hurting himself or others. In this case, the man still needs help even though his symptoms are not severe, however, the man does not even realize he needs help, and so he just deals with his symptoms everyday and does not get better. This demonstrates that there are people out there that need help but do not get it because they cannot advocate for their mental health rights. As a result, PWMI do not have a voice in prisons and jails and it often takes an outside mental health organization, like NAMI, to come in an advocate for the rights of PWMI. The second reason I think it often takes a court order or legal action to change the way PWMI are treated is because  I think staff in prisons and jails are aware that PWMI are not treated properly, however, they are also aware that the prisons and jails do not have enough money or resources to attend to the needs of PWMI, and for that reason they do not take initiative to help PWMI. For example, a lot of treatments are costly and so it is hard for prisons and jails to balance spending money on the needs of PWMI when there are other pressing issues in prisons and jails that need money as well."
2164,"I think the challenges that mental health workers might have to deal with in the correctional environment includes building trust with inmates and safety. While writing my paper this week, I came across an article that talked about how it is hard for inmates to trust mental health workers because the mental health workers are employed by the institution that incarcerated them, such as the prison or jail. The video did not touch on this, however, it did touch on how mental health workers are often seen as inauthentic and this is a reason to why it is hard to mental health workers to build trust and provide treatment. I think this is one challenge mental health workers face when trying to provide therapeutic services to PWMI in a correctional environment. I also think mental health workers deal with safety issues, since this video emphasized that mental health workers do not have to worry about safety in Raven Hall because it is a safe place to work. It seems like other correctional environments worry about safety, and this is a challenge for mental health workers when providing treatment because they have to balance the safety of themselves and their PWMI client. For example, last week we watched a video on a nurse getting attacked in a correctional facility, and how the nurse often did not feel safe and this made it hard for them to provide treatment to PWMI.  I think cross-training with correctional agencies and staff would help because the different staff members would understand the goal and role of each person, and this might help spur ideas on how to work better together to be more effective for the inmate. The video also talked about how people in prisons do not want any more failures so you want to help them reach their goal and so I think cross training can help people realize their role in helping inmates reach their goal."
2165,"I think that there are various essential trainings for mental health and criminal justice actors and that these trainings can benefit PWMI. First, I think that criminal justice actors, like judges and lawyers, should attending mental health training courses yearly to benefit PWMI involved in the criminal justice system. I think that these types of training should cover some topics of training we talked about in lecture, such as understanding mental illness, statutory requirements, police response to calls for service, response options, and bookings. Even though criminal justice actors might not use this type of information in their everyday work, I think that being aware of the process that PWMI go through when they come into contact with the criminal justice system is important. Aside from topics about the process of PWMI go through, topics like stigma, prevalence of mental illness, and common mental health symptoms can be covered so criminal justice actors can understand the statistics regarding mental illness better. I think that if general practicing lawyers and judges attend these trainings, they might also see the benefits of mental health courts and might start being advocates for it. The handout we were given this week on mental health courts talked about the learning objectives of mental health courts and a lot of these objectives benefit PWMI, such as protecting the legal rights of PWMI. The law school I work for gives away Minimum Continuing Legal Education (MCLE) credits to criminal justice actors, such as lawyers, that need the credits to remain in good standing with the bar so they can continue practicing law. In California, individuals need 25 hours of MCLE credits every three years. I think making sure that a proportion of these hours are devoted to mental health would be beneficial to PWMI because lawyers and judges have some kind of knowledge on what PWMI go through when they have mental health symptoms. I have attended one of these talks for MCLE credit and majority of the lawyers are on their laptops and they are not paying attention, so I think it would not be a bad idea to implement some quizzes at the end of the talks to make sure individuals are paying attention to the information that is being presented. Thus, there are ways to have essential training for criminal justice actors to benefit PWMI. Second, I think there should be essential training for correctional personal. The training for correction personal should happe"
2166,"Hi Stephanie, Like everyone else that replied to your discussion post, I think you bring up some really good points to why CIT training should be essential for mental health and criminal justice actors in benefiting PWMI. I like the point you brought up about how CIT training needs to be longer than 40 hours and more frequent. I agree with this notion, as I have attended 40 hour trainings for work, and have found myself wishing that I could have more training so my skills could be improved and more effective. Plus, in additional training, I could get feedback on the skills I have learned from the initial training, and how I can expand on these skills. With that being said, I am a little hesitant in implementing CIT training nationwide, especially for mental health professionals. The first reason I am hesitant is because the Taheri (2016) article we read in week four talked about how there was not enough evidence to conclude that the CIT models reduced office injury during encounters between law enforcement and PWMI. This article also shined light on how officers that received CIT training were more likely to put PWMI in contact with community resources that could help them, rather than arresting them, however, these findings were null and not significant. These findings show that the CIT training is not that effective when looking at it from a research perspective. For that reason, I think we should keep the basic components of CIT trainings, such as disseminating information about PWMI and having role play exercises, but we should also implement additional components to CIT training to make it more effective. For example, adding a component of having law enforcements officials learn about mental health courts might make CIT training more effective. The second reason I am hesitant to implement CIT training is because I think this training would be redundant to the training mental health professionals already receive, since a lot of the training for mental health professionals is focused on de-escalating situations that include PWMI by learning about mental health symptoms and mental health professionals that deal with PWMI clients already know how to do that. Regardless, of the two reasons I am hesitant to implement CIT training, I think CIT training for mental health and criminal justice actors would be beneficial for PWMI. Taheri, S. A. (2016). Do crisis intervention teams reduce arrests and improve officer safety? A systematic review"
2167,"Hi Danielle,  I like how you talked about how you were hesitant to implement CIT training for all mental health and criminal justice actors, and I felt like that too, especially since we learned during week 4 about how some research has demonstrated that CIT training is not effective. I also liked how you talked about how the NAMI training is a good starting place, and I agree. The Parker (2009) article we read this week broke down the NAMI training by going over what the sessions covered, and I noticed that a lot of the sessions covered topics that mental health actors probably already know about, such as treatment of the mental illness. Therefore, I think the NAMI training should cover more topics that would benefit mental health actors. For example, our lecture talked about the importance of training mental health actors on police protocol for use of force and officer expectation of community providers, thus, these kinds of topics could be included in the NAMI training. One aspect of the NAMI training I really liked was how cost-effective it was. CIT training often involves actors and time to get in touch with mental health organizations, and NAMI training is less time-consuming because the sessions focus on the dissemination of information. It would be nice for this information to always be available for professionals, such as through an application on their phone. I couldn’t find a study on the effectiveness of phone applications for mental health workers, but I did find a study that talked about how phone applications regarding information on stroke were mostly used by healthcare workers (Dubey, Amritphale, Sawhney, Amritphale, Dubey, & Pandey, 2014). I think it would not be a bad idea if a similar application is created on the topic of mental health and this application could be downloaded for free by mental health and criminal justice actors so that they can refer to it while at work dealing with a PWMI.  Dubey, D., Amritphale, A., Sawhney, A., Amritphale, N., Dubey, P., & Pandey, A. (2014). Smart phone applications as a source of information on stroke.  Journal of stroke,  16(2), 86."
2168,"I think the diversion efforts in Fairfax were interesting to learn about. They had different approaches to diversion, such as allowing an officer to take a person to a crisis response center, instead of jail, if they think the person's behavior is a result of a mental illness. The video also talked about the mobile crisis team and the peer support specialist, which I think are both important to making sure PWMI are not always criminalized. I think these diversion programs focus on the non-violent offender because that I feel that the programs think they will getter results if they focus on non-violent offenders, and this assumption is probably based on the notion that the individuals think that non-violent offenders are more susceptible to treatment. In addition to that, individuals also probably think it is easier and less costly to treat non-violent offenders. I think that these programs should also focus on violent offenders because they deserve treatment as well. I can see the fear of taking a violent offender to a crisis response center because the violent offender might be released back into the streets after they are evaluated at the crisis response center. Then if the individual becomes violent again, the crisis response center becomes responsible because they let the violent offender back on the street. However, I think that violent offenders should not be ignored and he or she should receive the benefits of diversion programs as well. For example, I think a violent offender would benefit from having a peer support specialist help them with their violent tendencies, and is a better approach than just incarcerating a violent offender who would just be placed in jail and probably would not receive any treatment. "
2169,"I think the hurdles are the same when it comes to criminal justice and mental health agencies implementing evidence-based practices. I think one of the main hurdles both agencies face is having the ability to evaluate current practices or other types of practices they want to implement to make sure they are evidence-based. As the video talked about, to implement evidence-based practices, the scientific community first needs to look at the number of studies for that practice, the quality of the studies regarding that practice, and whether experts agree on whether the practice works. This kind of testing involves time, and so I think the criminal justice and mental health agencies, which are both under-staffed in most instances, face the obstacle of finding the people to evaluate practices and implement them in a way that is evidence-based. If these practices are implemented, I feel that that in many cases it requires more staffing because most of the evidence-based practices we learned about this week require several components, such as a family component and employment components. The lecture also talked about how one of the suggestions for evidence-based practices is assertive community treatment, which includes services like case management and availability of 24 hour services. Once again, I think the criminal justice and mental health agencies have trouble implementing these services because they do not have the funds to staff individuals for the additional services needed to have the evidence-based practices available for PWMI.  "
2170,"I think that an integrated mental health and substance abuse model would change the way the criminal justice system works with individuals with co-occurring disorders immensely. I think this kind of model would encourage criminal justice staff to screen individuals that enter prisons and jails for both mental disorders and substance abuse disorders, and to do this as soon as possible, because as the video talked about, early identification is important for early intervention. I also think that individuals that have gone through the integrated model and then find themselves in contact with the criminal justice system would be vocal about how their substance abuse and mental illness were both inhibiting their decision-making, rather than being quiet and not being aware of the presence of a substance abuse disorder and mental disorder. I also think that the criminal justice system would integrate the treatments PWMI receive in jails and prisons, and add additional treatment components, such as a family plan component, which the integrated model has. In doing so, the justice system should cross train staff, just like what was done in Louisiana to LITS specialists. Lastly, the video talked about having PWMI be active participants in writing a treatment plan and I think that the criminal justice system could benefit from this by having PWMI receive an integrated treatment plan in one place, rather than separately attending to their mental health needs and substance abuse needs."
2171,"Peer mentoring might be helpful in addressing stigma of mental illness by making individuals feel that they are not alone in the symptoms they feel. Thus, peer mentoring can combat the self stigma that individuals have about themselves, meaning it can make individuals not feel ashamed of having a mental illness, and rather empowered because through peer mentoring they will come to the realization that others have mental illness like them. The video made me realize that peer mentoring is a bidirectional relationship. The mentors talked about how they benefited from peer mentoring because they realized that they were not the only ones that have mental health problems and it gave them insight into their own problems. This meant that the mentors that were supposed to be guiding the individuals being mentored felt positively about peer mentoring because they felt less stigmatized about having a mental disorder because the individual they were mentoring were going through similar mental health symptoms. The individuals being mentored also benefited because they got to do things like make goals with their mentors, and these kind of things not only helped them with combating their mental disorder, but also made them realize that the symptoms they are experiencing are normal and that their mentor is here to guide them and help them through their treatment. For example, someone in the video talked about how the mentor program encouraged her to start a course to engage with other people and make friends. This example demonstrates how peer mentoring addresses stigma by making individuals come to the realization that they are not alone in the issues they go through and how they should not feel shameful for engaging in treatment or normal activities."
2172,"The paper by Crowley and Kirschner (2015) reading this week highlighted six recommendations from the American College of Physicians (ACP) regarding advocacy, research, and practice of mental health and these recommendations can affect PWMI in the criminal justice system. The first recommendation from the ACP is that behavioral health care should be integrated into primary care. That means that anytime a PWMI comes into contact with primary care services, whether it be in jail or court, they should received behavioral health services and anytime they come into contact with behavioral health services, they should come into contact with primary care services. I found a study by Fickenscher, Lapidus, Silk-Walker, and Becker (2001) that talked about how majority of women inmates in a county jail had physical problems that were due to their history of physical abuse or heroin use prior to arrest. This demonstrates the high prevalence of physical problems that individuals in the criminal justice system face, and how including behavioral health care with their primary care would address both their physical and mental health needs. It would not only address both needs, but provide integrated care. For example, a women that has physical problems due to heroin use might also have substance abuse problems, and their care can involve treatment that combats both issues. One example of a treatment I can think of is cognitive therapy that makes the individual realize that substance abuse can hurt their body and medications for their health problems. This example of integrated care addresses involvement, identification, treatment, and outcome of PWMI in the criminal justice system because at each one of these steps, the individual's physical and mental health care needs are both being addressed, which positively affects their outcomes. The Munetz and Teller (2004) article talks about post-arrest diversion programs and how the court has mental health workers asses individuals in jail or at court for any mental disorders. This is a great example of where the integration of behavioral health and primary health can also happen so that the mental and physical needs of PWMI are identifies, rather than just mental health needs. Thus, integrated care that addresses the physical and mental needs of PWMI in the criminal justice system can positively affect PWMI.  The second recommendation from the ACP is that public and private health insurances, policy makers, and health"
2173,"Hi Sayla, I really like the point you brought up regarding how integration of primary care and behavioral care helps individuals get identified and receive the treatment they need. I like this point because I agree that integrated care is crucial to getting a holistic picture of an individual’s physical and mental health needs, and how identifying these needs will allow the criminal justice system to provide effective and efficient evidence-based treatments. When do you think this type of integrated care should occur for PWMI that have come into contact in the criminal justice system? I think this integrated care should happen when PWMI are being onboarded to a jail or prison. When I was writing my paper, I was shocked to learn that only 58% of juvenile facilities reported that they evaluated the mental health needs of all youth that entered their juvenile facilities (Hockenberry, Wachter, & Sladky, 2016). This means that not all youth were being evaluated as they entered juvenile facilities, which I think is problematic because evaluations should be happening as soon as possible so that worsening of symptoms can be prevented. I think that integrated care needs to be mandated in all criminal justice facilities, including jails and prisons, and this care should happen when an individual is onboarded so that the physical and mental health needs of individuals in the criminal justice system are identified right away. Not only that, but I think that individuals in the criminal justice system should receive integrated care on a yearly basis, regardless of whether they demonstrate symptoms, because one might develop physical and mental health problems while in a jail or prison. For example, an individual who had no mental health symptoms or physical problems might be put in isolation 6 months into their sentence, and as a result of this they develop back problems and suicidal ideations. If integrated care is provided every year, it can identify physical and mental problems that arise among inmates. I also think the behavioral aspect of integrated care should be conducted by a mental health professional. Through my paper, I also discovered not all youth in juvenile facilities were being evaluated by mental health professionals, as more than 36% of youth were not being evaluated by someone with a mental health background (Hockenberry, Wachter, and Sladky, 2016). This means that not only should integrated care be mandated, but mental health professio"
2174,"Hi Karen, I think you bring up an interesting point about sharing a diagnosis an individual in the criminal justice system receives with friends and family of the individual. I like this suggestion, however, I do have mixed feelings about this. On one side of the spectrum, a lot of treatment models we learned this quarter had a family component, and that is what made the treatment model effective and efficient. Therefore, I do see value with sharing a physical health and mental health diagnosis with friends and family, so that the friends and family can be active participants in the treatment of the individual. On the other side of the spectrum, I feel like this should only happen if an individual in the criminal justice system wants to share information about their physical and mental health. Our Harvey and Gumport (2015) reading talked about how participants in a study felt that they needed to conceal their diagnosis because 46% of them experienced discrimination from friends and 43% experienced discrimination from family members. That means that there are individuals out there that share their diagnosis and experience a negative reaction, which can often be a reason for why they do not seek treatment. If an individual does not want to share this information, I think they should receive peer mentoring. The video we watched this week on peer mentoring demonstrated that putting PWMI in touch with other PWMI helped reduce the stigma they had about their diagnosis. If this type of peer mentoring happens at the criminal justice level, then a PWMI might be more open to sharing the physical and mental health needs with their friends and family, because they will see value in sharing that type of information and will not feel any embarrassment. I agree when you bring up the point about how stigma needs to be reduced, especially when it comes to medical professionals and their stigma towards substance abuse problems. I think that trainings regarding PWMI in the criminal justice system can combat this issue of stigma, which can also be beneficial towards integrated care because professionals will begin to see the value of addressing physical and mental health needs together."
2175," I believe what could have prevented Timothy Souders death in prison is if he was transfer to a mental facility or if he was evaluated from a mental health care specialist either a psychologist, psychiatrist or medical doctor. It was stated in the 60 minutes video that Timothy suffered from depression and anxiety. His mother stated that he lost a sense of reality as he spent ""some nights naked and running around the house thinking he was fighting off dragons."" The psychiatrist was put on a seven-week leave while Souders was in prison and there was no other psychiatrist on-site to evaluate him. This was a significant issue considering the fact that most prison employees do not know how to properly care for mentally ill inmates. It has been proven in precedent cases such as in the Jeffrey Clark case that most have been neglected and died from starvation or dehydration.  In jail, Souders attempted to commit suicide and instead of being evaulate he was placed in solitude and restraints. The director of the prison facility stated that Souders was placed in restraints but not for the purpose of punishment but for the protection of the prisoners and others. Video surveillance shows that Souders was placed in these restraints for 12-17 hours a day. Leaving him with little time to be released from the restraints. Aside from that prison employees failed to seek medical attention when they noticed that Souders refuse water knowing it was 100 degrees in the prison cell. It’s rational that Souders became ""delusional"" from the heat in the cell.  Overall, Souders human rights were deprived. Although prison inmates are there to “serve time” I strongly believe it's critical to properly evaluate them for mental illness. It was demonstrated that 1 in 4 individuals have been diagnosed with mental illness and 6% of the population has some serious form of mental illness. Therefore, it is vital for those who work in the criminal/social justice to treat their inmates equally by properly evaluating the individual on a case to case basis.  "
2176," The perceptions of how mental patients should be care for has changed throughout the years. Non-medical individuals' ideal of treatment for those with mental illness was by doing procedures or placing patients into asylums. During Pre-Civilization era tribal groups assume that individuals suffering from mental illness were due to evil spirits. In Ancient civilization, Hippocrates argued that mentally ill patients should be care and treated for.  However, in the Middle Ages, millions of innocent individuals who were mentally ill were tortured and murdered.  In the early 1950s, people were lobotomized and now in days mental illness is becoming more acceptable, however, those who do not have a medical occupation often lack the proper care for mental patients."
2177," No, I don’t think the benefits of a national registry of mentally ill persons outweigh the costs. We can’t assume who is mentally ill or severely violent. Statistics demonstrated that out of 10,000 individuals only 500 are possibly claim as violent. California came out with an Armed Prohibited Persons System database (APPS) which aims to confiscate guns from three types of people: those who are criminals, those who have a history of violence and those who are mentally ill. In “The Truth About Mental Illness And Guns” it was stated that the news is so quick to find someone to blame behind a mass shooting especially those who are mentally ill. Lynette was forced into a 51/50 hold in which she was involuntarily committed to a hospital. She was diagnosed with anxiety but claims made about her stated that she wanted to drive off a cliff.  She stated this was false. Authorities proceeded into taking away her and her husband firearms from their home. Lynette expressed how she felt embarrassed because her neighbors watched what happened. I myself, have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety but that doesn’t mean I will harm someone. There a negative stigma that surrounds those who are perceived as mentally ill and I do not think it fair to assume that those who are mentally ill will harm themselves or others. Overall, I believe the national registry causes more harm than good."
2178," I believe the most important problem to fix in regards to deinstitutionalization is properly evaluating mentally ill patients prior to releasing them from institutions. The issue with deinstitutionalization is that there was little funding and many who were released from institutions were severely mentally ill. Which means that they wouldn’t be a great fit for community centers. In the Ted Talk, it was also discussed that during the deinstitutionalization movement, many people had the Not In My Backyard (N.I.M.B.Y) mentality. This made it more difficult for those who were mentally ill to fit in with society. Many stated that they believe in helping those who were mentally ill as long as those individuals weren't placed in housing in their area or employed in the same vicinity as them. "
2179," Throughout the centuries, society has view mental illness as either a problem or something evil and demonic. I believe that our willingness to consider them full-fledged members of society is by having them become “normalized.” Either through acts of procedures, hypnosis, placing them in institutions or having them deinstitutionalized. The different views throughout the centuries on mental illness have varied. Now in days, it almost seem like we create a sense of fear amongst those who mentally ill and gun violence. Overall, as Slate et al. (2013) has stated there have been societal shifts on how to care and control for mentally ill patients but there still a negative stigma that is attached to those who are considered mentally ill. "
2180,"Hi Jennifer,  Interesting discussion post. I absolutely agree that society has yet to provide mentally ill patients with proper treatment. Throughout the centuries there have been societal shifts. During the early 1940s-1950s' lobotomies were fairly common to help correct mental illness. However, cases such as Rosemary Kennedy depicts that lobotomies were dangerous procedures. Then medication such as Thorazine was used to help treat symptoms of mental illness. However, it was later banned in the 1970s'.  Now in days, we tend to shed a negative light on the mentally ill in regards to gun violence. Statistics demonstrated that only 3-5% are severely violent. We have also considered having registry lists and involuntary/voluntary civil commitment."
2181,"Hi Bethannie,  Interesting discussion post. I appreciate you stating that it is important to continue to educate our society on mental illness. A lot of the times what we know about mental illness comes from social media or the news and I think that's not a good judgment to have because there are people who are mentally ill but live functional lives. Such as I have been diagnosed with GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) and when I was younger I sometimes feared telling people I have that because I didn't want to be label as ""mentally ill"" or disabled. I have come to learn that I can still live a normal life I just have a few more struggles compare to other people that from time to time needs to be accommodated. At the moment, I work at a middle school and I provide some form of counseling to my students. It makes me happy that now in days we have more resources to help our community. Overall, there continues to be a negative stigma that surrounds the mental health care community but with the right education and rise of awareness I believe we can be on the right track. "
2182,"A president can be effective in bringing about an end to stigma of mental illness by educating and informing Americans about mental health, by encouraging others to treat each other with equality and by bringing awareness and empowerment instead of shame and embarrassment."
2183,"In the video, President Obama discussed about there are too many Americans who are suffering from mental illness but aren't seeking help because there's a negative stigma. A vast majority of individuals who have mental illness may feel isolated or a burden to their loved ones. Overall, it's important to advocate that mental health is just as important as one physical health."
2184,"Reducing benefits for mental health care shows the lack of understanding, empathy and equality policymakers have on mental health versus other health care. It shows that mental illness isn't seen as a priority. Randy Tate, CEO of North Care stated that if these cuts do happen it means we are reducing the services they can be provided to patients.  It was stated that 35% of North Care patients are on Medicaid and with cuts, they wouldn't have the money to pay their psychiatrists or prescribers.  It almost seems that we are furthering isolating and excluding those with mental illness. By making it seem that their illness is not real or it is not our problem to care for as a society. It also places a negative stigma in regards to social media and newscasts that patients with mental illness are violent or incompetent. This makes it difficult for those who struggle with mental illness as they are less likely to seek help. Just recently, on October 10th we had Mental Health day to bring awareness about mental illness. "
2185,"The primary cause of homelessness among veterans is due to substance abuse, medical issues, mental illness and lack of social support (Slate et. al, 2013). What I would recommend for mental health treatment for active military as well as veterans is having availability to mental health care services. Only 8% can be claimed as a veteran and it was discussed that veterans asking for help should be evaluated within 24 hours. However, this is typically not true. Most Veterans aren't evaluated until three months later (Slate et. al, 2013). When President Obama was in office he signed to employed more mental health care professionals for VA.  However, even this hasn't seemed to diffuse the problem. I believe cognitive behavioral therapy, support groups, and nonpharmacological treatment would benefit as a vast majority of them suffer from PTSD. I don't fully believe by medicating them it would make it better such as what Chris suggested from the video because a lot of them have already been on psychiatric drugs while in the army. "
2186,"I don't believe society should mandate treatment but I do believe that there should be a choice whether or not to seek treatment.  Those who fail to seek treatment may have Anosognosia which refers to a lack of insight into their illness. It was demonstrated that 40-90% of patients with mental illness suffer from this. There are individuals who want to avoid being diagnosed with mental illness because of prejudice and labeling (Slate et. al, 2013). I think it's up to family members/loved ones or the individuals to want to seek treatment. I don't think it would be beneficial to mandate treatment but I do think it would be beneficial to advocate and eliminate any negative stigma surrounding mental illness."
2187," I think it's important to have an educational curriculum that discusses about mental illness. If we discuss the truth about other health illnesses why shouldn't we apply it to mental illness? Students should have the right to be taught about bipolar disorder, depression, schizophrenia, anxiety, etc. This will allow them to grasp a better understanding of how certain people function. We’re not all built the same and I think that is the main issue we have in our society.  We often try to normalize how we behave and think but we fail to realize why certain people function differently. It was discussed that there are common misconceptions about individuals with mental illness such as they are violent and should be feared, they are rebellious and have a childlike perception of the world (Rusch et. Al, 2005). Not only does this create a negative stigma surrounding mental illness but it becomes difficult for those to seek treatment.  It was demonstrated that those suffering from mental illness are perceived as responsible for causing their illness (Rusch et. Al, 2005). When I was in middle school I didn’t realize anxiety or depression existed because there was no awareness around it. Even in the Hispanic culture, I had members within my family tell me ""that's not real. It's all in your head."" Although there some truth to it the mind is a very powerful thing and who can tell us to ""quit"" thinking about certain things. It's not that simple. When my uncle was diagnosed with cancer and other tragic events that took place in my family followed, I felt hopeless and sad but I had no idea at the time that I had generalized anxiety. I often felt like my illness wasn't valid as many people I have spoken to in the past stated that mental illness has no physical side effects therefore, it's not real. Their so much negative stigma that surrounds mental illness especially because “it's invisible” and this makes it easier for those who suffered from it to become isolated. From the outside, I appeared healthy and normal but from the inside, I felt like I was losing a fight with my inner demons. We hear about suicide cases especially amongst minors and its upsetting at times there is little to no empathy surrounding the issue. I have come to learn that I’m not an outcast but instead, someone who’s brain processes differently.  As someone who works in the education system what I can say is throughout the ye"
2188,"Hi Jennifer,  Interesting discussion post! I absolutely agree that both, mental and physical illnesses are medical conditions. I love the fact that you suggested having a guest speaker who suffers from mental illness to present in front of a class. I feel like there would be more of a personal connection as that individual has specifically undergoe through certain obstacles compare to those without mental illness. I work at a middle school and what I can say is more schools are incorporating awareness of mental illness. I just feel now its more of a private matter. Such as those who visit counselors talk privately as they want to avoid any stigma. I hope one day we can discuss more openly. During the summer, I taught at a summer program and the curriculum I had was Issues and Choices. I love that they had this curriculum as it allowed students to feel like they had a safe space to talk about personal issues happening at home or at school  (bullying, death, discrimination, stress, identity, and assumptions) and it made them feel like their not alone. Overall, I believe it's important for our youth to be taught about mental illness especially because during adolescence most are exposed to tragic events."
2189,"Hi Asia,  Interesting discussion post. I agree with you in regards to stigma being detrimental to our society and how patients with mental illness should be treated equally and with sympathy. As you stated, they shouldn't be punished or shamed for being ""different."" Instead, we should bring awareness and find ways to help them.  I believe by educating our youth on this issue we can bring inclusion of certain groups and reduce and possibly eliminate stigma. "
2190," The concepts of specificity and sensitivity would apply to decisions about civil commitment because it discusses about tests being imperfect. The video discusses about individuals testing positive or negative for certain types of diseases. There are two tests: sensitivity and specificity. It was said that tests vary depending on whether the test is made to follow more on sensitivity or specificity. Meaning there a positivity for error. In regards to the decisions surrounding civil commitment if an individual test for false positive or false negative, it can be problematic. If the person has a false positive it can be problematic in a way that the individual is being placed under scrutiny and supervision when they don’t necessarily need it. Whereas, with false-negative, the issue lies that the individual is not predicted to have a problem but the individual may be a danger to themselves or others."
2191,"I believe placing sex offenders into involuntary commitment is unnecessary, coercive and if anything it stigmatizes them. Although their acts were not morally accurate I do believe if they serve their time and have a low risk of reoffending they deserve a chance to reintegrate into society. Studies have demonstrated that sex offenders are often discriminated against after serving their time in prison. I think it's also important to keep in mind that some sex offenders are label and register due to minor offenses such as urinating in public or being a minor and sexting another minor. Overall the outcomes for sex offenders are negative as they struggle finding housing and employment. If these offenders were severely violent I think my decision would vary."
2192," I would believe outpatient commitment to be the larger reach of state authority into individual liberty. With outpatient commitment, it was stated that it can be coercive, anti-therapeutic, stigmatizing, forced medical compliance and disempowering. "
2193," I believe the most appropriate measure of success for these forms of treatment for the individual is providing adequate mental health care services. Government law states that they will provide these services however, it is not a guarantee due to lack of funding. I believe this to be the main concern as patients should be given the proper treatment for their illness. Reflecting back to the pros and cons of inpatient and outpatient involuntary commitment with outpatient it is proven that individuals must be treated without their consent as it prevents them from harming themselves or others but it was also proven to be coercive and unconstitutional (Slate et. Al, 2013). With outpatient commitment, there are controversial issues and concerns as to how it deprives an individual of their liberty, how it is stigmatizing and how it is used as a form of social control (Swanson et. Al, 2009). However, in a North Carolina study when individuals were placed under outpatient commitment for 6 months or longer it was demonstrated that patients received more mental health services, an increase in quality of life and medication compliance (Swanson et. Al, 2009). With inpatient commitment, it’s shown that the individual is given an option, however, the con to this is that the individual may appear normal but instead poses as a possible threat or danger to others and yet they are not seeking treatment. Legislatures then came up with the Grave disability standard in which civil commitment is supported if an individual poses a danger of physical harm and is incapable of taking care of themselves such as providing necessities (Swanson et. Al, 2009).  The textbook states individuals behind mass murders and homicides such as Seung-Hui Cho, Jared Lee  Loughner and Andrew Goldstein which motivated New York State to come up with Kendra Law fail to seek or having a continuation of mental health care treatment. Due to the massacre that occurred at Virginia Tech in 2007, legislatures have spent 42 million to increase CSB services and (CIT) Crisis intervention teams programs (Slate et. Al, 2013). However, there were several factors that prevente"
2194," Hi Caroline,  Interesting discussion post. You have a lot of valid points. I like how you stated in regards to inpatient commitment if an individual is transferred to a different facility that individual may feel like they are in troubled often creating a negative environment. Support is important and I believe the system should do a better job to support those with mental illness instead of criminalizing them. I believe the appropriate measure for both society and individuals is having proper funding for mental health care services. It was demonstrated that a vast majority of patients often lack resources for counseling and medication. Although the law has established on providing individuals with services it is not a guarantee (Module 3.3). In California, an outpatient commitment law was passed but the government had no money and prohibited other counties from shifting resources from other mental health care programs (Slate et. al, 2013).  In other states, it was shown that little planning was done on what community services needed for mentally ill patients. Overall, I strongly believe the main issue in the health care system lies with its allocation."
2195,"Hi Sayla,  Interesting discussion post. I love how you stated that less coercive measures are needed to increase patient satisfaction in treatment and reduction in stigma.  Additional funding is needed for both outpatient and inpatient commitment.  In a survey that evaluated 500 mental health professionals in Florida, it was demonstrated that one-third of respondents did not pursue outpatient commitment because of the lack of services and insufficient infrastructure (Slate et. al, 2013). Results also show that 22% of patients have considered outpatient commitment but choose not to go forward due to the inability to enforce compliance and a lack of services (Slate et. al, 2013).  Overall, funding is needed to provide a safer and healthier community. "
2196,"After reading all of this week course readings I believe both inpatient and outpatient commitment to be a violation of individual liberty as with inpatient commitment individuals are bound to be evaluated because they may pose a risk to themselves or others and with outpatient individuals, it is shown that medication management and individual or group therapy sessions are needed, however, we're not completely sure if this individual poses a risk as it is seen as more of a preventive. Yet with outpatient commitment, the patient is forced to comply with any suggested treatment plan. Inpatient civil commitment also focuses on four social goals which are providing care and treatment for those who require it, preventing individuals from harming themselves, protecting and relieving society from providing care for patient needs (Slate et. al, 2013). I think the keyword ""relieves"" society from providing care is misconstruing because it should be up to society to help one another. If we do it in regard to other issues why can't it be applied to the mental health care system? So I think both are a violation of individual liberty and consider involuntary."
2197,"I believe the prosecution and pretrial stage of the criminal process described in the video would seem to be the most difficult for patients with mental illness to navigate through because they have to make appearances and attend preliminary hearings. In preliminary hearings, the judge would look at the evidence to determine if the accused should be indicted or released. If a felony is involved then a grand jury hearing would take place. Lastly, in this process is the arraignment in which the accused will be informed of the charges being pressed against them. I believe this process to be the most difficult amongst any individual especially on patients with mental illness because they may lack the competency to understand the law, legal terminology and charges being pressed against them. Also, they may not be aware of their constitutional rights such as having an attorney present. This can overall, affect the outcome of their sentencing."
2198,"Throughout the past few years, there have been alignments made on public safety such as California Prop 47 and Prop 57. Prop 47 focuses on redefining property and drug offenses to misdemeanors and having prior records clear up and Prop 57 focuses on an early release for non-violent and non-serious offenders. The potential challenge that may arise for patients with mental illness is the lack of funding in regards to mental health.  In the video ""Cutting California Prison Sizes Leads To More Problems"" it was discussed that counties couldn't afford to pay prison staff members due to the lack of fundings in states. As a result of this, many facilities were forced to close certain parts of the wing/cells within the prison facility. Another challenge is that many inmates are signed to be released early this can jeopardize the safety of the community. The benefits to these alignments are that it came from a result of reducing the prison population as overcrowding became an issue and it also was a result of poor health conditions of inmates. Overall, California corrections shifting the responsibility for a large number of felons from state to local jurisdictions can detrimentally affect the safety of the public if the state lacks the proper funding. "
2199,"I think it is only ""fair"" for police officers to serve as first responders to situations involving individuals with mental illness if they are certified and properly trained to handle crisis situations such as CIT (Crisis intervention Team) officers. Most officers who enroll in the police academy only receive just a few hours of training regarding crisis situations with a mentally ill individual and most have even preferred the role of crime fighters rather than service providers. CIT officers are known to try to de-escalate situations where the individual may become violent. They are often trained to be calm and empathize with family members and individuals with mental illness. According to Slate et. al (2013), individuals who suffer from mental illness are four times more likely to be killed by an officer. In the video we watched, Treatment Gaps Endangering Cops, Mentally Ill they discussed a case about Brenda Williams who suffered from schizophrenia and was shot by police officials when she ran at them with a knife. Her daughter was distraught and upset with how police officials handle the situation. Effective communication skills have been proven to resolve police encounters with individuals with mental illnesses (Slate et. al, 2013). It was demonstrated that officers who receive inadequate training with individuals with mental illness were left unprepared and often contribute to criminalizing them(Slate et. al, 2013). Overall, adequate training can help avoid miscommunication and possibly save an individual life. "
2200,"I believe CIT (crisis intervention team) and stigma are related by reducing the arrests of an individual suffering from mental illness, providing awareness and educating the public on mental illness, allowing citizens to have access to mental healthcare resources and reducing any negative stigma (Slate et. al, 2013).  The textbook also specifies the use of ""people"" as a way of including everyone. CIT focuses on changing the perceptions of American individuals by stating it is far more than training and handling crisis situations but it acts as a way of inclusion of societal members, bringing safety throughout the community and bringing empathy within our criminal justice system.  The most common reason for dispatching CIT officers is due to suicidal ideation of mentally ill individuals. With CIT officers they allow individuals with mental illness to have a voice and input in there decision (Slate et. al, 2013). Therefore, treating them as human beings instead of as criminals.  Overall, by reducing a negative stigma surrounding mental illness we can help save lives without using excessive force."
2201," I believe the use of CIT (Crisis Intervention Teams) have been proven effective. Studies have demonstrated that the options police officers typically have when encountering an individual with mental illness are making an arrest, having them civilly committed or involuntarily hospitalized or doing nothing (Slate et. Al, 2013). In a systematic review conducted by Taheri (2014), it was stated that CIT originated from Memphis and was brought as a way of reducing negative stigma placed on mentally ill individuals, reducing arrests and lastly, to help navigate them to proper health care resources. It was demonstrated that individuals suffering from mental illness were three times more likely to be placed in a jail or prison without having adequate health care (Taheri, 2014). In a study conducted by Borum et. Al (1998) it was estimated that on average police officers had six encounters per month with individuals with mental illness (Slate et. Al, 2003).  It has become fairly common for police officials to handle crisis situations involving mentally ill individuals. However, many do not have adequate training (Slate et. Al,2013). What I would suggest regarding the continuing use of the CIT model for individuals with mental illness is enforcing it instead of having it as an optional training. I believe all police officers should be certified and properly trained in crisis situations. This can prevent injury amongst civilians and officers, it would help build a better understanding of mental health, it can build effective communication skills and help build empathy towards family members or individuals with mental illness (Slate et. al, 2013). It was demonstrated when officers lack adequate training in regards to crisis situations involving mentally ill individuals they felt less confident in their decision-making ability and would normally make arrests (Slate et. Al, 2013). In another study conducted by Greenberg (2001) which focuses on the training curriculum on police academies, it was demonstrated that the average training focus towards mentally ill individuals is four hours (Slate et. Al, 2013). This comes to show those police officers did not have adequate training in handling crisis situations.  Another suggestion that was listed in Taheri's findings is we should have a clearer understanding of what makes a CIT situation that way there are fewer calls for non-CIT officers and the resou"
2202,"Hi Gabriela,  Interesting discussion post. I absolutely agree with your thought of opinion. As Taheri (2003) stated, evaluations were limited when it came to CIT and very few mentioned where these programs were being implemented.  It was also discussed that due to the mix of findings from several studies, this topic should be further examined. There were no clear findings on whether or not arrests and force by police officials were reduced. I also appreciate your input about your cousin's experience. I have a friend who is an officer and is employed through LAPD. He told me that it is also rare to used CIT as he assumes most dispatch calls are due to violent civilians rather than mentally ill individuals. I believe bringing awareness of CIT programs would benefit both civilians and officers. I also believe that CIT should be taught at police academies. I think officers should be certified and trained to handle a crisis situation."
2203,(2016)*
2204,"Hi Lisa,  Interesting discussion post! I would also support the continued use of the CIT model. However, I do believe their needs to be improvements made. Taheri (2016) stated that the CIT model lacks sufficient evidence for its success due to the findings of a null effect. In certain studies, it was demonstrated that the use of force and arrests amongst civilians increased. However, in other studies, it stated the opposite. Do you believe police officers should be require to follow the CIT model or do you believe it should be optional? In my initial post, I stated that I would like the CIT model to be a mandatory training as I believe it may build a rapport with civilians and save lives. "
2205,"I  believe for a person with mental illness to be arrested and jailed more than 100 times especially for minor offenses shows a lack of understanding the criminal justice system has on PWMI such as its emphasis it structures on punishment rather than on treatment.  I believe instead of treating those individuals we are falling towards negative stereotypes and stigma. The video states that jails have become the new asylums and I agree with that statement.  The 60 minutes documentary was filmed in Chicago at Cook County Department of Corrections.  As the facility sheriff, Tom stated, we lack the proper resources to care for these individuals and our mentality shows a contradicting perspective that we're not okay with individuals being placed in asylums yet we are okay with having them in overcrowded prison facilities. There are 2,500 inmates who are mentally ill and fifteen inmates were classified as having a severe mental illness. Overall, the inmates held in these facilities aren't being treated humanely instead they are treated as if they were normal and that's not okay. I could imagine that some of them feel confused, depressed and hopeless.  They may constantly feel like they are going through the same cycle."
2206,"Three indicators I feel jails should measure about mental illness is whether or not the patient has previously been diagnosed with a mental illness, what kind of services should be provided for them and are proper evaluations being conducted to help improve the treatment for mental health care patients. I find these indicators to be important because feedback is needed from inmates and employees to help improve the quality of life in prison facilities. We need to ensure the procedures/protocols that are being done are safe and efficient and aren't violating the inmate's rights as well as causing any psychological, physical or emotional harm. "
2207,"I would also say another indicator is having a way to measure what methods are typically used in prison facilities for mentally ill individuals. Such as in various facilities many rely on solitude, resistant chains, and beatings. So I find it important to evaluate what form of behavior/action causes someone to be in a situation like that. "
2208,"I believe it varies on where an inmate is incarcerated but overall, I feel like jail inmates have a fair amount of rights.  They are protected by the 8th amendment which prohibits against cruel and unusual punishment. Inmates also have a right to treatment due to Estelle V. Gamble (1976). They also have freedom of speech and religion. They are able to communicate with people from the outside as long as it's not inappropriate. Prisons aren't allowed to discriminate inmates based on gender, sexual orientation, race, etc. However, I do believe there are some rights that are lacking or could be improved such as providing inmates with a safe and sanitary cell, caring about their physical and mental health and ensuring inmates aren't sexually/harassed by prison facilities employees or by other inmates."
2209,"I believe medications are the most common form of treatment for individuals with mental illness in jails because it acts as a sedative and form of control.  Prison facilities don't want to focus on evaluations, group or individual therapy sessions as it is more time-consuming and requires a variety of steps. Rather they focus their goal on compliance and medication has a quicker process of accomplishing that. Prisons also provide psychotropic medication however, the issue with this form of medication is that it temporary resolves mental health illness as it is short-term recovery rather than long-term. Overall, the impact of using medication to help treat mental illness amongst prison inmates can be a great concern as there are possibilities that inmates can develop substance abuse and addiction."
2210," The prison and jail populations have quadrupled over the past two decades (Slate et. al, 2013).  In a 2001 state report, San Francisco jail officials stated that a vast number of inmates requiring mental health treatment had increased to 77% in the past decade and moving forward to 2005, Sheriff Baca from LAPD stated he runs the ""biggest mental hospital in the country"" (Torrey et. al, 2010). The use of jails for individuals who suffer from a serious mental illness is inappropriate due to a lack of funding, provision of treatment and care. According to Slate et. al (2013), it was demonstrated that jails deal with inmates who are at their sickest. Individuals who may have been off their medication, intoxicated or are in a crisis situation. Jails are considered more problematic than prisons for mentally ill individuals in a way that inmates are confined to a small space and are there for the short term.  Prisons are relatively known for being more stable and less chaotic (Slate et. al, 2013). Whereas, jails are known as ""people-processing institutions"" as they are waiting for their sentence and there a rapid turnover. This can negatively impact the quality of life mentally ill patients have because they are often being leave treated like other inmates. In regards to the realignment policy changes that have been implemented in California such as Prop 47 and Prop 57, it was used as a form of reducing prison populations and improving poor health conditions. However, the realignment policy changes shifted its financial costs from the state level to local county jails. Prop 47 aimed to focus on setting drug and property offenses to misdemeanors and Prop 57 focused on an early release for non-violent and non-serious offenders (Lecture 4-2). These changes help inmates with a clean record to find employment and housing. In regards to architectural constraints, jails spaces are smaller, underfunded and understaffed compared to state prisons (Slate et. al, 2013). This can be perceived as a problematic issue as jails don't have enough space due to overcrowding facilities or the fact that mentally ill patients can easily become exposed to neglect and abuse from prison employees/inmates.   The experience of patients with mental illness in California jails is affected by justice change in a way that they are lacking the proper treatment and support.  Operational restraints in jails can be due to sho"
2211,"Hi Robert,  Interesting discussion post. I absolutely agree with regards to your opinion on government funding should be spent on psychiatric care. Such as in a study conducted by Torey et. al (2010) it was demonstrated that individuals who suffered from a severe mental illness had 10 times more chances of finding a psychiatric bed in 1955 than in 2004. In a Los Angeles county jail facility, it was reported that 90% of those who were mentally ill had a higher recidivism rate. The cost of having mentally ill inmates incarcerated is high and this is due to the need for an increase in staff members and the fact that they stay longer in these facilities compare to other inmates. However, as you have stated individuals who suffered from a severe mental illness are in need of treatment rather than punishment. Therefore, the justice system should find better alternatives to reducing prison populations without intervening with the treatment of PWMI."
2212,"Hi Tamara,  Interesting discussion post. I absolutely agree with your opinion in regards to the procedures being completed in jail facilities on PWMI is unfair. Jail officials often lack the proper training to handle crisis situations involving PWMI. As you have stated solitude can be a deprivation of an individual sensory especially mentally ill inmates as they are more likely to commit suicide when placed in solitude confinement.  In a 2002 study, it was reported that 77% of the jail population who was diagnosed with a severe mental illness attempted suicide compared to 15% of the entire jail population (Torrey et. al, 2010). It was also discussed that mentally ill inmates are at risk of being abused as most officers are expected to work with criminals and not individuals with mental illness (Torrey et. al, 2010). Therefore, there is a disconnected between these two groups of people. I believe the justice system needs to focus on changing their realignment policies has it has been proven to be detrimental towards PWMI. "
2213," Risk assessments are generally used to determine whether or not the offender poses a significant risk amongst others. I believe risk assessment tools may be considered somewhat unfair in a way that there might be a possibility of a false positive. However, they can also be deemed useful as it is a predictor of recidivism rate and if used properly it can ensure public safety is met before granting an offender with a conditional release into the community (Slate et. al, 2013)."
2214,"Overall, I do think whoever is conducting these risk assessments should also take into consideration multiple factors. Such as relying on multiple assessments and not just one. That way the outcome of whether or not an offender poses a danger to others is more accurate and fair."
2215," I do not believe probation is set up well to address the supervision and treatment of PWMI as it was demonstrated that not a lot of probation officers are properly trained to handle PWMI. I believe probation is beneficial in a way that instead of locking an individual up they are given the opportunity to be in the community under certain conditions. However, this only applies to certain individuals. Probation officers need to ensure that the individual will not be a danger to the public. There are three types of conditions of probation and I believe the treatment condition can be helpful for PWMI as it focuses on education, job training, and counseling. It was estimated that 15-20% of PWMI is on probation. As it was stated in the video prison doesn’t change behavior instead it focuses on punishment and in regards to PWMI treatment is necessary. Probation focuses on rehabilitation and public safety so I would believe that it is a better alternative for PWMI instead of being incarcerated."
2216,"I wouldn't feel confident being a participant in a mental health court as it was demonstrated it can result in the criminalization of an individual and only be utilized to those who are facing a long jail/prison sentencing. I have mixed opinions about both the mental court and traditional court processing because with the mental court although it focuses on treatment while ensuring accountability it also can contribute to stigmatizing an individual, can be persuaded as coercive and treatment services are often limited. With the traditional processing, they don't take into consideration of PWMI. Overall, I think their flaws in both courts so I wouldn't have a preference."
2217," The risk-need-responsivity model (RNR) is used to reduce criminal recidivism and costs but it also focuses on correctional assessment and treatment (Skeem et. Al, 2015). It was demonstrated that the implementation of specialty probation programs can help benefit patients with mental illness as caseloads are typically below fifty individuals and it deems to focus on monitoring the individual behavior, providing rehabilitation and having access to psychiatric services(Skeem et. Al, 2018).  Probation provides the opportunity for individuals to stay in the community but under certain guidelines. Typically, when involving ""normative"" risk factors for crimes committed by patients with mental illness it can include impulsivity and anger (Skeem et. al, 2018).  The guidance that I would provide to a Chief probation officer is to use Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT can be used to help with problem solving and self-management. It was also classified to be one of the most consistent programs in reducing criminal recidivism (Skeem et. al, 2018). Another guidance I would suggest is to have certain probation officers to be trained with handling mentally ill individuals. As many mentally ill individuals do not fully understand the criminal justice process there should be more probation officers to help provide them with accurate resources. It was also demonstrated that the Reasoning and Rehabilitation (R&amp;R) can be used to reduce pro-criminal attitudes. In the article by Skeem et. Al (2018) it was stated that the field also shouldn’t rush into accepting a model that has little to no data. I think it is incredibly important to make sure that proper studies have been conducted to determine high rates of success amongst patients with mental illness prior to fully accepting it.  RNR principles can be a gateway to the next appropriate step with patients with mental illness as it helps offenders learn and change from there usual behavior. However, there is also little evidence found and they were not implemented in several geographic locations. Overall, the use of the RNR model can help promote safety to the public and the individual with mental illness. However, there still needs to be a lot of further research that is conducted to ensure patients with mental illness are receiving the proper treatment. As Skeem et. al (2015) have stated there needs to be a balance between sy"
2218, I believe the RNR would be somewhat receptive amongst mental health professionals as it is formed to reduce recidivism amongst offenders and it also focuses on correctional therapy. I believe the only concern they would have is that there has been little evidence found on the effectiveness of the RNR model. I believe the other factors besides recidivism that they would concern with for patients with mental illness are whether or not they would be able to comply with treatment either it being cognitive-behavioral therapy or medication. I also think another concern would be how patients with mental illness interact on a day to day basis with other individuals within the community.
2219,"Hi Janee,  Interesting discussion post. I also choose between the specialty probation programs and RNR model with extensive research conducted as a recommendation for a chief probation officer. With the specialty probation programs, it was demonstrated in a few studies that it is effective in reducing recidivism and the cost compare to traditional probation is a lot cheaper. Over a two year period, it was demonstrated that specialty probation cost was approximately $12,000 less per client compared to traditional probation (Skeem et. al, 2018). It was also stated that specialty probation programs were effective amongst those suffering from mental illness and with a lengthy jail stay (Skeem et. al, 2018). Developing a rapport between PWMI and probation officers is also important. As with the RNR model, I agree with your opinion that although it can be effective with PWMI there hasn't been enough strong evidence to claim that. Therefore, researchers need to conduct a further study on the impact PWMI have on the RNR model."
2220,"Hi Denise,  Interesting discussion post. I agree with your opinion that once PWMI is released into the community they should have a strong support system. It was demonstrated that PWMI have a higher rate of incarceration, homelessness, detrimental health, substance abuse, pro-criminal attitudes, antisocial associates compare to other offenders (Skeem et. al, 2018). My recommendation for the Chief probation officer is to implement specialty probations programs as they have been proven to focus on treatment and monitoring an individual behavior. In a study, it was demonstrated that PWMI chances of being rearrested after a two year probation period were 2.68 higher with traditional probation compare to specialty probation (Skeem et. al, 2018).  With RNR they are a step towards the right direction but there needs to be further studies conducted. Overall, I believe the implementation of specialty probation programs can help promote a safer community for both civilians and individuals with mental illness. "
2221,"This was a difficult question to answer but I don't find it appropriate to have tax dollars being spent on treating the mentally ill in prison. I believe government officials should find better ways to budget and use that funding for earlier treatment of PWMI rather than when it's too late. Also, I do not have prisons to be an adequate place for PWMI. It was mentioned in the Cost To Treat Mental Illness In Prisons Rising video that additional funding is needed to hire more staff and correctional officers. However, as Josh Evans who is the vice president of government relations for IRAF states,  this may be a consequence of the state poor management of spending. The cost of treatment would be much less if the government would have given mentally ill patients earlier treatment in the community such as therapy or medication rather than waiting for a serious mental illness to occur. This shifts from what could be a short term care to a long term care that affects the state's funding. It was estimated that treatment cost per PWMI is $2,200 for a community-based treatment rather than $22,000 for years of treatment in the prison system. Therefore, I believe the state needs to find better ways to provide treatment to PWMI at an earlier time."
2222,"Solitary confinement is used if an individual poses a threat to themselves or prison staff. The advantage of solitary confinement is that it maintains prison order but I find solitary confinement to have more disadvantages than advantages. It is hostile and unnecessary. It plays a huge disadvantage for inmates because they become isolated and it affects their physical, mental and psychological being. This can create suicidal ideation and self-harm. It is neglect on the prison staff as they are not monitoring the safety of these inmates. It deprives individual freedom as inmates are placed in small cells for up to 23 hours and often in a windowless room. Overall, I find solitary confinement to be inhumane."
2223,"I believe it can be possible to truly rehabilitate prisoners with mental illness if they are given adequate treatment. However, I believe those who have severe mental illness may be different. As it was stated in the video mental illness in the prison system is a huge problem and instead of punishing offenders who are mentally ill we should look at ways on how to help them. Especially if they serve their time and go back to the community we should provide them with better resources to become successful. I think the main issue the prison system has is not providing treatment to PWMI at an earlier time."
2224,It was also stated in the video that many offenders may feel anxious or depressed when being processed from the outside world to behind bars or when they are being released back to the community.
2225," I believe the prison environment might aggravate the condition of PWMI  in a way that they may feel neglected and isolated. They may also feel that their a lack of support between correctional officers/prison staff and PWMI.  Many might struggle to find a safe space to transition to society. In the video, it was demonstrated that two hundred bucks were given to offenders who were released from prison as escape money to try to make it into the real world. However, many had a hard time reintegrating back into society. I think it also important to know that these offenders are still human beings and it doesn't give anyone the right to make them feel inferior and not give them proper opportunities. I believe the justice system should focus on having the attitudes of correctional officers change especially towards PWMI.   "
2226," According to Slate et. al (2013), it was demonstrated that individuals with mental illness are three times more likely to be incarcerated compared to other inmates. It was also stated that the numbers of PWMI and the severity of PWMI is increasing within the prison system.  In a study conducted by Baillargeon et. al (2010) it was addressed that half of the state and federal prisoners meet the criteria for a substance use disorder and 11% of inmates had a combination of psychiatric and substance use disorders (Baillargeon et. al, 2010). The negative outcomes of PWMI being incarcerated are that they may suffer from a variety of symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions, they are more likely to serve longer prison sentences, their health can begin to decline and they have a higher rate of returning back to the prison system after they are released (Slate et. al, 2013).  I believe prisons can keep inmates and staff members safe by reducing stigma, focusing on rehabilitation and treatment rather than punishment and solitary confinement, changing the attitudes amongst correctional officers and other staff members as well as providing them with adequate training in regards to handling PWMI, increasing the used of standardized substance abuse screening tools and  actuarial models and lastly, providing PWMI with more community mental health services that can help with post-release supervision and care (Slate et. al, 2013). In regards to cost, I don't believe there is a set number on what is appropriate, however, as it was addressed in the video, Cost To Treat Mental Illness In Prisons Rising it was shown in Illinois the average cost of treatment per PWMI in the prison system cost $22,000 compared to $2,200 with community treatment. The biggest flaw of the prison system is that it fails to provide adequate health care to PWMI at an earlier time. Prison procedures call for evaluations to be done on an individual who may have a mental illness. However, sometimes this process can be slow and unreliable as many inmates are left unevaluated. The most common forms of mental illness found in the prison population consisted of depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia (Adams & Ferrandino,2008). Adequate treatment is needed for PWMI and failure to do so can increase the risk for high recidivism rates and suicidal ideations. It was demonstrated that actuarial models are used as a supplemental test that predicts an individual futur"
2227," Hi Robert,  Interesting discussion post. I absolutely agree with your opinion in regards to having separate living conditions for PWMI as they can be protected from emotional distress and abuse from other inmates and prison staff members. I believe the main focus should be on rehabilitation rather than punishment. It was demonstrated that a negative stigma surrounds individuals who have a mental illness and it tends to amplify a lot more when they have a criminal background often making it difficult to seek housing and employment (Baillargeon et. Al, 2010). It was also stated that PWMI have a higher risk of recidivism and this can be due to the lack of adequate treatment. Do you believe the cost spent on PWMI should be gear towards therapeutic community treatment rather than hospitalization? "
2228," Hi Tamara,  Interesting discussion post. I also agree that the prison system should focus on providing adequate training to prison staff members. That way they can grasp a better understanding of how to handle PWMI. I also choose therapeutic communities as one way to provide a safer environment for PWMI. It was demonstrated that the use of therapeutic communities is to develop and improve prosocial skills especially because PWMI typically have a rough time socializing with other inmates (Adams &. Ferrandino, 2008). I also believe taking Dvoskin & Spiers (2004) four-part approach would be beneficial towards correctional officers as it focuses on counseling, consultation, medication, behavioral programs and psychotherapy towards PWMI (Adams & Ferrandino, 2008)."
2229,The Fulton State Hospital was built in 1851 and it is one of the oldest psychiatric hospitals in Missouri. If I were a taxpayer in Missouri I would feel okay about the construction of the New Fulton State Hospital as it is deemed as a lot safer and more conducive to modern treatment.  It would also considered more possible humane treatments to help heal patients with mental illness. Psychiatric hospitals are also more equipped to handling severe PWMI compare to the prison system. Meaning they have a better admission process and the usage of medication is far more efficient. 
2230,"I would not describe the Not Guilty By Reason of Insanity as a ""Get out of Jail Free"" card. As Lionel, an NGRI Law expert stated in the video, I believe most offenders may use that claim as a way to getting out of a longer sentence, however, it was demonstrated that NGRI is only applied in 1% of cases and the success rate is in a quarter of these cases. The common standard used is the M'Naghten Rule or the ""right or wrong test"" which measures if a jury finds the defendant to have a disease in the mind and not realize what he was doing or why it was a crime that defendant is then categorized under NGRI. Overall, I believe some individuals can be mentally insane and therefore, should be placed in an institution rather than in the prison system. "
2231,"I believe how state hospitals can best deal with patient and staff safety is by increasing security, providing adequate training, and proper staffing. It was stated in the video that most inmates have dealt with sexual abuse, drug overdose, and suicides and that 96 serious assaults that occurred within the past three years have required some form of medical attention. I believe by building a positive rapport between prison staff members and PWMI it can help certain situations from escalating. "
2232," With deep brain stimulation, it was demonstrated that it is an experimental treatment meaning we are not sure if there are any negative consequences to the procedure.  Doctors say that these battery power brains can cure depression. In regards to Edith who suffered from depression, it was proven that the two electrodes have helped her. However, I believe that this type of procedure is far too risky.  It was stated that area 25 is behind controlling an individual mood and doctors weren't really sure how DBS (deep brain stimulation) functions. Overall, I think more research needs to be conducted prior to determining if this is a proper and ethical treatment for PWMI.      "
2233," I apologized. My laptop and internet connection has been giving me issues.  Transinstitutionalization has impacted how mental facilities care for its' patients. Throughout the past decades the role of care for PWMI transfer from mental institutions to jails and prisons facilities. It was demonstrated that the US. prison system holds the largest mental health care facilities with 50% of inmates having a mental illness or substance abuse disorder (Sisti et. Al, 2015). The term ""asylum"" was originally defined as a sanctuary for long term care for PWMI (Sisti et. Al, 2015). However, with the reduction of state funding towards PWMI many individuals are left with little to no treatment.  I believe the most appropriate role for state hospitals is to provide treatment for individuals who are severally mentally ill.  Staff members at state hospitals have received adequate training in regards to PWMI compared to prison systems. Originally state hospitals were used for long-term care and it was until the twentieth century did budget cuts occurred due to legal reforms, insurance programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and social welfare policies (Fisher et. Al, 2009) . The role of the state hospital in the 21 century then shift to focusing on individuals with criminal justice histories, forensic patients, sexually dangerous individuals and difficult-to discharge patients (Slate et. al, 2013).Throughout the past few decades our society has been favoring towards community-based solutions. I believe state hospitals should provide more residential programs to focus on the continuum care and treatment of PWMI.  I believe state hospitals should not be used exclusively for forensic patients because it leaves those who are mentally ill with inadequate resources or treatment . It was demonstrated that forensic patients are committed by the criminal court as they are found to be incompetent or because they were adjudicated as NGRI (not guilty by reason of insanity) (Fisher et. Al, 2019).  The population of this group has continued to increase since the 1970s such as in Massachusetts the percentage of forensic patients has increased by 50% and in Pennsylvania it has increased by 379%. The issue with this is that it affects the state hospitals operations and financing by providing criminal courts power over admissions and discharges of forensic patients leaving the state"
2234,"Hi Jennifer,  Interesting discussion post. I agree in regards to the screening process. I feel like state hospitals have the adequate equipment and training to screen former PWMI. According to Sisti et. al (2015) it was demonstrated that in the state of Texas, the cost of care for individuals with mental illness in the prison system estimates between $30,000-50,000 a year compare to those without an mental illness it estimates to $22,000. It was also stated that PWMI had a high recidivism rate as they are constantly being place and removed from being hospitalized in crisis situations to becoming homeless and then being incarceration (Sisti et. al, 2015). As you mention it becomes a revolving door for PWMI as they are not given the proper treatment. "
2235,"Hi Gabby,  Interesting discussion post. I also agree with your point of view that PWMI should have access to rehabilitation and community treatment programs rather than being placed in the criminal justice system. According to Sisti et. al (2015) more facilities such as the Worcester Recovery & Hospital should be placed if increase of funding is provided as it focuses on integrated treatment services. It was also stated that individuals who had severe psychotic disorders which made them unsafe to the community should be place in state hospitals for long-term care as they are more humane and safe for PWMI rather than placing them in the prison facilities. According to the Department of State Hospital 2018 Annual Report, 89% of the patients demographics who are committed fall under forensic patients while 11% are civil. This comes to show that state hospitals focus more on forensic patients than those who mentally ill. Overall, I believe state hospitals should aim on providing more treatment to PWMI as it was demonstrated by numerous studies that placement into the prison system for PWMI can have detrimental consequences. "
2236,"After watching the video I believe the forms of data sharing can seem as satisfactory for understanding the link between the criminal justice and mental health systems and their clients. The study found that some individuals who were arrested and suffer from mental illness  were identified by one agency and when they passed through another agency they didn't receive adequate treatment. It was demonstrated that identifying an individual health needs isn't a priority to the criminal justice system and that the two systems do not collaborate well. I think what needs to be done to improve links is to ensure individuals are being properly evaluated. As it was stated in the video, many individuals are left unaware that they have a mental illness and as a result, they do not seek mental health care services. I also believe having both agencies to share information on an individual treatment needs is important for better communication."
2237,"After watching the video, I noticed the CIT officer was calm and took the PWMI medication off the table. He focused on having a conversation and asking questions. He showed empathy and even told the PWMI ""I can see you're upset and we're here to help you and get you the services with the right people."" He suggested several opinions such as going to the hospital to get a medical clearance or reaching out to  Can Help which sends a counselor to go to the scene and to help provide mental health care services. The use of CIT training can also help identify any symptoms of mental illness. Whereas, with a routine law enforcement encounter the officer lacks adequate training with handling crisis situations especially with PWMI. They may become aggressive and instead of deescalating the situation they can cause the PWMI to become more agitated."
2238,"As it was stated in the video, the changes made in the departments of corrections were due to multiple PWMI suing the facility stating there was a lack of mental health care services provided. Aside from that correctional officers do not have adequate training to handle PWMI. More than 20,000 inmates are housed in the state prison facilities and 3,000 individuals are mentally ill. It was stated that the mental health care services provided for PWMI are understaffed. I believe due to budget cuts the prison system fails to see mental health care as a priority amongst prison inmates."
2239,"The challenge I think the mental health workers might have to deal with in the correctional environment is based on the severity of that individual mental illness. As the video states, prisoners can see through someone who isn't authentic and how we treat prisoners is a reflection on how we treat the most vulnerable citizens within our society. I believe cross-training with correctional agencies would help as it would focus more on rehabilitation rather than punitive methods. It would show that there are people who are concern about an individual welfare"
2240,"Another challenge I could see is in regards to one safety. In the video, it was mentioned that the employees felt safe but I still feel like in the prison system that a huge challenge that would need to be dealt with. "
2241," I believe both the Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) Model and the NAMI- Indiana training program should be implemented more in the criminal justice system. Both programs have been showed to reduce force amongst PWMI. With the CIT model, it has been suggested as a “Best practice” model in law enforcement (Watson. & Fulambarker, 2012). The CIT model originated in 1988 when a PWMI from Memphis was fatally shot by a police officer. The CIT Model is used to help provide individuals with mental illness with resources to mental health care providers as well as to establish a rapport between law enforcement officers and PWMI. It also builds empathy and it helps the PWMI feel included by asking a series of questions rather than making assumptions. It helps to create a safer environment during encounters. It was demonstrated that 15% of CIT officers used force when it was classified as a high violence risk and often relied on low-lethality methods (Watson & Fulumbarker, 2012). Within the criminal justice system, there is an estimate of 31 percent of females and 14.5 percent of males with a severe mental illness. According to Watson & Fulambarker (2012) without adequate training police officials can escalate an encounter with PWMI. I believe police officials should be required to take this training. At the moment 1,000 CIT models are being implemented worldwide and it's optional. It consists of 40 hours of training dedicated to crisis situations (Watson & Fulambarker, 2012). CIT training provides officers with additional skills. In the article, it was stated that the CIT model is focused on not how many officers are trained but on having the right officers be trained for it. Although I agree with this statement I do believe half of all officers should be trained. It’s important to notice that there are times were CIT officers may not be available since they may be dispatched to another location and because there is a limited amount of trained CIT officers this opens the doors for regular police officials to take dispatch calls that involve PWMI. Police officials can use aggression and violence as they are use to violent encounters. Therefore, I believe officers should be trained in the fundamentals of handling crisis situations and if an individual wants further training then they have that option to receive additional training.  Similar to the CIT model the NAMI- Indiana Training program provides 10 hours of training and"
2242,"Hi Stephanie,  Interesting discussion post. I also choose the CIT model. As you have stated police interactions without any training can lead to violence to the officer and the PWMI. It was demonstrated that originally 20-25% of the Memphis team wanted the police officers to be require to have CIT training to ensure 24/7 availability in cases of crisis situations (Watson & Fulambarker,2012). However, this changed throughout the years only making it optional to those who wanted additional training.The NAMI program is beneficial for PWMI placed in special housing units as it focuses on understanding PWMI. It was demonstrated that correctional officers play an important role in providing safety and security to inmates and often times they are subject to long hours, low pay and risk of violence (Parker,2009). I believe by establishing a rapport with PWMI, correctional officers can develop more of an understanding and empathy towards them. "
2243,"Hi Viviana,  Interesting discussion post. I also choose the CIT model and I agree that it should be mandatory for all officers. As you have stated the use of the CIT model can help de-escalate a crisis situation.  It was demonstrated that CIT curriculums include content on trauma and excited delirium, developmental disabilities and older adult issues (Watson & Fulambarker, 2012). The implementation of CIT models can help officers to direct PWMI to adequate mental health care services. However, according to Watson & Fulambarker (2012) the success of the CIT model also depends on the collaboration with psychiatric emergency services. "
2244," It was demonstrated that 850,000 individuals who are mentally ill are either on probation or parole. According to the statement of Fairfax County Sheriff, it was demonstrated that 40% of all jail inmates have a mental illness or substance use disorder. I believe Fairfax focuses on non-violent offenders because they have a large percentage of mentally ill inmates and I believe they came into a realization that individuals who are mentally ill need treatment, not punishment. Fairfax County Government launched a diversion first program to help focus on diverting individuals who are not violent and to guide them towards treatment so they can live a productive life in our society.  There has also been more implementation of CIT training and assessment to help determine one behavior as a result of the need for mental health treatment. I believe what should be done with violent offenders is that they are placed in different areas from those who are mentally ill. This would increase security and safety in prisons/jails."
2245,"I believe the hurdles for the criminal justice system and mental health agencies are different in implementing evidence-based practices. Evidence-based practices need to have scientific principles. I believe mental healthcare agencies are more obligated to implement these programs as a way of seeking treatment however, with the criminal justice system I feel like they are more doubtful on whether these programs are efficient in helping individuals with mental illness. Also, the budget is different for both so I feel like this alone impacts how many programs should be implemented for PWMI. "
2246,"I believe an integrated Mental Health and Substance Abuse model would change the way the justice system works with individuals with co-occurring disorders that it would create a pathway towards recovery. Co-occurring disorders consist of individuals having two disorders such as having a mental illness and substance use disorder. It was demonstrated that 8.9 million people experience some type of co-occurring disorder. With SAMHSA it was stated that recovery is a holistic process. The program focuses on providing patients with mental illness to treatment such as psychological, therapeutic help and counseling. A patient named Pastor stated that by having access to multiple resources it motivates him to seek and continue treatment. The integration of these models also bring a form of inclusion towards patients and family members."
2247,I believe peer mentoring might be helpful in addressing the stigma of mental illness because it can help with the recovery process. It brings a sense of belonging and empowerment. Peer mentors can sympathize with each other and look after each other well-being. Peer mentors can also share their experiences with one another and act as a support group. It can also help motivate them to help others in the future since they receive some form of treatment.  
2248," The full implementation of the recommendations of the position paper of the American College of Physicians affects the involvement, identification, treatment, and outcomes of the mentally ill in the criminal justice system by integrating behavioral health into a primary care setting. Behavioral health can be referred to as substance abuse disorders, mental illness or a combination of the two. The integration of behavioral care into a primary care setting can include selective screening, diagnosis, referral and brief treatment (Crowley et. Al, 2015). In a 2013 National Survey on Drug Use it was estimated that 43.8 million U.S. adults had a mental illness in the past year (Crowley et. Al, 2015). Implementation of these recommendations can help remove payment barriers, strengthen nondiscrimination laws, promote increase research, training programs and eliminate negative stigma associated with mental health (Crowley et. Al, 2015). It was demonstrated that individuals who suffered from a mental illness are at risk for having high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, obesity and asthma (Crowley et. Al, 2015).  The financial outcomes for having a behavioral or comorbid disorder consisted of being 2 times more expensive than patients with just physical needs (Crowley et. Al, 2015). However, there are implications for integrated behavioral health care in a primary care setting. One is that both have a history of operating differently and the other is that a vast majority of patients don't have access to treatment. There are different levels of integration in the primary care setting. One is coordinated care which focuses on making referrals to community behavioral health practitioners. The second one is colocated care which aims at reducing the numbers of ""no shows"" by giving a description of where services can be provided. Lastly, integrated care aims to unified a patient care plan. Implementation of these recommendations can affect involvement between mental health care providers and the criminal justice system because mental health providers are often stigmatized in a similar way as their patients(Munetz & Teller, 2004). The criminal justice system aims at holding individuals accountable for their actions. The mental health care system aims at providing treatment for individuals with mental illness by relying on a community-based alternatives.  It was demonstrated that in 1996 about 7.9% of the county jail population had i"
2249,"Hi Stephanie,  Interesting discussion post.  Relevant training and education is vital for both systems to collaborate together as well as to minimize any negative stigma on mentally ill patients. It was demonstrated that primary care physicians often lack extensive clinical training in behavioral health and the models of mental health care and clinical care are often different (Crowley et. al, 2015). I believe by developing a clearer understanding and using collaboration both fields can help PWMI.  Budget cuts are also a huge factor, between 2009-2012 an estimate of $4.35 billion was cut on mental health care (Crowley et. al, 2015). It's important to prioritize this as it has been proven a vast majority of individuals suffer from one or two mental illnesses."
2250,"Hi Cornise,  Interesting discussion post.  I agree with you that better health care will result in a better diagnosis. I believe it is important for PWMI to have access to a variety of resources. It is already difficult on their own to seek treatment and therefore, I believe mental health care providers and clinicians should aim at receiving more training and to be educated on the matter. Especially when a vast majority have a negative stigma on PWMI.  It was demonstrated that a reason for not following through with outpatient mental health referrals was due to 59% of patients not having adequate health insurance coverage (Crowley et. al, 2015). Another issue is that it was stated that 55% of the U.S. counties didn't have a practicing social worker or psychologist. This can overall, negatively affect patients with mental illness as they are left with limited options. "
2251,"The death of Timothy Souders could have been prevented by having proper staff to treat him. Even though the jail was equipped with a clinical psychiatrist he was on leave. However, the staff should have been replaced right away especially with the numerous amount of inmates suffering from mental illness. Additionally correctional guards should be trained to recognize the signs of mental illness. Even though guards themselves are attacked by inmates they should not immediately believe they are being manipulated. Alternatively, they should see if certain behaviors are being caused by underlying factors such as mental illness. Additionally, these behaviors should be reported right away so orders can be made for a psychiatric evaluation."
2252,"The stigma around mental illness has led to inhumane non- medical treatment of patients of mental illness. For instance during Pre- Civilization individuals with mental illness were banished from the collective which resulted in death. Other groups removed parts of their skulls to expose the brain and release the spirits. These non-medical treatments led to the ostracization of individuals of mental illness. For example, in 1773 the first psychiatric institution was established in the U.S., which led to additional institutions. However, conditions in these institutions was poor and continue to build a negative stigma around mental illness. Additionally these institutions were built away from communities as response the concept of not in my backyard. Even though institutions led to medical treatments of PWMI’s the continued seclusion of facilities continued to fuel the negative stigma surrounding mental illness. "
2253,"I believe having a mental illness registry is more harmful than beneficial. Having a registry will continue to fuel the idea that PWMI’s are violent. These pre notions will only continue to ostracize PWMI’s in communities. As we have seen the lack of community ties leads to homelessness, unemployment which in turn leads to them to enter the criminal justice system. Additionally, it has been found mental illness is not linked to violence thus, targeting individuals with mental illness is not the solution for reducing gun violence. Furthermore, having a registry can lead to individuals to not seek help for their illness as they will not want to face the ostracization that comes with their diagnosis. "
2254,"One of the biggest challenges for PWMI’s as a result of deinstitutionalization is the lack of community support they have available. A lack of community support leads to homelessness, unemployment and being ostracized  which leads to PWMI’s entering the criminal justice system. The stigma around mental illness does not allow PWMI’s to be reintegrated into community so, they can become law abiding citizens. Thus, community support is one of the biggest issues affected PWMI’s as they are not accepted and do not receive the adequate support to overcome their mental illness.  Therefore, more efforts should be made by communities to help integrate PWMI's back into society.  "
2255,"           Mental illness early on has been viewed as negative. During Pre-Civilization individuals who did not fit in the collective were banished which ultimately resulted in death. Additionally other groups removed parts of the skull to expose the brain to release evil spirits. Philosophers such as Hippocrates believed mental illness could be cured by taking laxatives which would cleanse the body of impurities. During the Middle Ages individuals with mental illness continued to be outcasted in which some were tortured and murdered. Furthermore, the Renaissance led to the emergence of humanism which led to eradication of non-medical practices of torture and execution. This new philosophy led to the building of institutions.  However, the care in institutions further secluded individuals with mental illness. All these views of the treatment of individuals with mental illness has built a negative stigma around mental illness. This negative stigma has led to individuals believe that PWMI’s cannot be full pledged members of society. Additionally, the media has portrayed PWMI's as violent which diminishes the idea that they can overcome their illness and be integrated in society without the public believing they are harmful.              Furthermore, the concept of deinstitutionalization has failed as PWMIs are not equipped with support to be reintegrated to society successfully.  However, currently more advocacy for PWMI’s has emerged which fuels the self determination of PWMI’s to overcome their obstacles. With the awareness of mental illness on the rise it will be easier for PWMI’s to overcome the negative stigma of their diagnosis. For instance, mental illness has grabbed more attention as celebrities have come forward with their diagnosis. As advocacy for mental illness rises, individuals will no longer feel ostracized and those who have not been diagnosed will be encouraged to do so."
2256,"Hi Lisa, I definitely agree that mental illness early on has had a negative stigma.  It has predominantly established that individuals with metal illness cannot care for themselves and undermine their self-determination. Movements such as deinstitutionalization have tried to encourage self determination but has failed with allocating community resources for them to become full pledged citizens.  I agree you when you say that we are not there yet with allocating resources for them.  Its  an ongoing debate and will be interesting how it will pan out in the future.  Great job at detailing your thoughts!"
2257,"Hi Amber! You brought up a great point about the media. Just as Szasz points out the media oftentimes perpetrates mental illness to be behind violent acts. This propaganda does not allow the public to perceive PWMIs as full pledged citizens and undermines their self-determination to overcome these false perceptions. Hopefully in the future the media will move past these negative connotations and will portray PWMIs without biases. Additionally, mental illness has grabbed more attention as celebrities have shared their own battle with mental illness so hopefully that will sway the public from believing all PWMI's are harmful.  "
2258,"I feel that society should not step in to administer treatment as it can take away the liberty of PWMI’s choosing treatment or not. This can be harmful as it increases the stigma that PWMI’s cannot care for themselves and are not self-determined. However, I believe family should be granted permission to step in for treatment. Family should be able to step in if they are aware their love one is suffering from metal illness so they can get adequate treatment. Additionally, once a PWMI’s is able to care for themselves the guardianship can be removed."
2259,The cuts on mental health programs says that policymakers are not worried about increasing funding. It seems like policymakers do not believe this an issue that needs to be fixed. Policymakers are not worried in how devastating decreasing funding is for PWMIs. Not receiving adequate help can be disastrous to the individual as it can result in homelessness and their inability to sustain a job as they lose treatment. I believe that all health care programs are equally important. No patient should be seen as less than or receive less benefits.
2260,"A president can end stigma around mental illness by raising more awareness about mental illness. Additionally, campaigns should be made that are centered around mental illness for instance having chats about it and implementing more PSA’s. Public figures should also participate in sharing their battle against mental illness. Furthermore, the president should increase the funding for mental health programs and should make resources accessible available for those seeking help. Creating programs that increase affordable housing and employment for PWMI’s would be steps in the right direction for creating stability. Having these resources would raise awareness that PWMI’s can be citizens of society and can combat their mental illness."
2261,"One recommendation from active duty and military veterans to cope with their diagnosis is to create a support group among themselves in which they can talk and share their stories. Additionally, these talks should be monitored by a psychiatrist who can evaluate and teach effective coping skills. Furthermore, medication should not be used first thing as treatment. As the soldier in the video clip shared some veterans and active military suffer from substance abuse before serving. Thus, administering medication is not advised as it they can have further escalate their illness."
2262,"          Implementing a curriculum based on age would be great to teach children about mental illness. Elementary school aged children would benefit from reading stories and songs about mental illness. Working with children with Autism and reading age appropriate books about how to deal about our emotion has been beneficial. I have seen children who do not suffer from a disorder find it “weird” when children with special needs are not acting appropriate. Thus, having a curriculum that teaches mental illness would lessen that stigma.            Children in middle school and high school would benefit from having week by week chats with their school psychologist to discuss any issues that they are facing. At this age the body goes through changes which can result in anxiety and pre-teens and teens should be more aware of those changes and how it affects their mental state. Additionally, staff should also be trained to notice the signs of mental illness so they can better serve their students. Furthermore, high schools should create a mental health class that digs deeper and gives students and understanding of what mental illness is and how it looks like."
2263,"Hi Jennifer, I definitely agree with you! Information about mental illness should be conveyed in a way people can understand it. I agree when you say that medical and mental health should be treated the same. Just as you go see the doctor for a flu you can see a mental health provider,  Additionally, having guest speakers who suffer from mental illness in school is a great way for students to ask and be informed. Having a speaker would create personal connection that just reading from a book.   "
2264,"Hi Gabby,  I definitely agree with your points.  You touched up on a great point which is suicide. High school students should definitely have more support services. As you mentioned perhaps having these supports can stop students from committing suicide.  Additionally, staff should be trained to see any red flags and  take immediate action to help students. I believe sometimes staff believe some maladaptive behavior is part of acting out however, it can be result of a mental illness. "
2265,"Specificity and sensitivity can make diagnosis tests more accurate however, increasing or decreasing specificity and sensitivity may alter results and increase the number of false positive and false negatives. Depending on who makes these tests it can have a variation of how  results are interpreted. Thus, if researchers are looking for a particular result, sensitivity and specificity can alter those results. Having results being manipulated can be risky for society and individuals alike.  False positives are risky for individuals as people may be misdiagnosed and may be committed.  This can result in individuals who need treatment go on without treatment because treatment will go those have been misdiagnosed instead to true positives. Additionally, this will result in a loss of funds to society and create an unsafe environment because individuals who need help are without treatment. Alternatively, false negatives is risky for society as individuals may be diagnosed as not being dangerous and will continue to be out in society. Furthermore, these individuals will continue to go under the radar without getting treated or being committed.  As we have learned this can be disastrous as this can result in homelessness, unemployment and can be a gateway to entering the criminal justice system. "
2266,"I believe civil commitment for sex offenders after they complete their sentence is not good idea as they have already served the time for their crime. Additionally, not all sex offenders may not continue to be a threat after they have served their time. In the case of Derek, he was a minor when convicted and was civilly committed after his time served and his case should have been approached differently. Furthermore, if these individuals should be monitored it should be in a more practical manner such as having mandatory therapy/ meetings or be in probation and have a parole officer that they should meet on regular basis. . Methods as these would not be only practical and be more cost effective than having these individuals be civilly committed. Additionally, cases should be seen by a case by case basis as some offenders may not be violent while other offenders should be monitored more closely. "
2267,"I do believe that inpatient and outpatient commitment can play a role in affecting an individual’s liberty. Inpatient programs can take away from the individual’s decision to seek treatment. It also imposes them to be in a facility without being able to leave for an extended amount of time. Even though some individuals may benefit from the treatment for others it can take away their liberty to choose if they want to take certain medication or treatment.  Furthermore, outpatient and impatient programs are coercive as well as medication is forced.  The coercion of treatment affects the patient and provider relationship, as patients have no say and fuels the idea that patients cannot decide for themselves. Thus, having these limitations in freedom is a reach by the sate to take away an individuals liberty. "
2268,"            Inpatient Civil Commitment provides treatment for PWMI’s, prevents self-harm, it protects society as PWMI’s cannot harm others and it provides families relief as they know their loved ones are getting care. However before individuals are committed, they must be diagnosed with a mental illness, be a danger to self or others, gravely disabled, are incompetent and is administered when a least restrictive alternative is not available. In order for this process to begin an employee of the state must screen the individuals, next an evaluation is administered and lastly a commitment hearing takes place if criteria is met. However, civil commitment can be coercive, anti-therapeutic, increases the stigma that PWMI are violent and discriminatory. Swanson et al., (2009) illustrate how racial disparities in involuntary outpatient commitment is an ongoing debate. However, it was found in Swanson et al., (2009) that racial bias does not exist however, African Americans are more likely to suffer from mental illness. In turn, according to this week’s lectures over representation of African Americans leads to be more likely be treated with coercion.                 Conversely Outpatient Commitment allows individuals retain then liberty as they are not in a facility.  However, it is only for those who do not meet the criteria for inpatient commitment criteria. Supporters of Outpatient programs argue that medication compliance is higher even though it is coercive. Additionally patients engage in continued treatment, enjoy a better quality of life, decreases homelessness and decreases criminal victimization. However, outpatient treatment still remains coercive as medication is forced and continues to be stigmatizing. Furthermore, it can be anti-therapeutic and disempowering as well.                  Even though both treatments are proven to be successful changes need to be made to be even more effective and less stigmatizing. Inpatient civil commitment should be less coercive and allow patients to choose the treatment they want administered.  Allowing patients to choose treatment would lessen the stigma that PWMI’s are not able to make their own decisions and are dependent on others to make those choices. Furthermore, less coercive measures would increase the patient’s satisfaction in treatment and have a more positive outlook on inpatient civil commitment. As found in Swartz at al., (2003) coercion frequently damages patient and provider relati"
2269,"Hi Suz,  You made great valid points! I definitely agree that these programs jeopardize patient and provider relationship. Even though they want to guarantee success and get individuals help it can be done in a coercive manner. I enjoyed reading your recommendations such as providing resources such as jobs. However, as we have learned in past lectures, some would choose not to disclose their mental illness. Do you think disclosing should be optional in order for them not feel lesser members of society?"
2270,"Hi Briana, Great post! I definitely agree that reducing stigma is key for the success of both programs. Raising more awareness of mental illness is crucial for the recovery of PWMI. In addition, this may help individuals seek help as they may not feel as outsiders. You also mentioned that evaluation is important however, we learned in this weeks lecture that some can have false negatives or false positives. Do you think there should be standard for evaluation?"
2271,"         I believe the stage that is mos difficult for PWMI is during adjudication. I believe adjudication is the most difficult as PWMI may not fully understand the plea deals they are given. Plea deals along with legal terminology can be quite difficult to understand and someone who is in a unstable metal state can have increased difficulty. In addition, they might accept  pleading  guilty when innocent thinking they are better off. However, most  plea deals result in incarceration which can be more detrimental to PWMI's. Furthermore, as we have learned imprisonment creates matters worse for PWMI as they are not receiving the medical treatment they need. "
2272,"I believe police officers should not serve as first responders to situations involving to PWMI. Police officers are not equipped with the best knowledge about PWMI. In addition, police officers are not extensively trained  to deal with PWMI and sometimes  can result in the death of PWMI. As we saw in this lectures YouTube video, family members turn to police officers to handle PW MI however, these altercations can result in death. Even though they may be more empathetic towards PWMI than the public, they still perceive PWMI to be violent.  However, their interactions with PWMI is increasing which should lead to police officers being extensively trained in dealing with PWMI."
2273,"            The CIT program was founded in lessening the stigma of police officers around mental illness, ensure the safety of officers, offer support services, decrease the number of PWMI injuries, and deaths during police altercations and reduce criminalization and arrests of PWMI. The CIT program offers a new way of treating individuals in crisis in the community however, Taheri has found no significant results in the effectiveness of the CIT program and shows null effects on the number of arrests and officer safety (2016). Even though this program has not showed results statistically, nevertheless, should be continued to be used. Despite of not showing efficacy as Taheri suggests the program should be improved to better to show significant results. For instance, officers should be trained more extensively in de-escalation techniques as a call-based study showed increased force used by CIT officers (Taheri, 2016). Additionally, officers should be mandated to receive this training nationwide. As Taheri points out officer’s volunteer to participate in the training of this program however, this can skew results of significance. As Taheri further illustrates officers who choose to participate may be systematically different compared to other officers (2016). These officers may have already be diverting PWMI’s to facilities or were actively skilled in de-escalation techniques. Furthermore, as Taheri illustrates CIT programs need to be more elicit and outline which specific calls requires CIT officers. Thus, dispatchers along with officers should be more extensively trained to classify CIT related calls and non-CIT calls. Differentiating which calls require CIT officers would allocate resources more appropriately. Allocating resources would better serve PWMI and get needed treatment sooner. Additionally, it would decrease arrest of PWMI and allows the public to see officers are ready to serve and protect in the community no matter what individual is in distress.  "
2274,"The CIT program and stigma are related as it contributes in lessening the stigma around mental illness. The CIT program trains officers in using de-escalation techniques and offer support services to PWMI. Additionally, the CIT program provides information in the signs and symptoms of mental illness along with types of medication one can take. Furthermore, it strives to ensure the safety of the officer and the individual in crisis. All these components of the CIT program strive to reduce the stigma of mental illness. It also advocates the notion that PWMI should not be criminalized rather need to be referred to facilities. As we have learned PWMIs first encounter with the criminal justice system is with police. Having police officers trained to be specialized in dealing with PWMI reduces the stigma officers have towards PWMI’s. As we saw in a previous  YouTube clip and we saw an officer resolve an issue with an individual by just praying. The officer mentions how in some cases an individual just needs someone to talk to.  As we see here the stigma is lessened and CIT training effectively lessens the stigma surrounded mental illness."
2275,"Hi Amber, Great post! I definitely agree that the CIT should be continued to be used. Even though Taheri did not find significant results, changes to this program can make it effective. I agree that the training of this program should be more extensive. Additionally, I agree that training should take place in the academy as well as through out their officer career. You also brought up a great point in the way this program can be ineffective, such as having officers respond to the same individual in multiple occasions.  Taheri mentioned something similar as she recommends having staff be trained to differentiate which calls need CIT officers. Just as calls can be differentiated according to case, calls can be differentiated according to individuals.  This can create efficiency it can allow officers to start a referral process to a facility. Lastly, you also mentioned how officers are not mandated to take this training.  This to me is alarming as having this training is critical and useful to the officer and PWMI and makes me wonder when this will be mandated nationwide. "
2276,"Hi Steve, Great post! I agree that this program should continue even though Taheri did not find significant results. I believe the limitations of this study should be addressed first to conclude if this program is efficient and make improvements if needed. Additionally, thanks for going through this training and sharing your personal experience. I'm glad to see that you found it useful. As Taheri mentioned, officers who participate in this program are programmed systematically different. She further mentions these officers already had experience in de-escalation techniques or were already diverting PWMI’s to facilities. Were these factors that Taheri mentions  your reasoning to take the training as well?  "
2277,"The changes in CA can be beneficial for PWMI who were incarcerated for nonviolent and non-serious crimes  and charged with felonies would now be charged with misdemeanors. Furthermore, the new changes are working towards  expunging certain crimes which is beneficial when looking for employment. Additionally, reducing the prison costs would result in additional funding for PWMI services. However, for PWMI who are in county jails the new changes have resulted in budget costs. These budget cuts have decreased the mental health services in jails. Additionally, PWMI who have been released early has resulted in receiving no treatment and being out in the streets."
2278,"              Insufficient funding for PWMI in the prison has led to disastrous results. Prisons are becoming the new asylums. Healthcare coverage and treatment funding becomes less and less for PWMI. As result, more and more PWMI are entering the criminal justice system. As discussed by Raphael & Stoll (2013) policy changes to mental health such as deinstitutionalization has played a role in the incarceration growth on PWMI.  This increase has flooded prisons and jails with PWMI. Additionally, with jail growth, budgets for mental health decreased as budgets needed to be allocated for prison growth (Raphael & Stoll). Furthermore, PWMI have been subjected to face harsher penalties for crimes as policies have changed towards a more aggressive sentence structure (Raphael & Stoll, 2013). As a result, PWMI get trapped in the criminal justice rather being admitted into a mental hospital.  Additionally, new measures such as Realignment policies came in effect to decrease the number of inmates which had detrimental results for PWMI.  Before Realignment Policies were put in place PWMI were guaranteed some sort of treatment for the mental illness during their stay at prisons. However, as the main focus has been to decrease the number of incarcerated individuals, budgets have decreased. These budget cuts have caused for PWMI in prisons to receive little or no treatment at all. Additionally, upon release PWMI receive some medication and are not given enough resources to be reintegrated back to society which results in high recidivism (Torrey et al.,2010). Torrey et al., (2010) describe PWMI as being “frequent flyers” as high numbers of PWMI are readmitted to corrections due to the lack of resources in the community. Furthermore, prison staff are not equipped with how to deal with PWMI which leads to abuse (Torrey et al., 2010). Thus, policy changes in incarceration, mental health cuts and Realignment Policies have played a role in the inappropriate treatment towards PWMI. More and more PWMI are entering the criminal justice system rather than receiving appropriate treatment."
2279,"Hi Janee, Great post! I definitely agree that allocating PWMI in prisons is inappropriate. As you mentioned budget cuts and lack of staff creates more distress among PWMI. PWMI are not guaranteed somewhat of a treatment while being detained. Additionally, upon release they go out into the streets with little to no medication and plan of action resulting in high recidivism rates among PWMI. It will be interesting how future policies will be put in place to combat this issue. With the awareness growing about the inappropriate treatment towards with PWMI, do you think policy makers will start to allocating budgets or start policy reforms for PWMI?"
2280,"Hi Amber, Great post! I agree that using jails to treat PWMI is inappropriate. As you, I see the benefits of Realignment for the general population as sentences are shortened or expunged however, places PWMI at a disadvantage.  These new policies decrease budgets for prisons which results in PWMI in receiving little to no treatment. In the future do you see Realignment policies creating a plan for PWMI reintegrate back into the community?"
2281,"I would assume that going to jail for a PWMI for more than 100 times must be frustrating. Prisons are becoming asylums, and this is not where they should be. PWMI should be receiving medical treatment and not be warehoused at a jail. Some of them are in prison for small theft such as stealing food or for trespassing as they are looking for shelter. Additionally, when released they are not given any resources to reintegrate into the community. I can imagine  its tough  for someone who is trying to overcome their mental illness and society is putting them in jails and not giving them the support they need. I would also imagine behaviors and illnesses get worse at they are not receiving adequate care in prison and when they face instability upon release resulting in high recidivism rates among PWMI."
2282,"I believe jails should use number of jail admissions of an individual, prescriptions of antipsychotics, and medical records should be used in the jail system as indicators to keep how many individuals suffer from  mental illness in prisons . The number of admissions in jail can determine what the individuals has been in for such as theft. This indicator can show that an individual who has been there multiple times for petty crimes can suffer from a mental illness. In addition keeping track of the prescriptions can help track what inmates can be suffering from mental illness. Furthermore, jails should look at an individual’s medical records to see how many times they have admitted to a hospital and for what reason. Using these indicators my help indicate if an inmate is suffering from mental illness and keep track of how many are entering jails or prisons.  "
2283,"I believe prisoners are granted the right amount of rights. Even though prisoners might be monitored as what they write in letters or calls, this information is used to monitor safety. Despite of this, inmates are granted the right to receive medical attention. Having the right to receive medical is important as this can be only form of treatment some PWMI may receive. They are also granted freedom of religion and freedom of expression."
2284,"I believe medication is the most form of treatment because its seen at the go to when dealing with mental illness. Giving an individual medication is much easier than working together with the individual. Furthermore, not enough psychiatric staff can also lead to the use of medication. Budget cuts have created staff cuts which results in decreased use of alternative methods of treatment such as talk therapies.  As mentioned in this weeks lecture the use of de-escalation techniques and debriefing of incidents is critical to prevent future incidents. However, not having enough staff can get in the way of these practices."
2285,"I believe it is not fair to use risk assessment tools especially when they are not 100%. I believe that each case should be examined case by case. It is not fair that based on how an individual score determines which treatment he receives. It seems that individuals are being placed under the same umbrella and given the same treatment based on their score. However, an individual may need less or more services than appointed based on their score. Additionally, as we have learned tests results can give false negatives or false positives which puts individuals at risk of getting an unreasonable sentence or serve less time than needed. "
2286,"I do not believe mental health professionals would be so receptive to the RNR approach with PWMI in the justice system. I believe mental health professionals would determine treatment based on the individual and not on the one size fits all approach of the RNR. Additionally, linking mental illness to crime continues to fuel the notion that PWMI are violent. Furthermore, as addressed by the YouTube clip, crime can be related to other factors such as unemployment and poverty."
2287,"I believe probation is a good way to supervise and treat PWMI.  Probation creates a personalized plan for each individual. Probation officers work through behaviors to reduce recidivism. Additionally, probation officers find housing and employment opportunities for individuals. As we have learned these factors are key when trying to reduce the number of PWMI in the criminal justice system.  Furthermore probation is cost effective and can yield more results than being in jail. In jail individuals are hurdled with the masses and when released offers no plan to integrate society. Thus, probation can offer more services and help integrate PWMI into society as opposed to jails. "
2288,"I think I would feel more confident that I would receive the treatment I need in a mental health court. Additionally I would not feel weary of the court process as the process is not adversarial. Mental health courts have more of a therapeutic approach, judges serve as a coach and focus on rehabilitation rather than being punitive. Additionally, multiple hearings take place to track progress and help reduce recidivism. I would prefer to participate in a mental health court as it gives me a better chance of receiving treatment that I need."
2289,"            The RNR as shown can provide results in reducing recidivism. However as Skeem et al., (2015) illustrate the RNR should be used with caution as it should be furthered examined as there is too little data.  Additionally the RNR does not prioritize psychiatric services which have shown to be effective (Skeem et al., 2015).  As we have learned in past weeks psychiatric services are a must to fully integrated PWMI upon release into the community. As addressed by Skeem at al., (2015) the RNR is not ready to be generalized as the results may not be applicable to all PWMI. The RNR excludes low risk offenders until they have criminogenic needs and focuses more so on high risk PWMI. However, this can be problematic as low risk offenders should not be excluded. As found by Skeem & Manchak (2011) specialty mental health programs vs traditional treatment was found to be more cost effective. Thus, I would recommend to Chief Probation officers to look into improving areas of the RNR such as tailoring programs to the individuals. As we saw in one of this week’s YouTube clip the San Diego Probation Chief and his officers focus in facilitating behavior change and in addition create an individualized case plans for each individual. Furthermore, each plan concentrates with matching each individual with the services they need such as employment and housing. The implementation of personalized plans is trivial as it can hold individuals accountable such as the San Diego Probation Chief advises. Therefore, I would recommend implementing a personalized plan along with the RNR in efforts to reduce recidivism to Chief Probation Officers. Additionally, the RNR, matches the individual with services in the community that may be inconsistent with the needs and wants of the individual. For instance, Skeem et al., (2015) note the highest risk factors are common among individuals without mental illness and PWMI. Thus, programs that target these factors may not target other variables that may not reduce the rate of recidivism (Skeem at al., 2015). Therefore, tailoring programs is essential to address additional factors that may reduce recidivism. References Skeem J.L., Manchak S.M., (2012). Does specialty mental health probation “fight crime and save money”? A cost-benefit analysis. Presented at the American Psychology-Law Society (AP-LS) annual conference"
2290,"Hi Janee, Great post! I definitely agree with your suggestion. I also believe that probation officers should implement specialty probation programs.   Having PWMI and officers create a interpersonal relationship is essential as it can help PWMI better integrate into society. I believe the RNR lacks this type of relationship as  a score determines what type of treatment you need. Additionally, this method would better serve low risk offenders as well. "
2291,"Hi Caroline, I definitely agree that more statistical evidence needs to made to generalize the use of the RNR.  The lack of data can be detrimental to PWMI as they can receive the incorrect treatment after being released. As discussed in Skeem et al., (2015) certain risk factor overlap among PWMI and individuals without mental illness. However, using the same treatment for both populations may disregard other risk factors for PWMI. I also agree that more staff that have expertise with mental illness is imperative as they can create more personalized treatment.  As we saw with mental health courts this week, do you think with staff will start to use inter personal type of therapies within jails with appropriate staff  as you suggested as higher number of PWMI are entering the criminal justice system? "
2292,"The lack of support in the prison environment can further aggravate PWMI. As described by Carlos Cervantes a former inmate, he often felt alone and would cry in despair. Additionally, he describes that once prisoners are released, they are offered no services to reintegrate. Furthermore, some individuals may be placed in segregation for 72 hours and I imagine not having any human interaction can further escalate behaviors among PWMI. Additionally, inmates may be subdued and restrained also known as official beatings in which guards would apply to disobedient inmates in solitary confinement. This type types of unnecessary force can further agitate PWMI. As described by one of the correction commissioner Joseph Pont of Maine changing the mentality of the guards is equally important as some may use unnecessary force and give administer punitive punishments. As he conveys their job is not to punish rather it is to change behaviors. "
2293,"I believe that PWMI can be rehabilitated when they receive the adequate amount of resources. I believe the lack of resources gets in the way of not rehabilitating prisoners with mental illness.  For instance, PWMI who are released should be regularly be monitored and followed up with. If PWMI are not followed up after release it can further increase recidivism.  Physicians within the jail system should monitor if PMWI if they are taking the correct medication and if they are taking it. Additionally, they should receive group therapy  and learn how to cope with their behaviors. "
2294,"I can see that solitary confinement can be seen as beneficial to maintain order. Guards may believe that this the correct way to ensure the safety of the person, other inmates and staff. However, solitary confinement is detrimental to the health of the prisoner. Prisoners experience anxiety and once they are released to the population it continues to take a toll on their health. Prisoners take time to adjust to human interaction and are slow  to socialize with other individuals. Thus, the disadvantages of solitary confinement outweigh the advantages.  "
2295,"I feel that spending tax dollars on PWMI in prisons is important. However, funding should be allocated properly. The vast amount of money spent on PWMI in prison does not provide the correct treatment to PWMI. As discussed in the video clip, PWMI continue to suffer from the lack of resources within jails.  Additionally, I believe funding should be allocated within the community to provide prior services to PWMI before entering prisons or jails. States should be proactive and by doing so can decrease the number of PWMI entering the criminal justice system.  Additionally, allocating more resources in the community for PWMI can lower prison costs as it can deter the  number of PWMI entering the criminal justice system.  "
2296,"                As higher number of individuals with mental illness enter prisons and jails, resources should be allocated to give them the treatment they need. PWMI are a disadvantaged group that need more resources allocated to them.  As illustrated by Adams & Ferrandino (2008) changes to the structure of prisons and jails can help reduce behaviors and maintain safety among inmates and staff. For instance, as actuarial methods are being used, these methods ignore other factors that can better treat PWMI in prisons (Adams & Ferrandino, 2008). Additionally as conveyed by Clark, Fisher, & McDougall (1993) actuarial approaches are essential as inmates who enter are assessed upon entrance. However, once assessed there should be continued intakes to see how inmates fare inside prison and be continually assessed as they are released into communities (Adams & Ferrandino, 2008). Assessing PWMI after release is essential as it can lower recidivism and ultimately lower prison costs.  In addition, prison environment is equally important (Adams & Ferrandino, 2008). For instance, Ax et al., (2007) found that certain environments can trigger behaviors among PWMI. Additionally, Carr and his colleagues (2006) found that placing PWMI in certain environments can be counterproductive to treatment plans. For instance, PMWI have greater difficulty socializing as their behavior is peculiar which can result in victimization by other inmates (Adams & Ferrandino, 2008). Thus, placing PWMI in a safe environment is essential as it protects staff and PWMI. Additionally, safe environments can protect the general population from victimization.  Programs like the McNeil have been found to provide the environment and services PWMI need in prison (Adams & Ferrandino, 2008). Thus, the implementation of programs like these can be beneficial. Other programs such as Therapeutic Communities were also found to create a more positive environment for PWMI (Adams & Ferrandino, 2008). Therapeutic Communities have been found to improve the staff and inmate relationship and provide after care once an inmate is released (Adams & Ferrandino, 2008). Furthermore, changing the mentality and training of prison staff is important. Dvoskin & Spiers (2004) created a 4- step approach for correctional officers to participate in treating PWMI by providing counseling (talking with inmates), consultations (talking about inmates), special housing, activities and administe"
2297,"Hi Nicolle, I definitely agree that PWMI should be allocated more resources. As an increased number of PWMI are entering correctional facilities, there is a need to better allocate resources. As you mentioned if more resources would be allocated, it can decrease costs overall. I also believe a key factor in creating more efficiency is to train staff and create a more hands on approach. Training staff would create a better relationship between PWMI and staff along with a safer environment. As mentioned in one of the YouTube clips we saw this week as addressed by the chief corrections officer of Maine, changing the mentality of guards is essential . It promotes safety and lowers victimization on PWMI. "
2298,"Hi Elise, Great post! I definitely agree that more resources should be allocated for PWMI. As you mentioned this can be quite expensive in the beginning however, can ultimately lower costs in the long run. I also believe that resources should be allocated in communities to begin with. This can lower the number of PWMI entering the criminal justice system. I also agree with your recommendation of increased screening. As mentioned by Adams & Ferrandino (2018) continued assessment during  incarceration and post release is essential as its a means of following up and decrease the rates of recidivism. As more actuarial models are being used to assess,  do you think there will an increase in assessment prior to arrest and post release?"
2299,"If I were a taxpayer in Missouri I would support the new Fulton State Hospital. As we have learned psychiatric hospitals are in dilapidated conditions and lack funding. Furthermore, old institutions promote old ways of treatment. However, the Fulton State hospital is taking new forms of treatment such as group therapies. I believe this new hospital is taking a step in the right direction for treating PWMI."
2300,"I do not believe that guilty by reason of insanity is a “get out of jail free card.” Proving insanity is difficult and used in 1 % of cases. Additionally, it is only successful in a quarter of cases. Additionally, if proven insane, individuals are required to serve their sentence in a mental hospital and do not walk free.  Thus, pleading insane is not a “get out of jail free card.”  "
2301,"I believe state hospitals can improve safety by having more staff available. As discussed in the YouTube video hospitals who are short staffed pull staff from the kitchen and have custodians fill in positions. However, these staff are not trained thus, hospitals should have more staff on call and should be trained extensively.  Additionally, staff should be thoroughly trained in crisis de-escalation techniques. Hospitals should also allocate more funding towards having security to monitor patients."
2302,"I believe that deep brain stimulation is a good treatment for depression. Depression affects a majority of individuals and can genetic. Brain stimulation offers a way for individuals to end years of suffering and experience emotions they haven’t felt in years. Brain stimulation is also a great option for those who have exhausted other treatments that have not worked. Additionally, it can prevent some from abusing medication."
2303,"            Fisher et al., (2009) discusses the potential for mental hospitals to be used for treating PWMI. After reading the article, I believe state hospitals should be used to treat PWMI before entering the criminal justice system. Mental health hospitals are capacitated with a significant excess of bed capacity and can be more flexible with the number of individuals they receive (Fisher et al., 2009). Additionally, state hospitals can offer and maintain levels or security and receive a broader range of patients as opposed to private hospitals (Fisher et al., 2009).  Additionally, state hospitals offer community services such as day treatment, employment opportunities, case management, and other services that promote successful community reintegration (Fisher et al., 2009). However, state hospitals do not receive the same funding as general hospitals ((Fisher et al., 2009). State hospitals costs are not covered by Medicaid (Fisher et al., 2009).  As discussed by Fisher et al., (2009) in order to reap the benefits of state hospital they suggest that SMHA officials long with police and judges discuss allocating resources appropriately. Furthermore. Fisher et al., (2009) suggest that funds from Medicaid should be allocated to state hospitals as they can offer more treatment to PWMI than general hospitals. In addition Fisher et al., (2009) suggest that SMHA contract with private hospitals as some state hospitals are not able to adequately provide care to PWMI. Thus, with allocation of resources state hospitals should be used to treat PWMI. Not only state hospitals provide treatment to individuals who voluntary commit but forensic patients as well. I believe that both populations can be served at mental hospitals."
2304,"Hi Caroline, Great post! I definitely agree that state hospitals continue to serve forensic patients. As Fisher et al., (2009) discussed mental hospitals offer services to reintegrate PWMI into the community. However, I also believe that mental hospitals should work with the general population and not only with forensic patients. If state hospitals only work in forensic patients as you discussed, what facilities would serve civil commitments? "
2305,"Hi Asia, Great post! I agree that state hospitals can offer more resources for forensic patients amid negative views.  State hospitals can ensure adequate treatment as opposed to jails or prisons were they face an increased chance of being victimized. Additionally, as we saw in this weeks lectures, new state hospitals are acquiring more staff and community based treatment which can be essential for PWMI to be integrated back to the community. "
2306,"I believe having a data system that links the criminal justice system and mental health systems is a step in the right direction for treating PWMI. For those who are in jails and prisons it can be beneficial as it can let prison and jail staff  know what type of treatment they are taking. Additionally upon release, it can be used to follow up on individuals. Mental health institutions would be able to follow up on clients and further help them successfully reintegrate back to the community. In order to improve links I think there should be other programs that offer treatment such as employment, substance abuse and housing should also be integrated in this to help PWMI reintegrate back into society."
2307,"The CIT approach is different from a routine law enforcement encounter appears different to me as officers took a non-adversarial approach. Additionally, officers asked about the individual if they took any medication, what type and how many. Moreover, officers were empathetic and compassionate as they approached the individual calmly and assured him that everything would be okay, and they understood things could get tough. Furthermore, they directed the individual towards getting an evaluation and family members also received support services. EMT's who are CIT trained can further help calm the situation and reassure the individual everything is okay."
2308,"I think it takes a court order or legal actions to change PWMI treatment because staff is not adequately trained. The inadequate training of staff leads to the mistreatment of PWMI which results in lawsuits from PWMI and families. I believe if staff were adequately trained it wouldn’t lead to lawsuits and legal mandates. Furthermore, as we have learned the lack of awareness of PWMI results in victimization. Therefore, in order for PWMI to be treated humanely, laws and regulations need to be put in place. Additionally, having written laws puts in place sanctions for staff that violate regulation laws."
2309,"Mental health workers face interpersonal challenges. For instance, some prisoners may not be open to treatment. For a prisoner to be open to treatment they must feel that the help they are receiving is genuine and authentic. This is a challenge for workers as they must use creative ways to build relationships with the inmates.  Additionally, they face communication issues as some may be receiving treatment for the first time so, they have try to sell them the idea that there' s a better way of life so treatment works.  Therefore, both the inmate and the mental health worker have to be on the same page so, they achieve their treatment goals.  In addition,  prisoners need to  feel that their clinician is there to help them and not remind them of their short comings. "
2310,"                I believe that adequate training can be beneficial to mental health workers and PWMI. As discussed in Watson & Fulambarker (2012) CIT training is beneficial as mental health workers can better serve PWMI. As we have learned officers are the first ones to come in contact with PWMI in the criminal justice system. Thus, adequate training is essential for officers. However, with receiving little training regarding mental health, officers don’t feel adequate to respond mental health calls (Watson & Fulambarker, 2012). However, CIT training can provide with the adequate training and increase safety when dealing with mental health calls.  Furthermore, CIT training allows officers to be aware of the services available for PWMI which in turn can divert individuals from entering the criminal justice system (Watson & Fulambarker, 2012). Additionally, relationships between officers and mental health officers are improved (Watson & Fulambarker, 2012).  This is key as collaboration between both agencies enhances communication, so the best course of action is taken for PWMI.             Additionally, the appropriate training of correctional staff as demonstrated by Parker (2009) is equally important as well. The study results from Parker (2009) showed that training of correctional officers leads to the decrease of incidents of use of force by officers and battery by bodily waste. This allows us to see that training of officers further ensures safety of both correctional staff and PWMI. As more PWMI enter the criminal justice system it is necessary that all actors continue to receive training in regard to mental health. Training promotes safety, decreases victimization of PWMI, and allows PWMI to receive the treatment they need."
2311,"Hi Stephanie, Great post! I also listed that CIT training is imperative for police officers and mental health providers. I believe that CIT training offers a way to be safely treated and be diverted to community support services. Even though Watson & Fulamabarker state that CIT training has not been found to be statistically significant but deemed as a best practice model for law enforcement. Do you believe CIT training will be mandated instead of voluntary? "
2312,"Hi Danielle, Great post! I also listed as CIT training as beneficial for PWMI. However, as you mentioned the lack of significant data is troubling however, as you said it can't hurt. Additionally, Watson & Fulambarker listed it as a best practice model  thus, inferring that its an ethical approach. So even though it might lack data at best it provides officers to approach PWMI in a safely manner as opposed using unnecessary bodily force. "
2313,"I believe peer mentoring can help lessen the stigma of mental illness as it allows individuals of the community to be mentors. As people in the community become mentors, they can better understand mental health and it can help PWMI feel integrated to the community. Additionally, having a mentor raises awareness that anyone can be affected by mental health issues,  which lessens the stigma."
2314,"I believe that the mental health and substance abuse model described is very beneficial as individuals who have a mental illness also suffer from substance abuse. By these two agencies merging together it better screens, treats and follow ups on individuals. If the justice system would take this approach it would better treat individuals. It would change the way the criminal justice treats co-occurring disorders to working together instead of using different methods that may not work for the individual or in conflict. An integrated system would also create stability as every provider is on the same page for the treatment the individual needs."
2315,"I feel the hurdles that the criminal justice and mental health agencies face are different. Mental health providers are always looking for the best evidence programs constantly. They need to make sure any new measures they implement provide evidence-based results and make sure results can be generalized. The criminal justice system faces the issue of having appropriate staff, training and budget issues when implementing evidence-based methods. They need to make sure they have the right tools to implement new initiatives. "
2316,"I feel that diversion efforts as the one in Fairfax focus on non- violent offenders because they  might be easier to handle. Officers may believe that non- violent offenders may be more open to treatment and easier to talk to. Additionally, it makes it easier for officers to divert them to a wrap around program. I feel that violent offenders should be taken in for an evaluation assessment and proceed to creating a treatment plan after evaluation."
2317,"                    The implementation of the recommendations would affect the way behavioral health care and primary health care would be involved.  The American College of Physicians recommend that these two entities should integrate to improve treatment, reduce heath care costs and lessen mental health stigma. As mental health and psychical conditions intermingle, integrating both services create a better treatment and quality of life (Crowley & Kirschner, 2015). Furthermore, as these entities integrate it changes the way individuals are treated. As Crowley & Kirschner (2015) discusses treatment would treat the whole person. Thus, primary care providers would provide treatment for both physical and behavioral health needs.  However, as primary care providers change their services, it would have an impact on insurance payments and coverage gaps thus, individuals will have insurance coverage through their primary provide. Furthermore, by integrating both fields the way patients are screened changes.  Primary health caregivers would be able to provide services from the start. The implementation of these changes would change how individuals with mental illness are approached by the criminal justice system. For instance, the integration of both fields would allow individuals to receive treatment from a primary provider rather than going to a mental health provider at additional costs.  This shift would help individuals to get treatment faster and additionally would be covered by insurance and Medicaid. Additionally, this integration would better keep records of mental health treatment. As both entities work in collaboration, those who enter the criminal justice system would have a treatment file. As we have learned this is crucial as it can help provide treatment in correction facilities. This further helps get individuals get identified and receive the treatment they need. Lastly, having the integration of both fields would better the outcomes of individuals with mental illness. As they would receive treatment faster by a primary caregiver, it can further help divert individuals form the criminal justice system. As we have learned in past lectures, receiving treatment can help individuals who suffer from mental illness from entering the criminal justice system."
2318,"Hi Elise, Great post! I also agree with your findings. The integration of both agencies will definitely help towards diverting individuals from the criminal justice system. Additionally, I liked how you mentioned that it will help lessen stigma from the start as it would bring awareness. One thing I failed to think about I'm glad you did is the impact it can have on children. Not only would it lessen stigma from a young age but it will also help them to be aware of mental illness and maybe even notice the signs of mental illness. This would be great as they might be able to their peers who might suffering from a mental illness. "
2319,"Hi Briana, Great post! I definitely believe that the integration of both agencies can help individuals get better treatment and reduce their involvement with the criminal justice system. You also mentioned that upon release individuals would have less difficulties filling their prescriptions. However, as we have talked in the past lectures upon incarceration, individuals lose their access to Medicaid thus, do you think they should implement a service that provides them back with these benefits after release?"
2320,The case of Timothy Souders death seems to be one filled with untrained eyes consistently making terrible decisions. The idea to restrain Souders from the start sounded like one of the first major bad decisions in how to handle his situations. Though the director of the prison states that the restraints were not used for punishment according to the documents this was done as a reaction to Souders trying to flood his room. The next major point that stuck out to me was when a social worker recommended that he go to a hospital to receive help but the paperwork was never completed in time to do this. I believe that had the advice of the social worker been taken the prison may have been able to prevent Souders death to get him the help he needed and maybe another third party's advice on how to handle him. 
2321,"One of the earliest examples of non-medical considerations driving treatment is the belief that demons were taking over victims and making them mentally ill. This lead to using laxatives to ""purge"" these demons or in surgery to expose the brain to allow for the evil spirits to be ""cleansed."" Even in the Insane Asylums in the 19th century, non-medical beliefs like how women should act and what she should or should not say drove women to be institutionalized for asking for a divorce or for questioning political decisions. Non-medical considerations have dominantly driven how we treat the mentally ill when you look at the entirety of its history.   "
2322,"I don't believe that creating a national registry of mentally ill persons would significantly reduce gun violence. The likelihood of someone with a mental illness is already incredibly low so any positive hits we'd make with a registry would be pretty small compared to pouring in time, energy, and funds into other solutions to reducing gun violence. Funding more research into guns and allowing research about guns should be one of the first steps we take in order to help understand the gun violence issue better. "
2323,"I think the most important problem to fix would be providing them with mental health services to receive treatment (either medicine or therapy) to navigate the changes in their lives. Reintegration into society can be overwhelming and helping them understand the intricacies of social interactions and expectations of a workplace or in a friendship can be daunting if they have been removed or have never been able to understand their own struggles. Being able to understand their own illness will allow them to understand what they need out of their environment to be a functional employee, partner, and friend. "
2324,"The view on mental illness has mostly surrounded the thought that mental illness has victimized an individual. In Pre-Civilization times, tribal groups attributed the illness to evil spirits that the family then had to take care of. In Ancient Civilizations, mental illness was thought to be something that had to be purged out of the body through laxatives or surgery. In the Middle Ages, mental illness was viewed as evil or doomed spirits possessing a victim. These perspectives all attribute mental illness as this outside thing that has plagued the soul/body of a human and now must be cared for by someone else. As Szasz's reading points out we traditionally view persons with mental illness as a victim rather than an active member of society.  I believe that our victimization of persons with mental illness has allowed us to wrongfully control their narrative. In Julie Beck's article about gun violence and mental illness, she points out how the narrative surrounding persons of mental illness as violent is not based on the reality of how many actually commit a violent crime. Only 4% of violent crime is committed by a person with a mental illness and even within that not every case has a gun involved. In addition to the low percentage of violent crime done by persons with mental illness, the fear of gun violence to another person is less likely than gun violence against themselves. Even with these statistics, Beck cited that research shows that reading stories that implicate mental illness in a mass shooting crime leads people to have more negative feelings towards persons with mental illnesses.  Seeing them as victims has further pushed the idea that they do not have self-control and have allowed our perspective and decisions surrounding persons with mental illness to try to ""save"" them rather than ""serve"" them. The TED talk from the lecture perfectly demonstrates how to ""serve"" individuals with mental illness. Crystal Dieleman points out that to help  persons who are mentally ill they need things like employment, housing, and having a community. These are all things that full-fledged members of society have. When we view them as victims, full-integration seems like something we shouldn't allow or expect them to do when in reality it's exactly what needs to happen. "
2325,"Hi Gabby,  I like that you pointed out how 5150 and 5250 are are examples of how we imply that we cannot trust certain people with mental illnesses to take care of themselves. I also like that you acknowledge the importance of these and how they do serve to protect the public. I agree that we are still trying to find the balance between protecting PWMI, the public, and allowing PWMI life lives as active members of society.  I believe the first major step is exactly what you said, not leaving the treatment of PWMI in the hands of the criminal justice system. The criminal justice system is not well equipped to properly care for PWMI. We also get shift our views on what ""care"" means for PWMI. PWMI simply requires more support but their need for more support shouldn't keep us from thinking that they can't contribute to society. As Dieleman pointed out in her TED Talk the best care for PWMI tend to be care that incorporates reintegration into society."
2326,"Hi Nicole,  I was interested to find out that violence in PWMI was only 4%, I thought that it would be low but it ended up being LOWER than I anticipated. I think that I too was impacted by the perceptions that sensationalized stories in the media put out. As you pointed out, that article actually stated that those who are mentally ill and commit a violent offense with guns tend to be because of suicide. I like that the article demonstrated the real gun violence concern with PWMI are suicide concerns instead of homicide. These are known statistics and you pointed out what we don't know scares us. It's unfortunate that this isn't the narrative that we hear about in the media especially when a mass shooting has occurred. I think that its this misinterpretation that makes the public believe that PWMI cannot be active contributors to society just as thought when more people believed that they were being possessed by demons. It's important that we look at how public opinion is either hurting or helping PWMI.  As you said it the stigma surrounding mental illness that affects our willingness and as much as we expect PWMI to work on their mental illness we should also work on our biases. "
2327,President has a significant impact on the culture of American people during their presidency. I believe that speaking about the stigma surrounding mental illness and its false claims allows for this issue to brought to the forefront of minds and engage in important discussions on how to help end the stigma. It is also important to hear out the input of activist and professionals that work with PWMIs along with PWMIs themselves allows for us as a people and democracy to be more informed on what we can do to help minimize this stigma. 
2328,"Reducing benefits for mental health care elicits that policymakers don't see much worth in mental health care over other types of health care that are physically seen. Even with the benefits that mental care has or had they still need so much more, therefore, taking away what they currently have is further demonstrating that it is not an utmost priority. Policymakers are indirectly saying that those who require assistance because of mental illness are also not worth supporting. "
2329,I would push for more resources for active military as well as veterans to be able to go to therapy and receive a diagnosis outside of just filling out a service. I would also recommend organizing group sessions for military members to be able to find a community within the military to help support each other through whatever they are facing. It's a great way to build a network of people that can relate closely to what they are going through. 
2330,"Mandating treatment for PWMI would be tricky because PWMI should still have the independence to make decisions for themselves but at the same time, they may be unable to recognize what those around them are seeing. It is also tricky because if a PWMI has a substance abuse disorder forcing them to get treatment may not be successful because a significant factor to success in substance abuse programs is the desire to want to succeed, something that may not surface if they are forced. I'm not entirely sure about where I land on this because I don't want to overstep on PWMIs' rights but there are times where the dangerousness to themselves needs to be acknowledged. I would lean more to a side where if the dangerousness to themselves is starting to become dangerous for others they should be required to get treatment. "
2331,"As many of us have learned this week stigma related to PWMI has significantly impacted this community whether it be financially, socially, or emotionally. Stigma towards PWMI is heavily ingrained in some of our beliefs and perspectives on how functioning and how dangerous PWMI are. It's important that in order to combat these stigmas that these topics are introduced in our educational system as early as possible. In elementary schools, I think that a great way to teach skills critical to combating stigma would be through social-emotional learning (SEL). SEL curriculum help equip students and teachers with the skills needed to promote inclusion and increase levels of compassion; two things that could help students with mental illness feel like a part of their school community. Implementing new curriculum into classrooms may be overwhelming for classroom teachers but SEL curriculum should be implemented during their Physical Education classes. This is the least structured environment currently in our educational system and SEL curriculum could better introduce through playing different activities and team sports. I believe that it is also important to make sure that students who have extra needs because of mental illnesses are integrated with neurotypical students otherwise students with mental illnesses will continue to be considered “other” and will be kept from being part of a solution for a problem that directly impacts them.  As students enter middle school and high school their science/health classes should all have a section on mental illness to take a deeper dive into what it means to have schizophrenia or to have depression. Middle school is also the time where some students start to undergoing developmental changes that can sometimes be accompanied by mood swings which would benefit students to learn about the biological explanation behind what they are currently going through. SEL curriculum should not stop in elementary school though, this curriculum should continue throughout high school because the interpersonal skills achieved in SEL curriculum are things that need to be continuously worked on. We must consider these skills as a muscle and if you don't keep working out that muscle then you will lose it. Especially since students will be transitioning into new schools with new dynamics finding ways to work together and know when to respect other boundaries will continue to be a great learning curve. SEL curriculum can also be used to"
2332,"Hi Jen,  Your point highlighting what former President Obama said about mental and physical ailments are both things no one should feel ashamed about visiting a doctor is extremely important! Leaving things untreated only allow things to get worse. I think it's important that mental health services are highlighted as just as important as physical health and it's even more important that this is reflective in insurance policies for mental health coverage. Both should have the same amount of coverage in insurance plans to ensure that people can afford to look for help for mental illnesses. Since mental illnesses tend to be ""invisible"" it becomes the easier thing to ignore if you cannot afford to go to the doctor as often as you need to, leading you to pick and choose what you receive help for. Alleviating the stigma is important and we should make sure that what we are promoting is not impossible for families to pursue. "
2333,"Hi Natalie,  Thank you for sharing your personal experience with this topic! It's something that resonates personally as well. You bought up interesting points about a families' influence on mental health perspectives, I think that accompanying education for students there should also be some after school (or during school) workshops/training for parents to also educate them on mental illnesses. Appropriately discussing these topics with parents/legal guardians of children would help make sure students are getting support not only at their schools but also at home. I realize that it might be hard to get parents to show up an event the school has organized but I think this is an integral part of ensuring that we are holistically trying to combat the stigma surrounding mental health.  It would also be a great way to bond the school administration with parents/legal guardians to ease future issues that may arise between them. "
2334,"In regards to civil commitment decisions, false-positive would represent those who were found to be a danger to themselves or others but turned out not to be and a false-negative would be someone who was not found to be a danger to themselves or others and were not committed. For civil commitment decisions you'd want to prioritize sensitivity to ensure that people who are a danger to themselves or others are being committed but that does run the risk of having false positives. False positives, in this case, would mean committing someone who did not need to be committed and infringing on their rights which would be troubling for society in a different way than if you have a false negative. "
2335,Intuitively I want to say yes but taking what I learned in Psychology and the Law last year I know that sex offender are least likely to re-offend. If sex offenders require extra treatment that should be stated in their original sentencing. Part of their sentencing should require some evaluation to determine their risk level of reoffending and if they fail this evaluation then they must be committed for further treatment but this should be made clear at their sentencing. Issues will still arise with this scenario but it's tricky to figure out how much we should prioritize public safety or individual rights.  
2336,"If improperly used then it is a large reach of state authority. I believe that someone must demonstrate great danger for themselves or others in order to be committed, especially be considered for inpatient commitment. Inpatient commitment must be for the most certain and extreme patients. I like that outpatient allows the patient to remain part of the outside community and believe that it is a fair balance for those who it is appropriate for. I think that in order for these types of commitments to not be overreaching, we should be okay with more false negatives than false positives. Though the goal is to commit those who need the extra help if begins to commit individuals who do not need to be committed it may result in more negative results than positive. If we have too many false positives in inpatient commitment this could greatly impact their employment status which could lead to negative consequences as serious as homelessness that later resulted in all kinds of negative health outcomes. I'm interested in finding information on the socio-economic class distribution of individuals in each type of commitment. I assume that we will see more lower SES but it would be interested to see how many individuals who are high SES are subjected to these commitments."
2337,"The goal of inpatient and outpatient involuntary commitment is to provide treatment to individuals who need it and without it may harm themselves or others. A benefit to these two types of involuntary commitment is that it alleviates families and/or friends from having to find or provide care for someone's mental health needs. According to this week's lecture videos, supporters of outpatient commitment have cited that there is an increased rate for medical compliance, in likelihood to engage in further treatment after outpatient commitment, and those with severe psychiatric illness who have been committed are likely to enjoy a better quality of life once commitment ends. Critics believe that the statute is unconstitutional and coercive because of forced treatment that at times can include medication. Courts will also use ""contempt"" against noncompliant patients to  Though the statute has been challenged in court,  courts find that the statute is not unconstitutional. Other critics also point out that African Americans are much more likely to be committed than any other population.  It seems like not one side of the argument is obviously the most ""correct"" side but I do lean more on the belief that inpatient and outpatient involuntary commitment is more beneficial to society than it hurts society. Swanson's et al.'s paper focused on the criticism that African Americans are much more likely (specifically in New York) to involuntarily committed to outpatient care. Swason et al. argues that the racial disparity in involuntary outpatient care commitments is a result of drawing from a population that African Americans are overrepresented in. Swason et al. also cites that outpatient commitments help reduce hospitalizations and reduced the risk of violent behavior and victimization, points that were also cited in the lecture. Their study found that when the denominators used were the number of estimated black and white individuals who have a severe mental illness, the frequency shrunk. Though I believe that these involuntary commitments serve to benefit us more than harm us I would still advocate for appropriate analysis of either their success or lack thereof.  I believe that these programs should prioritize having very few false positives in order to insure that it is not infringing on someone's rights. In order to measure the success of these programs research should measure employment, education, self-reported quality of life, and continued"
2338,"Hi Alyse,  I think your distinction about inpatient care being for those who really need to be under care for 24/7 is an important point to highlight. As we learned in Crystal Dieleman's TED talk from Week One, an important way to help those with mental illness is to integrate them into the community. Outpatient care allows for treatment without removing anyone from society. When considering anyone for inpatient care we should be certain that removing this person temporarily from society is beneficial because they are a severe danger to themselves or others, individuals like Cho. I'm not sure if I missed this in the reading but any individual who we are unsure of whether they should be inpatient or outpatient should be assessed as an inpatient then reevaluated a few weeks into the treatment.  It's interesting to read about how all states differ at some capacity of their requirements for inpatient and outpatient care but we should start to evaluate each state's success and see which states have more positive results that might indicate a way to assess to implement treatment for all states. The needs and demographics of each state may differ but it would be worth knowing if there are any consistent similarities between all states' methods and results of involuntary commitment.       "
2339,"Hi Asia,  I really enjoyed the ideas that you presented in your post. I think your point on educating individuals on their mental illness is extremely important. Last week we discussed the stigma surrounding mental illness and a consistent theme I saw in last week's discussion was using education to reduce the stigma. Sometimes getting treatment can seem like a scary thing because we don't fully understand what that process is and we're scared of the unknown. Focusing on educating patients about their mental illness while also educating them on the treatment methods that have shown to improve this mental illness would most likely improve the success of involuntary commitment. In my post, I focused on how treatment benefits society and your last point about society's seeing those in treatment as recovering and healing individuals seems to focus on how society can help those who are in treatment. I'm not sure if this was your intention but it did make me consider the importance of all of us (society) being an integral part of helping these individuals succeed in receiving treatment. Our stigma on mental health makes treatment seem like this scary or weak avenue people take which causes people to avoid it. We need to work on combating the stigma in order to help support those who need treatment to embrace it rather than run away from it. "
2340,"I think that the prosecution and pretrial part of the criminal process would be the most difficult part for PWMI to navigate. I think that it is a high-stress part that would confuse PWMI as it also confuses neurotypical individuals. The legal process and jargon can be overwhelming to navigate and try to understand and having to deal with preliminary hearings or grand juries would be extremely stressful and overstimulating. Plus, there is still a lot left unknown in this part of the process and no perfect way of figuring out how much longer you have to wait and go through this part of the process in order to find out if you will be sentenced or released. They are also isolated from people they know or are comfortable around and now must trust a stranger with their livelihood, something that is hard for anyone to do regardless of mental illnesses. "
2341,"The benefit that PWMI might achieve with the changes in California corrections is that with Prop 57 they may have more opportunities to participate in activities that have a rehabilitative focus which could help them equip skills needed to better cope with their current situation. Not only may the access skills that could benefit them but it will also go towards reducing their time within a facility. As this lecture section has pointed out, realignment did reduce prison population but it also took mental health services that offenders might have access to in prisons away from them when moved to county jail. Since our health care system outside of prisons and jails is a costly venture when PWMI are released from prisons that offer these services or are moved to counties that do not have these services they are not being with mental health care that is needed in order to cope with being incarcerated and also gaining skills that will prevent them from re-entering the prison or jail.  As Susan Burton points out in the video above, even though these reforms are successfully reducing prison population it isn't necessarily hitting on the reasons that lead to higher prison populations like lack of mental health treatment.  "
2342,"I do not think it is fair that police officers with little to no training about how to process and deescalate interactions with PWMI are first responders to these situations.  I know that police get extensive training on a plethora of topics but knowing that some get little to no training on this topic, in particular, is troubling. As Officer Friend stated in the video above when you can teach officers to speak calmly, listening, and emphasize more often than not they can deescalate the intense situations.  I think that police officers should view themselves as crime fighters and service providers because in many (if not all) emergency scenarios they are showing up to help whether that be fighting crime or helping deescalate a situation. To make this scenario fair I would say that we need to relook at how we train our officers on the topic of mental illness and how to process these situations when they are out in the field. "
2343,"CIT can be used to help reduce the stigma that PWMI face. CIT Training focuses on teaching police officers how to calmly talk, listen, and empathize with PWMI.  Empathy and communication are two factors that can contribute to reducing stigma. Police also subscribe to a similar stigma that the general population does about PWMI, they are unable to reason with and are inherently violent. Even though they subscribe to the same stigma as the general public, police have been found to be more empathetic with PWMI than the general public. This shows that they are a great avenue to help further teach them how to use that empathy to eliminate the stigma that endangers PWMI. CIT works to train on communication skills that open dialogue in order to de-escalate intense situations between police officers and citizens. Using CIT training there is room for more understanding that police and everyone else needs in order to help combat stigma. "
2344,I'm familiar with both! 
2345,"The finding from the Taheri reading shows that evaluating the effectiveness of CIT implementation in police departments requires more research and deeper considerations into what kind of methods are used in evaluating the impact of CIT. The Taheri reading raises the point that it is hard to conclude anything about the effectiveness of CIT training and does not advocate for halting the implementation but advocates for revamping evaluations of the program by using match controls, treatment groups, pre and post interviews, and clearly defining what a “CIT-related” incident is. I believe that these are all suggestions that would benefit evaluating the true impact of CIT. I would not advocate for stopping the use of the CIT model because though some of the suggestions Taheri raises are valid, this meta-analysis does not provide convincing evidence that there is a benefit from stopping CIT. It is also not the intention of this meta-analysis to advocate for the stop of CIT training but for more research on its impact. It is important to continue implementing CIT training because its goals are focused on ensuring officer safety,  reducing unnecessary arrest in PWMI, improving understanding of mental illnesses in police officers, increase crisis intervention communication skills, and a variety of other goals focused on improving officers and PWMI’s interactions. Continuing this program is important to our ability to studying its impact and ensuring that its cost of implementation is producing favorable results. With more research that takes Taheri’s suggestions, I believe we would be able to weigh out its importance. Even if with more research we find out that it is not making an impact it is an important step towards trying to solve problems in our criminal justice system when it comes to the disproportionate amount of PWMI who interact with it. Future research will allow us to evaluate how to enhance CIT training to work for both police officers and PWMI if it is not doing that already. It sets an example that programs like CIT do have a place in law enforcement training and it sets a pathway for other programs to equip police officers with necessary de-escalation skills. Acknowledging the importance of these skills could also help with police officer interactions with other populations that may need de-escalation more than punishment. Though implementing this training can be costly to police departments results are not conclusive enough yet to"
2346,"Hi Asia,  I also suggested continuing the use of CIT training until we know more about its impact. It is hard to make a confident decision based on 8 studies that individually have their own limitations. You pointed out that even though there was no clear evidence on  CIT training reducing arrest there was some evidence of police officers referring more PWMI to mental health facilities. The continuation of this program is important because we wouldn't be able to study its long term effects if it ceases to exist. I'm not sure if I missed this in the reading but I would have like to know how long CIT training had been implemented in the police departments that were in the 8 studies.  I would be interested to see if the amount of time CIT training has been around would be a significant factor in the results of all 8 studies. It would interesting to know if these studies were all done with police departments that have had it for less than a year or for 5 years. This could be an additional suggestion to the several that Taheri had in their paper. "
2347,"Hi Janee,  Your point about making this training mandatory is the first time I've considered how this would look. The textbook mentioned that police officer who has been in law enforcement for longer tend to be ideal candidates because they are more equipped to implement CIT training because they have become more confident in their ability than officers who are new to the force. I think that making this training mandatory should happen after there is a randomized trial that assigns some officers to CIT training and others who do not. This way we will be able to see if there is a direct benefit to having specifically CIT training. I think that training on de-escalation techniques especially with PWMI needs to be pursued but we must be sure that CIT training is providing police officers with these skills before everyone is mandated and I believe a randomized trial would allow us to make a more conclusive argument to make this training mandatory. I really appreciate your points on this topic."
2348,"For starters, i can't begin to imagine how overwhelming this would be to go through as a neurotypical individual. Trying to cope with being arrested and jailed more than 100 times while also coping and dealing with a mental illness would skyrocket the level of stress.  The constant instability of being in and out of the system would most likely be a significant stressor and trigger even if they receive help when they enter a jail it's only temporary care. The lack of any stability, the feeling of belonging, and the support system would worsen the conditions of their mental illness. This never-ending cycle would seem like a spiral of misery that continues to worsen as time goes on. "
2349,"Three key indicators that jails should measure about mental illness should be mortality rates, returns to the hospital, and health status. These three indicators will give jail staff a better pulse on the status of inmates' physical and mental health. It will allow them to see where the system needs to improve to ensure that offenders are being properly taken care of especially in regards to their mental state. These are also measures that show the 'visual' impact of mental illnesses as mental illnesses are 'invisible' but looking overall health status, mortality rates, and returns to hospitals will allow for more understanding of the real negative impacts mental illnesses that are not being properly treated. Mortality rates are an indicator that something needs to be urgently because regardless of the offender's crime they should not be dying within our jails.  These three indicators are also closely related which the video recommended doing in order to be able to see the bigger picture about the quality of care. "
2350,I think that jail inmates do have a fair amount of rights but I do wonder how many inmates are fully aware of their rights. I think that it could be possible that their rights are not being fully respected in the facility and they might not know or understand what they are entitled to. I would definitely not say that they had too many because the rights they still have are rights that all people in this country should have. I think the importance is on our awareness of these rights and actually putting them into action. The one thing that did stick out to me is that there is no requirement of an adversarial hearing in order to provide treatment against an offender's will. I think that this needs to be implemented immediately as decisions such as these should go through a formal process. 
2351,"Even though medication cost is the largest percentage of jails' budgets I think its the most commonly used because it can be the easiest one to administer and feel like you could be improving an individual's health. I think that there is a priority on quick fixes, not to say that medication is not important but being able to fix something with a pill may be more manageable than having to figure out how to get an offender treatment with reoccurring sessions. Alternative ways of administering mental health services take more time and manpower. I think that medication can be an important step for PWMI but it is not the whole solution to helping them recover and learn to function with their mental illness. "
2352,"Realignment allowed California to significantly reduce its prison population at the cost of moving more responsibility and offenders into county jails. The jail population increased and the max sentencing in jails went from one year to five years. Realignment not only increased the population of jails but also the amount of PWMI in these jails. This influx of offenders and longer sentences created worse conditions and thinned county jails’ budget to provide care for their inmates. Overcrowding results in increased violence, shortage of beds, and limiting offenders’ access to different resources; greatly impact the jail’s ability to offer proper care to PWMI. These issues make the already difficult jail experience much harder to cope with for PWMI. PWMI are at a higher risk of relapsing and being abused, these environmental conditions can also trigger symptoms of their mental illness such as manic or depressive states. If these things happen, jails are not always properly equipped with the facilities and trained staff needed to provide necessary care to PWMI. Therefore, using jails for the seriously mentally ill is an inappropriate practice in the context of funding, architectural, and operational constraints. Proper care for inmates is an 8 th amendment right that was protected in the Estelle v. Gamble hearing. A jail’s inability to provide proper care to inmates violates this right. In Torrey et al. (2010), San Francisco saw a 77% increase in needs for mental health services. The funding needed to provide these mental health services did not change as much as the need. The facilities that PWMI must reside in are not appropriate living arrangements. The constraints and overcrowding are stressors that when not appropriately cared for by mental health services can trigger actions and behavior from PWMI that are less favorable.  The importance of offering proper care is incredibly important considering that nearly a fifth of inmates have some sort of serious mental illness (Torrey et al., 2010). These serious mental illness include bipolar disorders and schizophrenia, that are ideally treated with the use of medication and routine therapy. The need to uplevel the care for PWMI that are incarcerated is urgent. I believe that in order to be able to provide this care PWMI who are incarcerated should be treated in facilities that are equipped to handle their needs and provide the help that will rehabilitate them to understand their m"
2353,"Hi Suzanna,  I like that you touched upon that having a serious mental illness alone is already a challenging experience but when you couple that with being incarcerated it can increase the level of stressors PWMI face. Inmates who do not have serious mental illness struggle in our criminal justice system so expecting PWMI to be able to handle jails seem to be an overextension. I think that it's important that staff be trained to be more understanding of mental health and they should be equipped with certain skills that help them de-escalate situations with PWMI.  Their training should be similar to the training that CIT does for police officers. This training should help reduce the stigma that many people have about PWMI and lowering this stigma will begin to open doors for better care.  It has to be a community effort to ensure that PWMI are receiving care that they are entitled to by their 8th amendment right. "
2354,"Hi Clara,  I also had a similar stance in which I believe that it is important that they are still being held accountable for the crimes they have committed. I think that it is important for jails to have resources like trained staff and facilities that are appropriate to take care of the inmates with serious mental illnesses for this reason. The goal of sending them to jail is that they will understand the consequences of their punishment and that will lead them to make better decisions next time that will not lead to them being incarcerated. If inmates who have a serious mental illness do not have the proper services to help them understand and work towards becoming an effective member of society that they will enter the cycle of coming back into these jails once they are released. Though it can be costly to provide these resources, it is more costly to have someone coming back into prisons and being continuously resentenced.  It's important that we invest funds to ensure that our jails are equipped with these resources to make that we are respecting the rights of the inmates and ensuring that our society is being protected and improved upon when an inmate is released. "
2355,I think that it could still be fair as long as everyone involved in the decision-making process is educated and reminded of its likelihood for accuracy. It shouldn't be used as a sole decision-maker but I believe it is appropriate if it is used emphasizes evidence that is more significantly conclusive and accurate.  I think that if a decision is driven by the risk assessment tool alone than the court needs to be provided with more evidence and cannot alone determine anything just by the results of a risk assessment tool because of its potential to be inaccurate. 
2356,"Mental health professionals would be receptive to the RNR approach in dealing with PWMI in the justice system because it also highlights the importance of treating the individual and environmental factors that can lead to crime. Mental illness is not the sole blame for why someone commits a crime, RNR takes a more holistic approach at reducing recidivism that I think mental health professionals would be more pleased with. I think that we should also be concerned with looking at the mortality rates of PWMI under supervision in the community to ensure that treatment is increasing their quality of life. "
2357,I do not think that probation is completely set up to address the supervision and treatment of PWMI. Their probation officers need to be trained on working with PWMI and as the textbook recommends this should be an annual 40-hour total training. The needs of PWMI will differ from other offenders and probation officer need to be equipped with the right skills and resources to offer these to them. I do think that it may be more equipped than jail is to treat a PWMI but there are still improvements that need to be made. I think it is more possible to get training for probation officers on how to work with PWMI than it is to think that jails would get their entire staff similar training and give PWMI access to some of the needed and costly resources. 
2358,"I believe I would prefer to go through the mental health court because a traditional court setting would be far more overwhelming than the mental health court which is more informal and commonsenesical, unlike traditional court which is legalistic and formal. The mental health court also focuses on therapeutic jurisprudence which if I'm low income would be something that I could not have afforded to pursue before then. I think that I may feel initially frustrated as a participant in the mental health court in having to participate in the extensive plan the court hands but at the end of the process, I'd be thankful to be able to seek rehabilitation in that way. The traditional court may lead me into a cycle of being reincarcerated because I would not have received the treatment needed to help me deal with my illness and build a better life. "
2359,"The Risk-Need-Responsive (RNR) model assesses an offender’s level of risk, their needs, and what type of environment the offender can be placed in that will result in a reduction of recidivism. Ultimately, the main goal of this model is to reduce recidivism rates. This type of model can provide PWMI with a fighting chance at avoiding recidivism due to its holistic approach to rehabilitating an offender. This model allows for PWMI to obtain a different type of probation that could not only help alleviate symptoms of their mental illness but also diminish environmental factors that contribute to recidivism. Skeem et al.’s (2017) paper found that traditional probationers, compared to specialty mental health probationers are twice as likely to be rearrested. Specialty mental health probation can provide treatment for low socioeconomic PWMI and allows a court to hold managed care authorities in contempt of court if they fail to follow through with treatment orders. Mental health treatment initially may sound costly but, in a study, done by Ridgley et al. (2007) found that mental health courts that allow these types of probation saved nearly $10,000 per participant which adds up to about $500,000 of savings in over 2 years.  Specialty mental health probation is a promising solution to reducing the number of PWMI who are incarcerated. My guidance to the Chief Probation Officer about the supervision of MI on probation would be to not ensure that PWMI are being treated through therapy and medication but also ensuring their functionality as a citizen is also improving. Providing PWMI with skills needed to not only manage their mental health symptoms but also effectively exists in society will help alleviate the pressures of environmental factors that would hinder their treatment and/or push them towards committing a crime. These environmental factors include but are not limited to; homelessness, abusive partners or family members, lack of a support system, and unemployment. These types of risk factors could lead low-risk offenders into recommitting which is why it is important that the Chief Probation Officer should b cautious about only allowing high-risk offenders to participate in this type of probation. PWMI are far more likely to struggle with homelessness, substance abuse problems, and physical abuse. These issues can lead them into committing petty crimes and if the Chief Probation Officer focuses only on high-risk offenders, then low-risk offender"
2360,"Hi Tamara,  I liked your final point about how increasing surveillance of a mentally ill offender will not produce the same results as treatment plans and the involvement of probation officers with PWMI.  As pointed out in the lecture this week, these treatment plans can be rigorous but simply requiring surveillance of the offender will not suffice in reducing recidivism rates. Probation officers are put into a role as a social worker as the building of an appropriate relationship is important in ensuring these treatment plans are completed. You tying in CIT training was a great way of demonstrating the type of training probation officers would need in order to better understand the needs and struggles of PWMI. This allows for the creation of appropriate treatment plans with realistic expectations that ultimately result in positive results for the offender and society at large. I really enjoyed reading through your post and you equipped me with more points on how to strengthen my own argument on this topic. "
2361,"Hi Amber,  I appreciate you pointing out the weak spots of the claims surrounding RNR. This is definitely something a Chief Probation Officer should also know in order to better defend the model if they wanted to move forward with it. I would say that even with these limitations I would still advocate for the use of the RNR model in order for researchers to be able to create more sophisticated and significant findings of the model. I wonder if you would advise the Chief Probation Officer to move forward with this model? Even if we come to find out that it does not show a significant improvement it can still be a stepping stone in a better direction when it comes to the treatment of PWMI in our criminal justice system. I would advise the Cheif Probation Officer to work with researchers in allowing the model to function in a manner that would increase the generalizability of researchers' findings and allow for random selection within screened offenders. Though this may seem 'unfair' to those who qualify it would allow for the findings to be more significant and could positively impact thousands of PWMI in the future. "
2362,"The prison environment has several conditions that can aggravate the condition of PWMI.  The aggressive attitudes of prison officers and other inmates can especially be triggering when trying to deal with the fear of entering a new environment. It can be hard for neurotypical inmates to find a support system but the stigma that surrounds PWMI adds an extra hurdle to them building a relationship that will help them deal with a prison environment. PWMI are also not around familiar people to help them cope with the transition into a prison environment which can cause them to isolate themselves in order to try to feel safe.  These triggering factors can lead them to react in unfavorable ways in a prison environment that could lead officers to isolate the PWMI which is another aspect of the prison environment that can aggravate the condition of PWMI. Their way of coping can be considered disobedient and the officers may see this as a  reason to punish them in order to get them to be obedient.  Punishment cannot be effective if PWMI do no understand what they did, why what they did was bad, or what the punishment is for. "
2363,"I believe that prisoners with mental illnesses can be truly rehabilitated. I think that the belief that a prisoner cannot be rehabilitated is because our current prison system does not support rehabilitation at the level it needs to be and there is a failure to access mental health care outside of the prison system.  The environment that we as a society have created and accepted is failing inmates with mental illness in providing opportunities and an environment to be rehabilitated. As the video pointed out, it is still important that people serve time for crimes they have committed but it is also important that they are able to reintegrate into society upon release. This means that they must go back out into society better than how they came into prison. Our current system is punitive which is not entirely beneficial when you consider trying to educate and rehabilitate inmates with mental illnesses on how to behave once out of prison. I think that a prisoner with a mental illness can be rehabilitated if provided with therapeutic, social, and sometimes medicinal ways or treating their mental illness and that this process does not end once they are released.  Prisons (and all citizens) should be able to access and afford medical care at any point in their lives, both physical and mental. With these things in place, PWMI who reenter society can be better equipped to be rehabilitated. "
2364,"Though solitary confinement makes the prison staff feel more in control, safer, and able to keep order; I don't believe these temporary advantages outweigh the disadvantages it creates for inmates. The advantages are solely for the prison staff but this does not help the inmate's ability to be reintegrated in our society or even with other prisoners.  Alternatives to solitary confinement must be found that still help prison staff remain order in the prisons while also not further debilitating the inmate. Instead of throwing an inmate into solitary confinement, prisons should limit their socializing time to participate in specific activities offered by the prison. These inmates that originally would be put into solitary confinement can be required to take on tasks that will keep them busy and away from other inmates involved in the situation that got them in trouble in the first place. The long-term effects of solitary confinement outweigh the short-term benefits it provides to the staff. "
2365,I am supportive of using my tax dollars to treat mentally ill persons in prison. I think that this ultimately beneficial for myself and my community as it ensures that someone can get treatment that will allow them to one day be able to contribute to society once they have been rehabilitated and it will also help one more person not enter into a cycle of crime that could endanger the wellbeing of myself and my community. I am lucky enough to have been born into a position of privilege where i do not have to deal with the symptoms of having a mental illness like bipolar or schizophrenia and using my tax dollars to provide services for them that will allow them to have a shot at reentry society seems fair to me. I realize that these individuals have committed a crime but I also believe that there are other factors that are not intrinsic that push an individual towards a higher likelihood of committing a crime and using my tax dollars to help minimize that likelihood sounds like a good investment into the wellbeing of this state. 
2366,"The best ways prisons can ensure the safety of their staff, contain costs, and meet inmates’ needs is by providing the necessary treatment for inmates to be rehabilitated. Providing treatment that will help inmates be rehabilitated will lower the rate of recidivism which reduces how many individuals are being incarcerated and therefore reducing the amount of money spent on incarceration. The proportion of inmates with mental illnesses is generally estimated to be about 16% with an estimated 45% of inmates with mental illness also showing comorbidity of severe mental illness and a substance use disorder (Adams & Ferrandino, 2018).  According to a study done by Baillargeon et al. (2009), inmates with comorbidity had a significantly higher risk of multiple incarcerations within a 6-year period when compared to inmates who had a psychiatric or substance use disorder alone. In the same study, the researchers stated that fewer than a third of inmates with comorbid disorders received appropriate mental health treatment within the last year, threatening their ability to be rehabilitated which could lead to reincarceration. Inmates with mental illnesses are also more likely to commit infractions such as assaults and other forms of violence; threatening the safety of correctional officers, themselves, and others (Adams & Ferrandino, 2018). Prioritizing getting inmates with mental illnesses the treatment needed to be able to work on their impulsivity, decision-making skills, and coping styles would allow them a fair shot at not being reprimanded as often and not reenter the criminal justice system. When an inmate with a mental illness commits and infraction, correctional officers and administrators are in a tricky situation where they must maintain order while also not trying to punish inmates for behavior that is beyond their control because of their mental illness (Adams & Ferrandino, 2018). Prison staff, especially correctional officers should receive specialized training that teaches them about mental illness and strategies on how to interact, communicate, and deescalate situations with inmates who have mental illnesses. According to Slate et al. (2013), only 7 states report having some sort of specialized training for correctional officers on mental illness and these training tend to total up to only 4 hours. Providing training will not only help correctional officers deescalate situations that could have ended violently but it will help m"
2367,"Hi Wendy,  I like your recommendation to focus both on risk assessment and on the treatment of an inmate with a mental illness. As you mentioned the risk assessments will not only allow us to see their likelihood for recidivism in the context of releasing them but it can also the appropriate treatment method that the inmate should have.  In addition to what you said, I would add that having multiple assessment periods is important to not only understanding their risk but seeing if their form of treatment is working (Adams & Ferrandino, 2008 ). This multi-test approach would be beneficial to get more accurate information on the inmates since risk assessments are not entirely accurate (Adams & Ferrandino, 2013).  I also believe that the initial costs of treatment may be high but will be an investment that pays off as inmates with mental illnesses will be able to receive treatment that can rehabilitate them and reduce their rate of recidivism.  The cost of temporary treatment will be substantially lower than the price of incarceration for several years when an offender re-offends. It is a long term investment but ultimately it would reach the goals of keeping costs down and equipping offender with skills needed to keep from reentering the system. "
2368,"Hi Lisa,  Your emphasis on the cost of medication is an important point for this discussion. It was interesting to learn that medication was the usual go-to move for treatment while also being the most expensive. Personally, this points to a problem that pharmaceutical companies have caused by the high prices of medication. Psychotropic medications can be difficult to pay for even to a citizen who is not incarcerated and if prisons must now budget for the cost of medications to thousands I can see how it would make a significant dent in their budget. While we are not focused on taking on the problem of medication costs, I like the recommendation you made to focus on treatment outside of the prison environment. This can be a great way to prevent individuals with mental illnesses from entering the criminal justice system in the first place. The cost of treatment for some of these mental illnesses is significantly smaller than how much it costs within the prison system. Using other facilities as rehabilitation centers could ultimately be beneficial to the cost of treatment, recidivism rates, and safety of prison staff. "
2369,My only question was if there was any specific reason that on average female inmates receive less outside time than male inmates?
2370,"I would be happy about the construction of the new Fulton State Hospital. As the lecture video pointed out, one of the criticisms of the state hospitals is that they were prison-like and that their physical layout was not conducive to treatment, this rebuild will allow for properly guided updates to the look and feel of this state hospital in order to help with the implementation of treatment. As the Cheif Operating Officer stated, this building was originally built without considering updated ways of treatment and this upgrade will allow for this facility to offer the people who will inhabit it, programs such as group therapy and other forms of therapy that will allow them to receive the appropriate treatment for their needs. The facility will allow for the implementation of humane treatment and for a place in which people can feel supported and safe enough to allow themselves to receive treatment and be rehabilitated. If I were a taxpayer of Missouri I would be proud of my state for making an important investment into taking a step forward on our treatment of PWMI. "
2371,"I would not call the Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity a ""Get out of Jail Free"" because they still have to serve an equal period to the max sentence of their most serious offense but instead of within a prison they must do this within a state hospital. They are still receiving mandatory sentencing the difference here is that sending them to prison would not allow them to get treatment to understand what their crime was, why it is wrong, and how it impacted others. Without this understanding, the punishment of prison would not be fully understood by the offender which would be counterintuitive to the point of sending them to prison. If they do not understand their crime or why it was wrong then there is no way that prison would be able to deter them from committing that crime (or another one) again. "
2372,"From my understanding, state hospitals need to budget or increase funding in order to hire more staff that could be available and properly trained to handle patients within state hospitals. It seems like the shortage of properly trained staff seems to be the major issue. I think that it is important that staff and administrators of state hospitals can have an open dialogue about what are the gaps in their hospital. If administrators do not know what the staff needs more support in then there is very little they can do. It is also extremely important that administrators create an environment in which their staff can feel safe and heard when giving feedback and input on how to improve safety in state hospitals as well. From the video above, the commissioner of the department of mental health did not know that staff were using housekeepers and cooks to help with patients and was surprised by that. The commissioner, in this case, should not talk to staff to find out who to reprimand but instead use this information to come up with a better alternative for the state hospital staff. "
2373,"Presently, I am not opposed to doctors using deep brain stimulation as a treatment for depression. It has worked for individuals with severe depression and has resulted in their ability to feel better and increase their quality of life. The video mentioned that there are possible risks of brain damage, infection, and death. I would like to know what are the chances of these risks before I was to solidify my opinion on this. I definitely do not think this should be a common method but that it could be an option for an individual with severe depression who has not been able to find success in other therapeutic methods who has also demonstrated great effort in trying these other methods. "
2374,"I believe that it is appropriate that state hospitals and the criminal justice system have some sort of relationship. Half of all inmates have a substance abuse disorder or mental illness and out of these inmates, 15% of them have been diagnosed with a psychotic disorder (Sisti, Segal, and Emanuel, 2015). Inmates with a mental illness are two to three more likely to recidivate (Sisti, Segal, and Emanuel, 2015) and be reprimanded for infractions within prisons (Adam and  Ferrandino, 2008). The population of PWMI in our criminal justice system is why state hospitals should have a relationship with the criminal justice system. PWMI may fall into contact with the criminal justice system due to symptoms of their mental illness and police should be trained on how to recognize signs of mental illness in order to better approach high-risk situations. If it is found that the offender is mentally ill and is either incompetent to stand trial or not guilty by reason of insanity, they should be held in a state hospital to be rehabilitated. This is allows trained staff to properly handle the needs of these offenders. If state hospitals and the criminal justice system did not have a relationship, the criminal justice system would have to place those were found incompetent to stand trial or not guilty by reason of insanity into their prisons that are already struggling on how to provide appropriate care to prisoners with mental illnesses who have been found guilty and competent. If we embrace this relationship between the two systems, we can start to make pushes to reduce the presence of PWMI in the criminal justice system and introduce them to state hospitals first through civil commitments rather than being arrested and processed. If police are properly trained on mental health crises, instead of arresting and process some PWMI they may be able civilly commit them into state hospitals before a severe crime is committed. The current system in place is more likely to process and arrest a PWMI than civilly commit them but openly talking about the relationship state hospitals have with the criminal justice system can allow us to look at alternative ways of helping the PWMI community. In California, 90% of patients in state hospitals are forensic patients and the other 10% are civil commitments. I would advocate for hospitals to continue handling both forensic and civil patients while also looking at why a majority of patients are forensic patients. If some of the"
2375,"Hi Briana,  I liked that you pointed out the issues within state hospitals. Their need for more staff, updated facilities, and better training procedures for staff safety are a significant part of ensuring they can properly treat their patients. I too advocated starting taking a more preventive approach rather than intervening once a crime has been committed. In order for this to take place, our community-based mental healths service, state hospitals, and criminal justice program should work together in order to be able to refer patients into state hospitals. I like your additional point that state hospitals should grow to accept inpatient care for persons with severe mental illnesses. If state hospitals begin to embrace a more preventive based approach then they must start to figure out logistically how to handle forensic patients along with civil commitments. I think that though investing in state hospitals seems like a high price now if this treatment reduce the amount of PWMI who are incarcerated the long term cost of incarceration will outweigh the cost of their treatment. "
2376,"Hi Caroline,  I like your addition of patients' right. You brought in some new points to consider. In my post, I took the side that state hospitals should not solely work forensic patients and should instead work with community-based mental health service and the criminal justice system to develop a way in which they can civilly commit more PWMI instead of processing and arresting them. I'm interested to know what would you recommend state hospitals and the criminal justice system do with civil commitments if state hospitals only took in forensic patients? Would they have to open another type of facility for this or would this then become the job of general hospitals to handle in their psychiatric unit? Fisher, Geller, and Pandiani (2009) mentioned that some general hospital has been reluctant to admit patients who display a significant risk to their staff or display inappropriate sexual or other types of problematic behavior. They proposed that state hospitals may be better equipped to handle these patients which would be labeled a civil commitment. I wonder how we could encourage general hospitals to admit these patients if state hospitals were not an option.  I really enjoyed reading your post it raised a lot of new thinking points on this discussion. "
2377,The mental health system's ability to share information with the criminal justice system is important in ensuring that all inmates that need mental health help can receive appropriate treatment while incarcerated. As the lecture pointed out it is important that this information is shared without it jeopardizing an offenders' rights in criminal proceedings or violate their privacy. I think an important part that was shared in the video was educating those in the criminal justice system on the symptoms and impact of mental health so they can be more equipped to recognize mental illness in offenders which can then help them receive treatment. It would be beneficial for mental health and criminal justice staffers to have collaborative meetings where they could discuss and educate one another on the other field and hopefully build further communication on how they can better share information while still abiding by ethical and legal regulations. 
2378,The CIT trained approach differs from a routine law enforcement encounter in that it takes more time and is focused more on figuring out how the PWMI is feeling and what their current state of need is. It seems to be more focused on facilitating a conversation instead of controlling the scene. The CIT trained approach also seems to have multiple resources that can provide the extra help that law enforcement might not be able to.  It also seems like even the ambulance staff can help deescalate the individual as well if they feel uneasy about riding in an ambulance or going to a hospital.  CIT trained approaches also calls for the officers to look for different signals about the individual to understand if it is a mental health crisis and how to facilitate the conversation or adjust the environment to not further escalate the situation but to allow the PWMI to feel more at ease about complying with orders and trusting the officers. 
2379,I think it can be daunting for departments of corrections to add on training or reconsider processes already in place and the court order helps make them realize the urgency of this problem to be treated with. It is estimated that somewhere between 10-15% of inmates have a mental illness so it may not seem like the biggest problem that departments of corrections would prioritize considering it is not a majority of their population. Departments of corrections might also subscribe to the same stigma that society does and not see how these types of inmates can be treated differently because they are perceived to be violent and a lost cause. It will not be until staff in the departments of corrections are educated to understand what a mental illness is and how it impacts one's behaviors and attitudes will they be able to understand how important it is that we ensure that they are getting properly treated within our prisons and jails. 
2380,Mental health workers have to deal with other staffers' stigma on mental health along with the stigma that prisoners face. This impacts mental health workers because when trying to speak to other corrections staff it may be hard to break through these stigmas in order for them to gain a better understanding of inmates with mental illness so that more people can advocate for them to receive the treatment that they need. They also deal with an environment that teaches inmates to not trust anyone and to be cautious of others whereas in treatment you want the patient to trust and feel like they are not being judged. Mental health workers have to break through this wall with the inmates in order to show them that they can trust the mental health workers and that they care about their best interests. I think cross-training will help other corrections staff to see the need that PWMI has and for them to assist mental health workers in finding ways to bring opportunities to PWMI who are incarcerated. Cross-training can also help all corrections staff keep an eye out for mental illnesses symptoms and quickly refer them to get the help that they need before it begins to impact their attitudes and behaviors. 
2381,"The Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) Model is considered a “Best Practice” model in law enforcement and can have promising results for all mental health and criminal justice staff (Watson & Fulambarker, 2012). The CIT Model is the current best training that staff can be provided with to benefit PWMI. The CIT model involves several aspects of both the mental health and criminal justice systems such as coordination between law enforcement, ambulances, and mental health services in the area (Watson & Fulambarker, 2012). Memphis law enforcement suggests that the implementation of CIT has lowered arrest rates, increased safety, and increased access to mental health services (Watson & Fulambarker, 2012). The issue that arises with the CIT model is that some researcher attributes its success to law enforcement having a central designated psychiatric emergency drop off (Watson & Fulambarker, 2012). Not all law enforcement agencies have this type of local resource and may have to drive past nearing cities in order to find a location. Though this may pose a difficulty to the CIT model I think that the aspects of the model that are absolutely essential to benefit PWMI is that the training covers topics such as basics on what mental illness is, symptoms of several mental illnesses, treatment options, mental illness’ relationship with crime, and strategies for interacting with PWMI that would include roleplaying. Any training that covers these topics would benefit mental health and criminal justice staff in understanding PWMI but also equip them with strategies on how to interact or diffuse situations on the job. Developing understanding will help mental health and criminal justice staff comprehend the needs of PWMI, especially in moments of crisis and instead of reacting in a manner that would trigger unfavorable behaviors they will be able to implement tactics that help diffuse these situations. In Parker’s (2009) study, the mental health training developed by the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) saw a decline in the number of incidents, the force used by officers, and battery by bodily waste after both phases of training.  The NAMI training had topics on diagnostic criteria of mental illness, the biology of mental illness, an overview of treatment, and how to interact effectively with PWMI (Parker, 2009). This type of training can be especially beneficial to correctional officers who are actively interacting with PWMI. Correctional"
2382,"Hi Serenity,  You had really concrete points on the importance of the aspects of training you decided to highlight. I especially appreciated your point that all actors who work with PWMI should have knowledge of the rights of PWMI. I had not considered this point in my own discussion point but you bringing it up reminds me of how important it is that PWMI and those who work to help them know the rights that they have especially in regards to treatment in a correctional facility. You also highlighted the importance of knowing their rights in order for mental health professionals to protect their privacy and the right to consent. This can become an incredibly troubling topic especially when it comes to receiving consent for treatment in situations like not competent to stand trial. I had similar sentiments in my post about understanding the sign of mental illness, destigmatizing mental illness, and equipping individuals who work with PWMI with skills and tactics to diffuse situations. The detection of mental illness is incredibly important in order to refer them to treatment but also to restrategize how to approach intense situations like mental health crisis. I feel like the CIT model has been the best example that we have learned about in this class that would contain all of these aspects into their training. "
2383,"Hi Elise,  I hadn't even considered the impact that having these type of training for school staff could have. I think that this would be a great way of being able to get PWMI treatment earlier and before their behaviors lead to contact with the criminal justice system. It would also be beneficial because a large portion of our population goes through the public education system and if we could provide any type of mental health literacy to all public educators we would be able to treat more people earlier on the development of their disorder. In this case, it would be important to cater training to fit the developmental age that the teachers deal with on a day to day basis.  Some disorders such as schizophrenia can develop later into earlier adulthood but hopefully, since mental health literacy would become a normal part of public education there will be a significant population of students who will grow up more literate on mental health issues and can help those friends, peer, and family members who need mental health services. "
2384,"Hi Elise,  I like that you pointed out the video that demonstrated how the CIT model works in the field. One thing that stuck out to me about that video was that when the two officers entered the home the PWMI dismissed one of the officers that began talking. Instead of seeing this as resisting or disrespectful they simply adjusted by letting the other officer speak to the PWMI in order to diffuse the situation. I could see where without proper training to understand the symptoms of mental illness an officer could take this immediate interaction and escalate it further into a scenario that may have ended up with an arrest. Training that focuses on educating on symptoms, treatment, etc. are incredibly important but they should also have a roleplaying section where they go through different scenarios of what could happen while on the job so that they can practice how they would react in real-time. I also think having alumni of the training come into pieces of training can beneficial because they can share stories about how they used that training on the job and to answer any questions that those who are being trained might have. Overall though i do agree that the central focus should be education. "
2385,"I think that Fairfax focuses on non-violent offenders instead of violent offenders because the belief is that violent offenders would have a lot more needs and support in order to be rehabilitated because they have already crossed a line that inflicts physical pain onto another which differs from cries on non-violent offenders. Due to the violent nature of their crime, it is harder to promote a diversion program instead of an arrest.  I believe that someone who has committed a violent crime would still need to receive treatment but through the duration of their arrest. The violent offense may be more severe and it would be harder to promote a diversion program to handle it but they should still get mental health help while still going to the normative criminal justice program. "
2386,I think that in both systems there are individuals who are hesitant for change as some feel that their methods work best and introducing a new one will not work as well as the one they have been using for years. Some workers in these two systems may be set in their ways and be reluctant to change up their methods but I think that mental health agencies compared to the criminal justice system may have an easier time implementing evidence-based practices. It is more likely that workers in the mental health agencies are more aware of how psychological sciences develop over time and more likely to be open to adjustments and adopting change whereas criminal justice may be seen as more cut and dry. I think the different type of training the workers of each system get is different and it impacts their ability to adjust to newer methods. I still think that mental health agencies have to deal with hesitancy but not at the same level as the hesitancy in criminal justice. 
2387,"I think that an integrated MH and Substance Abuse model like the one described in the movie will allow for people to receive appropriate treatment for their needs which will allow for the justice system to see that punitive measures are not always the way to deter future crime. It can hopefully switch the singular perspective on crime that some have that people commit crimes out of their own malicious intention but that when provided with treatment on MH and/or substance abuse problems they can become functioning and effective members of society. Hopefully, the communities that use this service will result in lower crime rates and lower rates of PWMI who interact with the criminal justice system in order to show the justice system that programs like this one work for the greater good of the individual as well as the society. This can open more police departments and mental health services up to working with one another to ensure that their community is provided treatment that is needed."
2388,Peer mentoring can help PWMI deal with issues they may face back out in their community. It can allow PWMI to talk through and strategies how to handle their mental health crisis in their normative day-to-day routine. It also allows PWMI to feel like they are supported by a community and allows them to have someone to reach out to someone who can understand more deeply your concerns. Having this type of peer can help PWMI feel more confident about presenting themselves to the public at work or school in a manner that shows that PWMI are not someone you need to fear. This can help breakdown stereotypes that others have about mental illness and really normalize that these are things that people go to. 
2389,"The recommendations made by the American College of Physicians are intended to combine primary care with mental health care (Munetz and Teller, 2003). The six recommendations include; primary care doctors addressing mental health, removing payment barriers, strengthening non-discrimination policies, streamlining the most effective treatment and integration approaches, providing continuing education and cross-training for mental health and primary care physicians, and reducing stigma held by general population and the medical community (Crowley and Kirschner, 2015). Removing payment barriers and strengthening non-discrimination policies would be recommendations that strengthen the involvement of PWMI in the criminal justice system as these two recommendations would help open up the possibility for PWMI to research appropriate mental health care from their physician. Many individuals, in general, are unsure if mental health services are covered by insurance and if not are too costly to try and pursue. Strengthening discrimination policies will allow protections for PWMI who seek help to not be dismissed for the care of their mental illness. Primary care doctors addressing mental health and reducing stigma would benefit the identification of PWMI in the criminal justice system. Addressing mental health will benefit identification as it begins a process of normalizing mental illnesses and allows individuals who visit physicians for medical help to begin to discuss mental health problems that may lead down the road to a diagnosis. This diagnosis can then be shared with family and friends who under the case of a criminal justice contact can share that information with police officers in order to better approach situations like mental health crises that officers may be called for. Reducing the stigma of mental illness can in general just open up more discussions about mental illness and the approach needed to handle mental health crises in households and in the criminal justice system. It is important to note that the stigma surrounding substance abuse must also be reduced, especially in the medical system, as medical professionals can become jaded towards those with substance abuse problems because it is seen as something, they are doing to themselves. It is important that both stigmas are reduced as many PWMI also suffer from substance abuse issues. Streamlining effective treatment and integration approaches while also providing continuing ed"
2390,"Hi Elyse,  I agree with your point that integrating behavioral aspects into the health care system and primary care would benefit the identification of PWMI in the criminal justice system. You asserted that this could increase the use of mental health assessments before, during, and after incarceration which makes sense as it would, in general, open the doors to considering mental health issues in a normative way that physical health issues are considered. Early diagnosis, as you said, can help PWMI receive treatment that will allow them to equip skills that they can use in situations where they may find themselves interacting with police officers especially in mental health crises. I made a similar point in that it would also help friends and families learn how to handle mental health crises in the household along with letting police officers know that the PWMI has a mental illness if they call police officers. In general, I think this recommendation help promote normalization of mental health issues which ultimately helps reduces stigmas on mental illnesses and opens up room for conversations on how to handle it. "
2391,"Hi Nani,  I really liked that you focused on these recommendations helping me a preventive measure to PWMI in the criminal justice system. As you pointed out more people are likely to reach out to physicians about mental health care before they actually go to a mental health professional. This alone is a great enough reason to ensure that our physicians are equipped with the skills and practices needed to understand how to guide their patients into receiving treatment for their mental health needs. If more people can be supplied with proper treatment for their mental health issues than long term the impact can be that we will see less PWMI being in contact with a police officer because of untreated mental illnesses.  Patients should also be made aware of the financial costs of mental health services along with assistance in how to get information on whether or not insurance will cover it. As recommended, the barriers that finances put on receiving these treatments need to be reduced in order for PWMI to gain access to these necessary services. Great post Nani! "
2392,"It is clear based on some of the behaviors and actions that Timothy Sounders displayed, that he had some serious mental issues. The fact he attempted to commit suicide on a number of occasions as well as neglecting to drink liquids should have been serious red flags. The prison did him injustice by not providing him with some sort of mental specialist or psychiatrists who could have at least attempted to provide him the mental aide he clearly needed. "
2393,Mental illness was thought to be a defect in spirituality and morality and treatment methods were not backed in science. Some of these surgeries were truly horrific and were completely devoid of humane practices. Mental illness throughout the ages has caused a lot of confusion and dissent as to its causes and clearly was not something that more ancient civilizations were able to solve and combat in ethical ways. 
2394,"To call gun violence rhetoric in this country a pressing issue would be a gross understatement and I am of the stance of significant reform. However, no, given we are looking at such a small percentage of mentally ill people who turn violent I do not believe the national registry outweighs the cost of it. The claims that it is the mentally ill individuals who are consistently causing the atrocities in this nation is outdated and unbacked by evidence and simply is used to scapegoat the mentally ill rather than the main perpetrators of gun violence in an effort so people can maintain their 2nd Amendment rights.  "
2395,I think one important problem to fix is the education of mental illness. The masses in our society do not have full understanding of mental illness and simply play on what they have learned in movies or certain stories and believe that this applies to the majority of PWMI's when in fact it is actually an overwhelmingly minority who become violent and engage in the egregious and heinous crimes that have occurring across the United States. 
2396,"For centuries the mentally ill have been viewed as inferior and have been seen as social pariahs in society. As the times have modernized the stigma about mental illness has definitely somewhat changed. Past civilizations used to handle mentally ill individuals in horrific and at times brutal ways. Many believed that the illnesses we now know to be (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, severe anxiety and depression etc.) were believed to be the work of dark and evil spirits and demons entering one's soul and causing him or her to act in such a way. Thus, these individuals became outcasts and members of the population who deserved ridicule as they were deemed unfit to serve properly in society.  As times have progressed from absurd practices such as trephination, the idea of mental hospitals have popped up throughout history starting in the Renaissance Era. However, mental health for centuries has been associated with low economic standing and these hospitals or mental health care centers were only instituted in a way the wealthy could benefit from it. And even those who were able to afford to send themselves or family members to these hospitals were consistently mistreated, given incorrect diagnoses, and still viewed as degenerate 2nd class citizens.  The mischaracterization and misunderstanding of PWMI in today's world is astonishing.  Without learning what I have acquired from this graduate program, I too would probably be severely misinformed and have preconceived notions of mental illness that are sorely untrue. Unfortunately, the masses do have these notions and many of them are invalid and we see the narratives that media and motion pictures for example portray for us. If you ask someone about gun violence, a likely response would be they assume the person has some sort of severe mental illness/impairment. But as we have learned 4% of these individuals actually turn to violence of this sort. These individuals in a lot of ways are unfairly subjected to separation from the general public and until narratives change, these people will be unjustly persecuted for undeserved reasons. It's 2019, the world should have a better grasp of issues like these but there is still so much work to be done. "
2397,"Hello Caroline, What an insightful post you have provided here! You did a great job of highlighting the issue of how SES has been a huge part of this issue. I touched on it a little bit but you really laid it all out there I think it is a sometimes overlooked component to mental health care especially. I also really liked your concluding paragraph and how you talk about some of the improvements that are being made in the current time because it is clear that substantial strides had to be made in this area. Hopefully at time progresses less people will be ashamed and fear ostracization at knowing their brain works in different ways and they have certain challenges others may not, and be willing to come forward and getting treatment they need. "
2398,"Hi Karen, I enjoyed reading your post because I think you made some insightful points. I think it is important to discuss victimization and how that is a big aspect of how these individuals are viewed in our society. I talked a little in my post about how we hear stories or read books or watch movies that show mental ill people in this sort of light when in reality it does not really accurately portray these individuals for the most part at all. Hopefully there is more integration and the stigma around these individuals continues to change and development especially as we learn more about PWMI scientifically. "
2399,"Well for one, caring about someone other than him or herself would be helpful. But on a more serious note, a sitting president of the US has an enormous platform and can create dialogue that then becomes a national conversation. In this age of social media combined with all the major tv news stations, when a president talks about an issue it has the potential to be debated and dissected on a national scale.   "
2400,"Plain and simply, it is an unfortunate indication that mental health really is not a significant area of concern among policy makers. Though it absolutely should be given significant attention given our nation, psychological issues are not viewed as an urgent threat and thus somewhat cast aside in its importance. It's almost ironic how we are talking about this currently and the Joker (albeit a fictional story) is about this very issue. Mental illness doesn't have a ""cure,"" per se and because of that policymakers clearly have shown a lack of persistence in raising the necessary resources in order to really combat these issues.  "
2401,"Exclusively providing a former active military serviceman medication and calling that a solution is severely misinformed and lacking of understanding. Just this short portrayal of what military life is like is horrifying and can obviously leave permanent scars on the psychology of an individual. Thus, there has to be more therapy sometimes on a case by case basis in which legitimate diagnoses can be made and then medication can play a role and supplement other forms of psychological treatments. As a non-military serviceman we have no way of comprehending the psychological trauma these men and women go through, but it is imperative some of these treatments especially of the mental therapeutic variety. "
2402,"This is an extremely difficult question to answer. Because on the one hand there are protections in place so people don't overly infringe on one's liberties. However, when an individual is PWMI do they know? So, I think society should be able to step in in certain situations, especially when they can be deemed severe. I think people have to be somewhat sensitive to not be too invasive on people's personal business. But yes, there are circumstances society should mandate treatment when the person poses a threat to themselves and/or others. "
2403," The stigma surrounding mental illness stems from by and large from misunderstanding. So much of the news floating around regarding  mental illness deals with very specific cases, like shootings which have been carried out by people with mental illness. Stories such as these inspire fear in the general public, and with so many people having so little knowledge of what mental illness truly means, it is easy for misconceptions to be made. The conscious and subconscious reactions to these stories is that one should distance themselves from people with mental illness. This is very damaging. People are removing themselves from people and situations that they know nothing about, and are therefore removing themselves from the possibility of ever truly understanding what mental health is, and how having it truly impacts people. This is not an issue that can be solved quickly. The stigma surrounding mental illness is so engrained in the minds of developed Americans that no amount of convincing will be enough to reverse public opinion. Therefore, the target of education must be America's youth. Removing the stigma begins with educating our youth on mental illness so that they can, when they're adults, form their own, more educated opinions on the subject of mental illness. What then, exactly, should go into the curricula? I believe that it's actually very straight-forward. To remove the stigma, people first need to understand what mental illness means and how it impacts people. First off, people need to understand all the different types of mental illness and what they mean. This should be taught in coursework, especially at the middle and high school levels especially. But most importantly, it is vital that mental illness is shown not just in a negative portrayal. People need to understand that even though some may think differently or their brain works in some way, does not mean that cannot succeed and even thrive spectacularly. Maybe a week or a couple days every year could be put aside to specifically go over certain issues. Schools could have speakers to come in or could break the students into small groups to discuss and ask questions and learn from educators. It is important for people in power (like the president and lawmakers) to bring awareness to mental health issues but it is paramount for it to really be engrained in the younger generations in schools if changes are to continue. "
2404,"Hi Suzanna, What an insightful post you have written, I agree that early intervention is always important. Preconceived notions can sometimes be extremely hard to change in a person, let alone a society, so the earlier awareness can be spread the better. I think how you talk about how children go home to their parents and want to discuss what they have learned especially at a young age is spot on and if educators could find these creative ways of accomplishing this, that would be excellent to really start these conversations at an even earlier than I was thinking. In my case, overloading information too much too fast has never necessarily been ideal for me, but i do think in some ways can be impactful if spread out over a number of days. Such as, when my classmates and I first learned about sex-ed, they spread those conversations across multiple days consecutively, which I felt was very effective. "
2405,"Hi Jennifer, I agree with many of the assertions you make in your post. And I agree with your premises, the only thing I might add is specific ways the may do this. Because it is clear that it is vital to educate the younger generations about mental illness while they are still formulating opinions. But I think it would be important to having this done through multiple levels of the education system. I think at the elementary level children are open to learning new things so getting certain ideas in their head would be a great start, however, once they begin to mature more in their middle school and high school years, having certain lessons and education rehashed to them would be extremely beneficial as well.   "
2406,"Based on the video specificity and sensitivity when applied to something like civil commitment is a complicated issue. On the one hand, society would more likely prefer standards with higher sensitivity in order to keep likely repeat offenders of the streets. However, this also will likely unfairly force a greater number of false tests that force individuals to remain in civil commitment when they should not be. So these risks either way are from ideal. Even the percentages used in the video (90% and 83%) on its head are not bad, but still leave a significant amount for error. Thus, more thorough evaluation is probably to way to move forward. "
2407,"I think overall it is a good idea. I cannot pretend like I know what prison is like and frankly I don't really want to know. But everyone reacts to their time locked up differently. Some find themselves and better themselves. Others will continue the same behaviors that got them incarcerated in the first place. In the case of those suffering mental illness, it is not likely their demons have just up and disappeared. So, I think it would potentially do some good if these individuals were involuntarily committed following their release. However, this could be a case by case basis as well, as I would not just say all individuals should be committed, but for the most part I think it would definitely be beneficial. "
2408,"I think inpatient commitment is definitely the larger reach of state authority. With outpatient commitment there is a much greater amount of autonomy and the individuals are essentially allowed to carry on with their daily lives uninhibited. Contrarily, inpatient commitment forces the patients to live in a contained space that is not their normal place of residence and are not allowed to leave, except maybe other than for brief periods. Thus, clearly given this fact alone, inpatient limits the liberties of the committed patients . "
2409,"There are definitely pros and cons to both inpatient and outpatient involuntary commitment. For inpatient commitment, it serves as a way to provide individuals who are clearly suffering from certain mental illnesses a haven in which they can rehabilitate themselves with trained doctors until they are deemed ready to rejoin society without being a danger to themselves or others. However, some of the cons associated with inpatient commitment is that are considered quite coercive in their practices as well as being labeled as discriminatory, stigmatizing, and even anti-therapeutic. They also remove the individual from society and force them to ""rehab"" in a secure location they must remain until they are deemed fit for society, limiting their liberties.  For outpatient involuntary commitment has its drawbacks as well. Perhaps the most appealing part of outpatient commitment is it allows the patients to essentially continue their normal lives unencumbered in comparison to inpatient. There has also been a positive amount of success in regard to outpatient when considering medication compliance and a low rate of outpatient needing to be transferred to in. However, outpatient still is very coercive, especially with minorities like blacks, who were exceedingly hospitalized and discriminated against.  I think the most effective ways to evaluate success is how these individuals are able to interact with their families and their society. It may be difficult to measure that, but the goal of these treatments should be to help these individuals go on to live productive and as fulfilling lives as they can. It is not these people's fault that they have mental illnesses and hopefully they can find comfort in knowing they are on a path toward recovery and they are not alone. And as we have talked about, as a society we have to do a better job of educating others about mental illness and learn the being a PWMI does not just make them a danger to others, in most cases quite the opposite. "
2410,"Hi Jennifer,  I generally agree with your pros and cons. I think in a lot of ways the cons are actually quite similar in that they are generally viewed as coercive, anti-therapeutic, discriminatory, etc. But, I think it is important that we have in and outpatient commitment because there are some individuals who are in dire need of certain programs to improve themselves and their quality of life down the road. What's difficult is if there always is a clear indicator, but if there is that person should be more likely to be in inpatient. "
2411,"HI Bethanie,  I think you have written a great post here. I think you very clearly analyze the pros and cons of both, but I really like how you incorporated sensitivity and specificity to conclude your post. Because this is the real world application and you acknowledge how difficult it is and how error is unfortunately just par for the course with this type of testing. And I agree with you that a slight inflation of sensitivity would be the most beneficial to society and these individuals and your explanation for it is spot on!"
2412,Bethannie** 
2413,"I think the most difficult criminal process for PWMIs would be the adjudication stage. During this stage, the defendants are asked to determine how they will plead and if they will decide to take a plea deal. For PWMI this process could be very confusing and stressful given some of the complexities of the legal system and despite being read or explained their rights, not have a true understanding of their rights."
2414,"Mental health programs will likely not be as available to PWMI in local jurisdictions. Without the help from these programs PWMI will not get the treatment they need, and therefore will be more likely to be forced back into the system after they are released. However, one of the potential benefits is these individuals will not necessarily be locked up far away from their home towns, which will maybe allow for family and friends to have greater access to these PWMI individuals than they might otherwise. "
2415,"I do not think it is ""fair"" for police officers to be 1st responders for PWMI because police officers tend to not have the proper training to most adeptly handle these situations. Given that police officers are not trained to deal with these circumstances, it is almost unfair for them to blindly into situations that could cause reactions like in the video above where a fatality to a woman with schizophrenia is the result. So no, until police receive the adequate knowledge and training, they should not be first responders in these cases. "
2416,"As we have discussed on a myriad of occasions in this course, there is a stigma that mentally ill people tend to be violent, which is perpetuated in numerous forms. CIT attempts to de-stigmatize this notion and has already had a positive impact on the changing of that narrative. With the education of PWMI for police officers and ways to determine if someone has a mental illness, they will be much better equipped to handle situations with PWMI and will help debunk the false stigma that persists in this country about the mentally ill and the likelihood of violence. "
2417,"Even though the findings provided in the Taheri study are not necessarily conclusive, I believe that the CIT is a valuable model that should continue to be used and eventually should be implemented completely. CIT is a system which allows officers to become more educated about PWMI and thus serves as a deterrent to incarcerate certain PWMI and instead have them transferred to psychiatric health clinics that will allow them to get the treatment they need Taheri (2016). CIT also is intended to deter certain forms of violence on behalf of both PWMI and police officers, such as how the schizophrenic woman was shot by law enforcement, serving as an example of how that crisis could and likely should have been averted. The methods that CIT provide teach law enforcement officials interaction techniques with PWMI which will hopefully play a significant role in de-escalating certain situations that could turn violent in future instances.  I think it is clear that the studies that Taheri evaluates need to be beefed up, but I think the signs are definitely there and CIT will be serve as a positive between law enforcement and PWMI moving forward. The CIT should be a uniform method countrywide and there will be tangible benefits. There is no positive in sending someone who is PWMI to jail when they could be sent to a mental health clinic to be evaluated and treated. This not only gives them an opportunity to succeed in the future but it also decreases the likelihood they will continue in the system with untreated illnesses that may only augment will incarcerated. "
2418,"Hi Georgie, This is a Great post! I think you do a really good job of exploring the limitations of the Taheri findings, especially with how they acquired their data and how it likely is riddled with skews and inconsistencies. Clearly, there has to be a more effective way of doing this in the future and I think it would yield positive results moving forward. I agree with your recommendations and your assertions that CIT will pay dividends in terms of de-stigmatization of PWMI among law enforcement officials moving forward...and hopefully continue to progress among the general public. "
2419,"Hello Suzanna, What an insightful post you have provided here! I think you have done a very good job of dissecting why the Taheri yielded null effects. And I found your ideas on how to make these tests less skewed very intriguing and think you are spot in in your analysis. At the end of the day, as you state there were no negative results found in the study at all, so there is no reason to believe that CIT is not beneficial, and even if somehow it wasn't as beneficial as the majority of us seem to in this cohort, if there are positives that can attained it should absolutely be commonplace. "
2420,"I don't even want to imagine how hopeless and infuriating it must be for a PWMI to be jailed that consistently. But, clearly this serves as an indictment on a system that is either broken or unbelievably ineffective because that amount is beyond excessive. And long term there is no way this is benefitting anyone, least of all the PWMI. "
2421,"1. Looking at how many times an individual has been arrested. Law enforcement must try and find ways why this person keeps committing crimes and if they are receiving the proper resources (meds, therapy)  necessary to deter them from finding themselves locked up again and again.  2. Attempted suicide rates should be evaluated/monitored to gauge the likelihood of an individual inflicting more violence on themselves in the future and if different measures need to be considered. 3. If PWMI, upon release, are homeless or have terrible living conditions on the outside this should be evaluated to determine if there are certain policy changes in order and to see if there are other ways this situation could be handled. "
2422,"Overall, I think inmates are technically given enough rights for them to adequately go through their prison sentence. Most notably, they receive their rights to freely practice religion, are entitled to due process, qualify for health care, disallowed from being treated with cruel and unusual punishment, and others, as well.  Although these rights are in fact given to inmates, are they adhered to by the individual prison itself is the big question? I personally believe that even though these individuals broke the law and sometimes committed truly duplicitous acts, they deserve basic human rights as long as it does not endanger themselves or other inmates/guards. "
2423,"Though money is obviously an extremely valuable resource that allows jails to be run, the fact is, it is quite simply much easier to provide a PWMI medication rather than to have thorough therapy sessions, for example. Time is also an exceptionally value resource and this way, it is a quick-fix solution to get these inmates on their way as soon as possible. But of course, this is part of the problem due to misdiagnoses or getting to the true root of the mental illness. Again, however, medication is the easy solution that is definitely costly, but also saves a lot of time, energy, and money on the back end also. "
2424,"I do not believe that jail time for the seriously mentally ill is appropriate for a multitude of reasons. Not only do people with mental illnesses lead to jail overcrowding, but this process also slows down the justice system, costing the government millions of dollars. The money being invested into these mentally ill patients while they play the waiting game in jail cells could be better invested into proper, more immediate, psychiatric care. The money, resources, doctors, and physical space are simply unable to support this growing number of psychiatric patients. While one psychiatric bed supported every 300 people in the 1950s, our nation’s growing population of the mentally ill now only has access to one bed for every 3,000 people (Torrey et al., 2010). Additionally, jail physicians do not have the training, resources, or funding to adequately attend to these patients’ needs.   Beyond the functional concerns of jails for the mentally ill, it is morally inappropriate to punish somebody because of an illness. Jails are meant to be a place of punishment, and what the PWMI need is a place for treatment. Further, locking the mentally ill in jails with more serious criminal offenders could prove dangerous to the ill, impressionable, patients. Detaching these persons from the outside world and from professional care has shown to have detrimental health effects and feelings of isolation (Slate et al., 2013).   Realignment policy changes, though promising in their intentions, lead to overcrowding, underfunding, and ineffective operations within jails. With the demotion of lower-level crimes to misdemeanors through Prop. 47 and 57, more PWMI are being let free for their non-violent offenses. Despite the problems associated with jail time for the seriously mentally ill, other means of care must be put in place to ensure the safety of the mentally ill and their community. It is not a fair alternative to simply leave these people on the streets, no matter how petty the crime may have been (Raphael & Stoll, 2013). Rather, attention from mental healthcare facilities and professionals must be provided to these individuals. AB1810 is one example of progress towards justice for these mentally ill people. The amendment prioritizes mental health treatment over criminal proceedings, so long as the defendant proves safe to the community. More effective policies, such as this one, must be established to protect the seriously mentally il"
2425,"Alyssa, I completely agree with you that jails for PWMI prevent these people from getting the actual care that they need. Rather than addressing the root of the individual's behavior, their serious mental illness, jails punish them without any means of treatment. The architectural, funding, and operational constraints in local jails do not foster a healthy environment for these ill patients. Waiting around in over-crowded, understaffed, isolated jails hinders the improvement of PWMI. A more effective way to handle PWMI would be through mental healthcare facilities, access to psychiatric professionals, and more comprehensive treatment plans.  I also liked your point about the resource disparity across different counties. As overcrowding continues, the smaller, less-funded, counties will be less and less able to provide proper care options for the mentally ill."
2426,"Hi Steve! You bring up an interesting point about the threat that these PWMI pose to the public. Locking these individuals up in jail seems like a passive response to their behaviors. What these PWMI require is psychiatric treatment over punishment. Though jail time is not an easy punishment for any criminal, jail time can prove extremely counterproductive for seriously ill people. Often times, PWMI are stuck in jails without psychiatric medical expertise, sufficient space to live, nor contact with the outside world. This environment can lead to feelings of depression and loneliness in the mentally ill, stagnating or even hindering their treatment (Slate et al., 2013). It is concerning to think that the mentally ill are under the supervision of untrained guards in an underfunded institution. Though the goal should be to treat the needs of these patients, their conditions are often worsening due to these jail conditions. When these individuals do not provide any direct danger to themselves and to their community, jails should not be used to house the ill. Rather, the money being invested into housing those additional inmates in local jails should be diverted towards mental healthcare facilities. This way, the focus for handling PWMI is on constructive treatment by medical professionals rather than ineffective punishment. "
2427,"I think it is fair to use risk assessment tools but I do not think they should be the sole indicator. If they are used with other forms of assessment then I think they can augment one another to make the best determination possible. But considering, some of the shortcomings of risk assessments, I would not say it is completely ""fair"" if used on its own. "
2428,"I think MH professionals would only be somewhat receptive to the RNR approach. However, the research on this approach to this point are underwhelming and need to be studied further. But there are merits to it and I think there are definitely some positives with this approach when you consider how it focuses on factors such as substance abuse, anti-social behaviors etc., which is valuable information to evaluate these PWMI. "
2429,"I think probation does a solid job of addressing supervision and treatment especially when compared to jail. Probation allows these PWMI to stay out of jail, which some in the video had been in a litany of times, and a chance to receive the treatment they absolutely need.  And this way they are able to re-integrated into society under the necessary supervision and guidance instead of spending time behind bars without likely receiving any treatment and exacerbating their demons even more than they already are. "
2430,"I would prefer to be a participant in a mental health court rather than a traditional court because I would have an elevated level of comfort knowing that this court handles cases with PWMI with much more frequency. The judge, for example, would likely have a much better understanding of mental illness and how it affects behaviors in ways they may not be as familiar with in traditional court. Also, I would have access to certain resources I would not be granted in traditional court. But then again, this is easy to say and I think the benefits of this court would more likely keep me out of jail, but PWMI are already people who are scorned and looked down upon in society and people could argue that needing a separate court perpetuates a ""lesser-than"" mindset.  "
2431,"Developed by Andrews and Bonta in the late 1900s, the risk-need-responsivity, or RNR, principle theory focuses on reducing recidivism of criminal behavior. Being one of the more influential theories in criminal justice, RNR should be implemented with care when considering the MI because reducing offender recidivism is a highly individualistic process.   Skeem et al. (2015) discuss the problematic nature of this model through considering the three individual principle of risk, needs, and responsivity. With regards to the risk principle, the article warns of excluding low-risk offenders from recidivism treatments. The authors suggest extending these programs that were once targeted towards high-risk offenders to include lower-risk offenders. Thus, I would suggest that Chief Probation Officers incorporate even lesser offenders into their supervision to minimize the opportunity for risk factors to trigger criminal behavior for the MI. With the second principle of needs, the article cautions against reliance on “criminogenic needs.” The danger in this dependency on general risk factors is that each offender has individual triggers for criminal behavior; what motivates each MI offender to commit a crime is individualistic. While probation officers may first consider the “criminogenic” risk factors for crime such as peer relationships or substance abuse, a more comprehensive model is necessary to reduce recidivism for each individual. In the supervision of MI on probation, a Chief Probation Officer should investigate the records of offenders and monitor them in their everyday environments to discover these triggers. Finally, responsivity is arguably the most vital principle. The effectiveness and manner in which intervention is conducted can greatly lessen, or heighten, recidivism rates. Skeem’s main warning with responsivity is the “misuse” of intervention methods. When dealing with the MI, services must consider both the correction of the criminal behavior and the mental health of the offender. When advising a Chief Probation Officer about probation for the MI, it is crucial to have the proper resources and services for these individuals. A combination of correctional treatment and mental health services should be put in place throughout the probation process. Overall, in considering the cautions of Skeem et al. (2015) and the overall acceptance of RNR, more research must be conducted on the MI population specifically because not all criminal"
2432," Hi Lisa,  Great Post!  I think you some really good arguments here such as how you talk about substance abuse and its potential ties to recidivism and how looking at factors like this can be very beneficial. I also agree with your assertion that about how customization of programs and treatments tailored to individuals would most likely yield the best results because you simply cannot expect a blanket treatment to work for issues as complex as PWMI."
2433," Hello Jennifer,  I think you make some astute observations here! In any study, especially like that of RNR research, it is paramount that the data is able to adequately augment the arguments made, and for them to be valid, and thus be used more widespread. How you mention a case-by-case basis is exactly right, even though that is more difficult, that is the best way to get the most of out of these programs for PWMI and help set them on the right path moving forward. Well thought out!"
2434,"I think the prison environment exacerbates the conditions of PWMI in a number of ways. Prison is a chaotic and at times hostile place that could enhance of defeatist mindset, which may ultimately lead to an increase of suicidal thoughts, for example. As shown in the video and as we have discussed, the officers, in many cases,  do not have the sufficient knowledge and training of how to deal with these PWMI as well. "
2435,"I have some doubts that it is possible to ever completely rehabilitate prisoners with MI, however I do believe that they can make significant progress toward rehabilitating themselves to a particular extent.  Now, it is also depends of the severity of each individual's case, but with an adequate amount of allocated resources, and an individualized course of treatment suited to a specific mental illness, strides can absolutely be made. But mental illness is tricky and I don't think it's possible to ever truly have those thoughts, demons go away entirely. If there is structures and programs in place, however, the likelihood of recidivism should be lower and that should be one of the main goals of treatment. "
2436,"I think the disadvantages definitely outweigh the advantages of solitary confinement. Though the concept of solitary, in some ways, makes sense and can be used as a method of safety, overall solitary can very negatively affect individuals, especially PWMI. Being confined to solitary can trigger feelings of help/hopelessness while aggravating negative thoughts that may increase the likelihood of wanting to harm oneself. From a cognitive perspective, it simply is a terrible place for these individuals that can also cause hallucinations or other forms of delirium. "
2437,"I mean I don't think anyone truly feels necessarily great about paying taxes, even though they are 100% necessary for our system to function.  That being said, I have no qualms about my tax dollars going toward treating PWMI in prison, assuming it is in fact ""quality treatment."" The reality is this is an investment of people who will be a part of society if they are released and I think it is important that they get the support they need. So, considering that tax payer money goes toward the prison system, money should be allocated to provide the necessary therapy for PWMI. "
2438,"     For people with mental illnesses, prisons can enact a number of policies to protect the ill and their fellow inmates. One of the best ways to protect both groups of inmates would be to have separate living conditions for people with mental illnesses. By separating the mentally ill from the other criminal inmates, PWMI will be less influenced by the criminal habits of the other prisoners, they will be more protected from emotional distress, and can better adhere to their treatment plans with trained supervisors. More individualized treatment plans and more strict supervision will sustain these patients on the path towards rehabilitation and hold the mentally ill more accountable for changing their behavior through treatment (Slate et al., 2013). Though the mentally ill could be separated within prisons, rehabilitation outside of the prison system is another option. Community-based programs instead of, or in addition to, time in prison can ensure a smoother transition back into society while protecting the safety of inmates and community citizens alike.      In order for each of these promises to be fulfilled, more resources must be delegated to the ill. With these new resources, however, new costs will arise. It would be very difficult to maintain prison costs with increased staffing, treatment programs, and individualized care for the mentally ill. Thought important to maintain prison costs to a certain extent, more upfront, preventative expenses can eliminate long term consequential costs. Delegating a greater portion of prison budgets towards resources for the MI such as experienced therapists, intense training for supervisors, and more effective medications would reduce the risk of future costs (Adams and Ferrandino, 2018). Some of these future costs could include hospitalization of patients, dangerous acts of recidivism, or reentry into the criminal justice court system when rehabilitation is not thorough. Hospital expenses of restarting the rehabilitation process after acts of recidivism can prove costlier than nipping the criminal behavior up front with proper treatment for the mentally ill within the prison system.       With these considerations in mind, more resources or at least more unique resources should be designated to PWMI. Currently, there is a gap between the needs of the mentally ill and the resources available for their rehabilitation. The nature of mental illnesses makes these people more vulnerable to harsh pri"
2439,"Elise, I had a very similar response to the allocation of resources to the mentally ill and agree that more resources, including money, medication, and therapists, should be provided to PWMI. Preventative, upfront costs may eliminate the long-run expenses of recidivism. Some of the most constructive costs could be intense training for supervisors, hiring established psychiatrists, and community-based preventative programs (Slate et al., 2008). Prison budgets should focus on rehabilitating PWMI rather than punishing them because they are more vulnerable to the emotional distress of prisons. With more preventative measures, prison time could be reduced or even spared completely for the mentally ill. I found your point about screening assessments to be very interesting. By holding these preliminary screenings, we can identify risk factors and formulate the most effective treatment plans for each individual (Adams and Ferrandino, 2013). These screenings are another example of an upfront cost limiting later spending for it allows prisons to provide the proper resources and treatment plans for the mentally ill up front."
2440,"Hi Clara, great post! I took a similar viewpoint in providing more resources to the mentally ill than to the other criminal inmates. It is nearly impossible to fill the gap between prison costs and the needs of the mentally ill without more resources. We can justify this additional spending by considering the fragility of the mentally ill. When placed in the same prison conditions as normal criminal inmates, people with mental illnesses are more susceptible to distress such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, and fear (Adams & Ferrandino, 2008). Further, PWMI are also most susceptible to recidivism when they do not receive effective, personalized treatment. I liked that you point out the aftermath of the mentally ill as they have a difficult time reintegrating into society. They can be unproductive contributors to their community if they do not have access to proper treatment and medication during their prison time. To enhance their reintegration, inmates with mental illnesses need the opportunity to achieve employment, safe living conditions, and acceptance in their community. Granting this population more resources both within and outside of the prison system can benefit and protect society as a whole when these mentally ill patients are emerged back into society. How do you think that PWMI should be monitored beyond their time in the criminal justice system? Should followup treatment be required following their reappearance back into society?"
2441,"Given my knowledge of PWMI and incarceration, I would definitely be in support of the new Fulton State Hospital. I think based on what we have learned in this course, it is clear that it is important to have facilities such as these and if run currently, will have benefits especially for PWMI. However, if I were living in Missouri and didn't have some of the information I have acquired I may feel a little differently, hard to say. But, overall I think it is a worthwhile use of resources and my taxpayer dollars. "
2442,"No, I do not think ""get out of Jail Free"" card is a fair assessment of NGRI. Yes, technically you are out of jail, but it is not as though you are truly ""free"" at all. The individual has to be committed to treatment that may actually last much longer (potentially life sentence) than a jail sentence and forced to do ""time"" that way. Because of this there is no way it could be a free card because the very definition of what free implies is invalid due to the individual being committed to a regulated hospital in which they are forced to stay. "
2443,I think there needs to be more trained staff prepared and ready in case there are any unenviable situations that arise. These individuals need to have techniques that can de-escalate situations and know ways to minimize anything negative outcomes that could come about. It is very important that these people are trained heavily for the safety of all involved and it should be stipulated that they are. 
2444,"I am supportive of it and think that there are strong suggestions that it could be very beneficial. It is vitally important obviously to get patients to agree to it in full and an evaluation of the risks needs to be continued to be researched. Overall though, it seems to be an ethically complying surgery and the results look promising, but I  do not believe it should be the first course of action by any means. "
2445,"     Today, the admission of forensic patients into state hospitals has exceeded those admitted through civil commitment. This shift in population admittance allowed for forensic patients to make up nearly 90% of state hospitals (Fisher, Geller, & Pandiani, 2009). Regardless of this growing community of forensic patients, state hospitals should not be solely restricted for forensic patients because this excludes an entire population of individuals in need of care. State hospitals should not turn away patients in need of care solely on the basis that they are not “forensic.” I believe that the state has an obligation to provide accessible healthcare resources to all of its people, especially the people excluded from other mental health care facilities. Limiting the use of state hospitals to forensic patients would increase the number of PWMI entering the criminal justice system and being “housed” in prisons. Prisons should not replace mental health institutions because as we discussed last week, the current prison system is not necessarily equip to care for the individual needs of mentally ill patients.      One great advantage to state hospitals, supporting my position to expand hospital care beyond forensic patients alone, is their link to community services. Though there has been a recent decline in the number of state hospitals, the connection between these facilities and community-based resources cannot be discredited. These hospitals partner with residential programs, day treatment programs, case management, and other services that all benefit the clientele of that particular community (Fisher et al., 2009). People of all mental illnesses, not forensic patients alone, should be connected with these community services.      The current state hospital system must be reformed in order to meet the needs of a wider population of PWMI. Rather than closing these facilities all together, consolidating or restructuring existing state hospitals appears to be a better option. The signing of AB 1810 and SB 215 by Governor Jerry Brown also provides hope at restructuring this system. Under these two pieces of legislation, a pretrial diversion program was put into place for PWMI and resources were delegated towards felony diversion programs (DSH, p.10). These advancements are an example of proactive approaches towards keeping the mentally ill out of the criminal justice system. A retroactive problem-solving approach could be to separate patien"
2446,"Hi Jennifer, I took a similar perspective in that state hospitals can be made up of a majority of forensic patients, but they should not be exclusively for forensic patients. Excluding other groups of mentally ill individuals proves dangerous not only to the health of these individuals, but to the safety of the community as a whole. I am interested in your suggestion about screening individuals before their entering of the criminal justice system. I read that after the  Kansas v. Hendricks court cases, states began screening people towards the end of their hearings, right before sentencing. Do you think that screening individuals before they even begin their trials would prove more effective in determining their course of treatment? This way, those deemed unfit for the criminal justice system can get treatment in specialized mental healthcare facilities sooner and spare the resources of the criminal justice system."
2447,"Tamara,       I completely agree that in our criminal justice system's current position, state hospitals are a vital resource for PWMI that should not be taken away. These state hospitals protect forensic patients, and the more general population of mentally ill patients, from the unfit conditions of prisons. Just like you mentioned, prison conditions are more often counterproductive to the rehabilitation of the mentally ill because they are more likely to suffer from depression, anxiety, and loneliness in these environments (Slate et al.). Consequently, state hospitals have become a relatively effective alternative in caring for these patients. Why then do you think there has been such a major decline in state hospital facilities over the years? Do you think that we should focus on rebuilding these facilities or do you agree with Fisher et al. in that the hospital system is beyond repair?       Personally, I believe that these hospitals need to be redesigned to continue caring for the large population of forensic patients while also accommodating a broader community of PWMI. The short-term costs of consolidating these hospital systems would pay off in long-run benefits such as access to community-based services for the mentally ill and less overcrowding within the criminal justice system. "
2448,"I think overall data sharing seems satisfactory overall and is very important. However, there do need to be some improvements and communication criminal justice departments and mental health initiatives. For example, more comprehensive meetings between the two sides to help educate the other may be very beneficial. Also improvements in re-integration programs are needed also for PWMI. "
2449,"There definitely were some differences between the two approaches. The most notable was the calming disposition of the CIT officers. I also liked how instead of rushing to judgment the officers employed a de-escalation style approach, which is how these encounters should ensue. They also did a good job of explaining the situation in a disciplined way. "
2450,I think it takes a court order for dept of corrections to change because in a lot of ways PWMI are not considered a priority. The reality is these people are viewed in society in even in the correctional facilities as less than in the grand scheme. The workers also are not trained to the level they need to be to deal with PWMI either.
2451,"There are multiple challenges that mental health workers are forced to deal with in the CE. First and foremost they are tasked with the at times unenviable task of being in the presence of PWMI that are within a prison environment. Also, it may be hard to get these PWMI to understand that they are there to help them, but also that not any one treatment practice is applicable to the entire population. Cross training with correctional agencies and staff could be significant dividends. In many situations, I support the notion that the influx of information and brain power to an issue can be largely beneficial to have multiple ideals that can build on each other. Mental health workers are not correctional staff and their shared efforts would certainly increase the knowledge available and creates a greater likelihood of successful treatment for these PWMI. "
2452,"I feel it is essential for mental health and criminal justice actors to be knowledgable on how to interact with people with mental illness. This can be through a myriad of ways. For example, we have discussed the pros and cons of CIT training and its potential benefits to PWMI. However, we have also addressed that there is a need for greater data to be collected before it becomes a standard practice. But regardless of whether it is CIT or some other type of training, it is imperative that MHs and CJAs do engage in some type of training whether that includes de-escalation techniques or how to have understanding of the idiosyncrasies PWMI have in order to deal with certain unenviable situations that may arise (in a court setting or out). Parker (2009) found that training programs played a significant role in decreasing the amount of forceable incidents between officers and PWMI. This also could pay significant dividends in how PWMI are identified behind bars. If these specialists/actors are able to, in the court room or while incarcerated, recognize certain behaviors or red flags in an individual, there is in increase in the likelihood they will receive the requisite treatment early in their sentences that can aide them if and when they are eventually released. These protocols I believe are essential if progress is to be made in this area. Mental health associates and criminal justice actors obviously are paramount for the issue of PWMI and their treatment in the legal system and behind bars. Thus, there should absolutely be a greater sense of urgency to try and determine what is the most beneficial way they can assist PWMI and it should be uniform that there are programs to teach these individuals.     "
2453,"Hi Janee,  Great post! I really liked how you went into detail about CIT. I, myself, am a proponent of its implementation and think there are a lot of scenarios in which it can be extremely helpful. However, I think the only concern is that lack of definitive research on its merits. But, that being said, I think if and when there is more conclusive data to back its benefits, it should be a basic criterion that these individuals be trained in such a way. "
2454,"Hi Lisa, Well done! You were able to identify multiple ways these individuals can receive training. Quite frankly, it does not entirely matter what training medium they use, I just hope they find one that is overall very effective. I have been an advocate of CIT training, but I think NAMI treatment certainly has its distinct advantages as well. You also do a good job in your final analysis. Though it may be ""more work,"" the fact of the matter is, this is a mutually beneficial proposition which will assuage some of the issues between the PWMI and mental health specialists/criminal justice actors and vice versa.  "
2455,"I believe that diversion efforts are focused on non-violent offenders because these situations are more likely to be easily dealt and thus more likely but into a rehabilitative program rather than jail. With violent offenders, there is the thought that a situation may turn violent or have some negative results.   "
2456,"I think in some ways they are different and in some ways the same. On the one hand criminal justice and mental health agencies operate very differently in how they operate and some of their focuses. However, if there is not a substantial amount of data backed up giving credence to evidence-based practices, it is unlikely resources will be allocated without proper confirmed data. "
2457,I think an integrated would be extremely beneficial. There would be an influx of ideas and understanding on issues and it would play a significant role in the continued rehabilitation of these individuals that is simultaneously helping an person with multiple issues at one time. Part of the issue with our system is we have many specialists that only have knowledge on one subset of people. Combining certain fields or programs could go a long way into the spread of ideas and more comprehensive/effective programs. 
2458,"I think peer mentoring could be extremely helpful in addressing stigma regarding PWMI. These individuals can show that you can live a good, normal life even with mental illness. Sometimes it's just a comfort knowing there is somebody out there who has your back or shares in a similar struggle as you and that it is okay. These individuals provide that support that sometimes lacks in an individual's life so they can be positive and have a better outlook on their lives moving forward. "
